[This account originally appeared in a short work by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura entitled, "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: His Life and Precepts." (August 20, 1896)]

Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born in Māyāpur in the town of Nadia just after sunset on the evening of the 23rd Phālguna 1407 Śakābda, answering to the 18th of February, 1486, of the Christian Era. The moon was eclipsed at the time of his birth, and the people of Nadia were then engaged, as was usual on such occasions, in bathing in the Bhāgīrathī with loud cheers of //Haribol.// His father, Jagannātha Miśra, a poor //brāhmaṇa// of the Vedic order, and his mother, Śacī-devī, a model good woman, both descended from //brāhmaṇa// stock originally residing in Sylhet. Mahāprabhu was a beautiful child, and the ladies of the town came to see him with presents. His mother's father, Paṇḍita Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, a renowned astrologer, foretold that the child would be a great personage in time; and he, therefore, gave him the name Viśvambhara. The ladies of the neighborhood styled him Gaurahari on account of his golden complexion, and his mother called him Nimāi on account of the //nimba// tree near which he was born. Beautiful as the lad was, everyone heartily loved to see him every day. As he grew up he became a whimsical and frolicsome lad. After his fifth year, he was admitted into a //pāṭhaśālā// where he picked up Bengali in a very short time.

Most of his contemporary biographers have mentioned certain anecdotes regarding Caitanya which are simple records of his early miracles. It is said that when he was an infant in his mother's arms he wept continually, and when the neighboring ladies cried //Haribol// he used to stop. Thus there was a continuation of the utterance of //Haribol// in the house, foreshewing the future mission of the hero. It has also been stated that when his mother once gave him sweetmeats to eat, he ate clay instead of the food. His mother asking for the reason, he stated that as every sweetmeat was nothing but clay transformed, he could eat clay as well. His mother, who was also the consort of a //paṇḍita,// explained that every article in a special state was adapted to a special use. Earth, while in the state of a jug, could be used as a water pot, but in the state of a brick such a use was not possible. Clay, therefore, in the form of sweetmeats was usable as food, but clay in its other states was not. The lad was convinced and admitted his stupidity in eating clay and agreed to avoid the mistake in the future. Another miraculous act has been related. It is said that a //brāhmaṇa// on pilgrimage became a guest in his house, cooked food and read grace with meditation upon Kṛṣṇa. In the meantime the lad came and ate up the cooked rice. The //brāhmaṇa,// astonished at the lad's act, cooked again at the request of Jagannātha Miśra. The lad again ate up the cooked rice while the //brāhmaṇa// was offering the rice to Kṛṣṇa with meditation. The //brāhmaṇa// was persuaded to cook for the third time. This time all the inmates of the house had fallen asleep, and the lad shewed himself as Kṛṣṇa to the traveler and blessed him. The //brāhmaṇa// was then lost in ecstasy at the appearance of the object of his worship. It has also been stated that two thieves stole away the lad from his father's door with a view to purloin his jewels and gave him sweetmeats on the way. The lad exercised his illusory energy and deceived the thieves back towards his own house. The thieves, for fear of detection, left the boy there and fled. Another miraculous act that has been described is the lad's demanding and getting from Hiraṇya and Jagadīśa all the offerings they had collected for worshiping Kṛṣṇa on the day of Ekādaśī. When only four years of age he sat on rejected cooking pots which were considered unholy by his mother. He explained to his mother that there was no question of holiness and unholiness as regards earthen pots thrown away after the cooking was over. These anecdotes relate to his tender age up to the fifth year.

In his eighth year, he was admitted into the //tola// of Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita in Gaṅgānagara close by the village of Māyāpur. In two years he became well read in Sanskrit grammar and rhetoric. His readings after that were of the nature of self-study in his own house, where he had found all-important books belonging to his father, who was a //paṇḍita// himself. It appears that he read the //smṛti// in his own study, and the //nyāya// also, in competition with his friends, who were then studying under the celebrated Paṇḍita Raghunātha Śiromaṇi.

Now, after the tenth year of his age, Caitanya became a passable scholar in grammar, rhetoric, the //smṛti// and the //nyāya.// It was after this that his elder brother Viśvarūpa left his house and accepted the //āśrama// (status) of a //sannyāsī// (ascetic). Caitanya, though a very young boy, consoled his parents, saying that he would serve them with a view to please God. Just after that, his father left this world. His mother was exceedingly sorry, and Mahāprabhu, with his usual contented appearance, consoled his widowed mother.

It was at the age of 14 or 15 that Mahāprabhu was married to Lakṣmīdevī, the daughter of Vallabhācārya, also of Nadia. He was at this age considered one of the best scholars of Nadia, the renowned seat of //nyāya// philosophy and Sanskrit learning. Not to speak of the //smārta paṇḍitas,// the Naiyāyikas were all afraid of confronting him in literary discussions. Being a married man, he went to Eastern Bengal on the banks of the Padma for acquirement of wealth. There he displayed his learning and obtained a good sum of money. It was at this time that he preached Vaiṣṇavism at intervals. After teaching him the principles of Vaiṣṇavism, he ordered Tapana Miśra to go to and live in Benares. During his residence in East Bengal, his wife Lakṣmīdevī left this world from the effects of snakebite. On returning home, he found his mother in a mourning state. He consoled her with a lecture on the uncertainty of human affairs. It was at his mother's request that he married Viṣṇupriyā, the daughter of Rāja Paṇḍita Sanātana Miśra. His comrades joined him on his return from //pravāsa// or sojourn. He was now so renowned that he was considered to be the best //paṇḍita// in Nadia. Keśava Miśra of Kashmir, who had called himself the Great //Digvijayī,// came to Nadia with a view to discuss with the //paṇḍitas// of that place. Afraid of the so-called conquering //paṇḍita,// the //tola// professors of Nadia left their town on pretence of Invitation. Keśava met Mahāprabhu at the //Barokona-ghāṭā// in Māyāpur, and after a very short discussion with him he was defeated by the boy, and mortification obliged him to decamp. Nimāi Paṇḍita was now the most important //paṇḍita// of his times.

It was at the age of 16 or 17 that he traveled to Gayā with a host to sing the holy name of Hari in the streets and bazaars. This created a sensation and roused different feelings in different quarters. The //bhaktas// were highly pleased. The //smārta brāhmaṇas// became jealous of Nimāi Paṇḍita's success and complained to Chand Kazi against the character of Caitanya as un-Hindu. The Kazi came to Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita's house and broke a //mṛdaṅga// (//khola// drum) there and declared that unless Nimāi Paṇḍita ceased to make noise about his queer religion he would be obliged to enforce Mohammedanism on him and his followers. This was brought to Mahāprabhu's notice. He ordered the townspeople to appear in the evening, each with a torch in his hand. This groups, and on his arrival in the Kazi's house, he held a long conversation with the Kazi and in the end communicated into his heart his Vaiṣṇava influence by touching his body. The Kazi then wept and admitted that he had felt a keen spiritual influence which had cleared up his doubts and produced in him a religious sentiment which gave him the highest ecstasy. The Kazi then joined the //saṅkīrtana// party. The world was astonished at the spiritual power of the Great Lord, and hundreds and hundreds of heretics converted and joined the banner of Viśvambhara after this affair.

It was after this that some of the jealous and low-minded //brāhmaṇas// of Kulia picked a quarrel with Mahāprabhu and collected a party to oppose him. Nimāi Paṇḍita was naturally a soft-hearted person, though strong in his principles. He declared that party feelings and sectarianism were the two great enemies of progress and that as long as he should continue to be an inhabitant of Nadia belonging to a certain family, his mission would not meet with complete success. He then resolved to be a citizen of the world by cutting his connection with his particular family, caste and creed, and with this resolution he embraced the position of a //sannyāsī// at Katwa, under the guidance of Keśava Bhāratī of that town, on the 24th year of his age. His mother and wife wept bitterly for his separation, but our hero, though soft in heart, was a strong person in principle. He left his little world in his house for the unlimited spiritual world of Kṛṣṇa with man in general.

After his //sannyāsa,// he was induced to visit the house of Advaita Prabhu in Śāntipura. Advaita managed to invite all his friends and admirers from Nadia and brought Śacīdevī to see her son. Both pleasure and pain invaded her heart when she saw her son in the attire of a //sannyāsī.// As a //sannyāsī,// Kṛṣṇa Caitanya put on nothing but a //kaupīna// and a //bahirvāsa// (outer covering). His head was without hair, and his hands bore a //daṇḍa// (stick) and a //kamaṇḍalu// (hermit's water pot). The holy son fell at the feet of his beloved mother and said, "Mother! This body is yours, and I must obey your orders. Permit me to go to Vṛndāvana for my spiritual attainments." The mother, in consultation with Advaita and others, asked her son to reside in Purī (the town of Jagannātha) so that she might obtain his information now and then. Mahāprabhu agreed to that proposition and in a few days left Śāntipura for Orissa. His biographers have described the journey of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya (that was the name he got after his //sannyāsa//) from Śāntipura to Purī in great detail. He traveled along the side of the Bhāgīrathī as far as Chatrabhoga, situated now in Thānā Mathurāpura, Diamond Harbour, 24 Parganas. There he took a boat and went as far as Prayāga-ghāṭa in the Midnapura District. Thence he walked through Balasore and Cuttack to Purī, seeing the temple of Bhūvaneśvara on his way. Upon his arrival at Purī he saw Jagannātha in the temple and resided with Sārvabhauma at the request of the latter. Sārvabhauma was a gigantic //paṇḍita// of the day. His readings knew no bounds. He was the best //naiyāyika// of the times and was known as the most erudite scholar in the Vedānta philosophy of the school of Śaṅkarācārya. He was born in Nadia (Vidyānagara) and taught innumerable pupils in the //nyāya// philosophy in his //tola// there. He had left for Purī some time before the birth of Nimāi Paṇḍita. His brother-in-law Gopīnātha Miśra introduced our new //sannyāsī// to Sārvabhauma, who was astonished at his personal beauty and feared that it would be difficult for the young man to maintain //sannyāsa-dharma// during the long run of his life. Gopīnātha, who had known Mahāprabhu from Nadia, had a great reverence for him and declared that the //sannyāsī// was not a common human being. On this point Gopīnātha and Sārvabhauma had a hot discussion. Sārvabhauma then requested Mahāprabhu to hear his recitation of the //Vedānta-sūtras,// and the latter tacitly submitted. Caitanya heard with silence what the great Sārvabhauma uttered with gravity for seven days, at the end of which the latter said, "Kṛṣṇa Caitanya! I think you do not understand the //Vedānta,// for you do not say anything after hearing my recitation and explanations." The reply of Caitanya was that he understood the //sūtras// very well, but he could not make out what Śaṅkarācārya meant by his commentaries. Astonished at this, Sārvabhauma said, "How is it that you understand the meanings of the //sūtras// and do not understand the commentaries which explain the //sūtras?// All well! If you understand the //sūtras,// please let me have your interpretations." Mahāprabhu thereon explained all the //sūtras// in his own way without touching the pantheistic commentary of Śaṅkara. The keen understanding of Sārvabhauma saw the truth, beauty and harmony of arguments in the explanations given by Caitanya and obliged him to utter that it was the first time that he had found one who could explain the //Brahma-sūtras// in such a simple manner. He admitted also that the commentaries of Śaṅkara never gave such natural explanations of the //Vedānta-sūtras// as he had obtained from Mahāprabhu. He then submitted himself as an advocate and follower. In a few days Sārvabhauma turned out to be one of the best Vaiṣṇavas of the time. When reports of this came out, the whole of Orissa sang the praise of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, and hundreds and hundreds came to him and became his followers. In the meantime Mahāprabhu thought of visiting Southern India, and he started with one Kṛṣṇadāsa Brāhmaṇa for the journey.

His biographers have given us a detail of the journey. He went first to Kūrmakṣetra, where he performed a miracle by curing a leper named Vāsudeva. He met Rāmānanda Rāya, the Governor of Vidyānagara, on the banks of the Godāvarī and had a philosophical conversation with him on the subject of //prema-bhakti.// He worked another miracle by touching (making them immediately disappear) the seven //tāla// trees through which Rāmacandra, the son of Daśaratha, had shot his arrow and killed the great Bali Rāja. He preached Vaiṣṇavism and //nāma-saṅkīrtana// throughout the journey. At Raṅgakṣetra he stayed for four months in the house of one Veṅkata Bhaṭṭa in order to spend the rainy season. There he converted the whole family of Veṅkata from Rāmānuja Vaiṣṇavism to //Kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// along with the son of Veṅkata, a boy of ten years named Gopāla, who afterwards came to Vṛndāvana and became one of the six Gosvāmīs or prophets serving under their leader Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. Trained up in Sanskrit by his uncle Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, Gopāla wrote several books on Vaiṣṇavism.

Caitanya visited numerous places in Southern India as far as Cape Comorin and returned to Purī in two years by Pandepura on the Bhīma. In this latter place he spiritualized one Tukārāma, who became from that time a religious preacher himself. This fact has been admitted in his //ābhāṅgas,// which have been collected in a volume by Mr. Satyendra Nāth Tagore of the Bombay Civil Service. During his journey he had discussions with the Buddhists, the Jains and the Māyāvādīs in several places and converted his opponents to Vaiṣṇavism.

Upon his return to Purī, Rāja Pratāparudra-deva and several //paṇḍita brāhmaṇas// joined the banner of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was now twenty-seven years of age. In his twenty-eighth year he went to Bengal as far as Gauḍa in Malda. There he picked up two great personages named Rūpa and Sanātana. Though descended from the lines of the Karṇātic //brāhmaṇas,// these two brothers turned demi-Moslems by their continual contact with Hussain Shah, the then Emperor of Gauḍa. Their names had been changed by the Emperor into Dabira Khāsa and Sākara Mallika, and their master loved them heartily since they were both learned in Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit and were loyal servants of the state. The two gentlemen had found no way to come back as regular Hindus and had written to Mahāprabhu for spiritual help while he was at Purī. Mahāprabhu had written in reply that he would come to them and extricate them from their spiritual difficulties. Now that he had come to Gauḍa, both the brothers appeared before him with their long-standing prayer. Mahāprabhu ordered them to go to Vṛndāvana and meet him there.

Caitanya returned to Purī through Śāntipura, where he again met his dear mother. After a short stay at Purī he left for Vṛndāvana. This time he was accompanied by one Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya. He visited Vṛndāvana and came down to Prayāga (Allahabad), converting a large number of Mohammedans to Vaiṣṇavism by argument from the Koran. The descendants of those converts are still known as Pāṭhāna Vaiṣṇavas. Rūpa Gosvāmī met him at Allahabad. Caitanya trained him up in spirituality in ten days and directed him to go to Vṛndāvana on missions. His first mission was to write theological works explaining scientifically pure //bhakti// and //premā.// The second mission was to revive the places where Kṛṣṇacandra had in the end of Dvāpara-yuga exhibited His spiritual //līlā// (pastimes) for the benefit of the religious world. Rūpa Gosvāmī left Allahabad for Vṛndāvana, and Mahāprabhu came down to Benares. There he resided in the house of Candraśekhara and accepted his daily //bhikṣā// (meal) in the house of Tapana Miśra. Here it was that Sanātana Gosvāmī joined him and took instruction for two months in spiritual matters. The biographers, especially Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, have given us details of Caitanya's teachings to Rūpa and Sanātana. Kṛṣṇadāsa was not a contemporary writer, but he gathered his information from the Gosvāmīs themselves, the direct disciples of Mahāprabhu. Jīva Gosvāmī, who was nephew of Sanātana and Rūpa and who has left us his invaluable work the //Ṣaṭ-sandarbha,// has philosophized on the precepts of his great leader. We have gathered and summarized the precepts of Caitanya from the books of those great writers.

While at Benares, Caitanya had an interview with the learned //sannyāsīs// of that town in the house of a Maratha //brāhmaṇa// who had invited all the //sannyāsīs// for entertainment. At this interview, Caitanya shewed a miracle which attracted all the //sannyāsīs// to him. Then ensued reciprocal conversation. The //sannyāsīs// were headed by their most learned leader Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. After a short controversy, they submitted to Mahāprabhu and admitted that they had been misled by the commentaries of Śaṅkarācārya. It was impossible even for learned scholars to oppose Caitanya for a long time, for there was some spell in him which touched their hearts and made them weep for their spiritual improvement. The //sannyāsīs// of Benares soon fell at the feet of Caitanya and asked for his grace (//kṛpā//). Caitanya then preached pure //bhakti// and instilled into their hearts spiritual love for Kṛṣṇa which obliged them to give up sectarian feelings. The whole population of Benares, on this wonderful conversion of the //sannyāsīs,// turned Vaiṣṇavas, and they made a master //saṅkīrtana// with their new Lord. After sending Sanātana to Vṛndāvana, Mahāprabhu went to Purī again through the jungles with his comrade Balabhadra. Balabhadra reported that Mahāprabhu had shown a good many miracles on his way to Purī, such as making tigers and elephants dance on hearing the name of Kṛṣṇa.

From this time, that is, from his 31 st year, Mahāprabhu continually lived in Purī in the house of Kāśi Miśra until his disappearance in his forty-eighth year at the time of //saṅkīrtana// in the temple of Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha. During these 18 years, his life was one of settled love and piety. He was surrounded by numerous followers, all of whom were of the highest order of Vaiṣṇavas and who were distinguished from the common people by their purest character and learning, firm religious principles and spiritual love of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Svarūpa Dāmodara, who had been known by the name of Puruṣottamācārya while Mahāprabhu was in Nadia, joined him from Benares and accepted service as his secretary. No production of any poet or philosopher could be laid before Mahāprabhu unless Svarūpa had passed it as pure and useful. Rāya Rāmānanda was his second mate. Both he and Svarūpa would sing while Mahāprabhu expressed his sentiments on a certain point of worship. Paramānanda Purī was his minister in matters of religion. There are hundreds of anecdotes described by his biographers which we do not think it meet here to reproduce. Mahāprabhu slept short. His sentiments carried him far and wide in the firmament of spirituality every day and night, and all his admirers and followers watched him throughout. He worshiped, communicated with his missionaries at Vṛndāvana, and conversed with those religious men who newly came to visit him. He sang and danced, took no care of himself and oft-times lost himself in religious beatitude. All who came to him believed in him as the all-beautiful God appearing in the nether world for the benefit of mankind. He loved his mother all along and sent her //mahāprasāda// now and then with those who went to Nadia. He was most amiable in nature. Humility was personified in him. His sweet appearance gave cheer to all who came in contact with him. He appointed Prabhu Nityānanda as the missionary in charge of Bengal. He dispatched six disciples (Gosvāmīs) to Vṛndāvana to preach love in the upcountry. He punished all of his disciples who deviated from a holy life. This he markedly did in the case of Junior Haridāsa. He never lacked in giving proper instructions in life to those who solicited them. This will be seen in his teachings to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. His treatment to Haridāsa (senior) will show how he loved spiritual men and how he defied caste distinction in spiritual brotherhood.
