It is said that the import of the //Vedas// becomes clear to one who is not only a sincere devotee of the Lord but also a sincere servitor of the spiritual master. The spiritual master knows the purpose of the //Vedas,// practices it personally, and teaches the disciple of the true light of the //Vedas.// The supreme spiritual master, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, teaches us the import of the //Vedas// in the following verse of //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:16|(15.16)]]:

> dvāv imau puruṣau loke
> kṣaraś cākṣara eva ca
> kṣaraḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni
> kūṭa-stho 'kṣara ucyate

The Lord says that in the //Vedas// it is mentioned that there are two kinds of living beings, called the fallible and the infallible. Those living beings who are materially encaged are all fallible, whereas those who are not conditioned and who are eternally situated in the spiritual realm are called //akṣara,// or infallible. The Lord then says,

> uttamaḥ puruṣas tv anyaḥ
> paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ
> yo loka-trayam āviśya
> bibharty avyaya īśvaraḥ
>
> yasmāt kṣaram atīto 'ham
> akṣarād api cottamaḥ
> ato 'smi loke vede ca
> prathitaḥ puruṣottamaḥ

"Besides these innumerable fallible and infallible living beings there is another, superior personality, known as the Paramātmā. He pervades all the three worlds and exists as the supreme controller.

"And because I [Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa] am transcendental to all of them, even those who are infallible, I am known in all the //Vedas// and histories [the //Purāṇas, Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa,// etc.] as the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead." [[books:bg:15:17|(Bg. 15.17-18)]]

The import of the //Vedas// is still more explicitly explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The conclusion of the Vedic literatures is that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord and the cause of all causes. He has His eternal two-armed form as Śyāmasundara, with features exactly like those of a most beautiful young man, and that is the sum and substance of the //Vedas// concerning God. God is one, but the living entities, including both the liberated and the conditioned, are many and have many different grades of positions. The living entities are never equal to God, but as parts and parcels of the Lord they are eternally His servitors. As long as the living entities are situated normally as His servitors they are happy; otherwise they are always unhappy. That is the Vedic conclusion.
