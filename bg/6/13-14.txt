**One should hold one's body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.**

===== Purport =====

The goal of life is to know Kṛṣṇa, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Paramātmā, the four-handed Viṣṇu form. The //yoga// process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Viṣṇu, and not for any other purpose. The localized Viṣṇu-mūrti is the plenary representation of Kṛṣṇa dwelling within one's heart. One who has no program to realize this Viṣṇu-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-//yoga// practice and is certainly wasting his time. Kṛṣṇā is the ultimate goal of life, and the Viṣṇu-murti situated in one's heart is the object of //yoga// practice. To realize this Viṣṇu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called //yoga// class and thus become a //yogī.// One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yājñavalkya it is said:

> karmaṇā manasā vācā sarvāvasthāsu sarvadā
> sarvatra maithuṇa-tyāgo brahmacaryaṁ pracakṣate.

"The vow of //brahmacarya// is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind-at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places." No one can perform correct //yoga// practice through sex indulgence. //Brahmacarya// is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the //guru-kula,// or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming //brahmacārīs.// Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any //yoga,// whether it be //dhyāna, jñāna// or //bhakti.// One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called //brahmacārī.// Such a restrained householder //brahmacārī// may be accepted in the //bhakti// school, but the //jñāna// and //dhyāna// schools do not admit even householder //brahmacārīs.// They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the //bhakti// school, a householder //brahmacārī// is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of //bhakti-yoga// is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said:

> viṣayā vinivartante nirāhārasya dehinaḥ
> rasa-varjaṁ raso 'py asya paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate

Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.

//Vigatabhīḥ.// One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. The //Bhāgavatam// says, //bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād īśād apetasya viparyayo 'smṛtiḥ:// Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of //yoga// practice is to see the Lord within, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is already the best of all //yogīs.// The principles of the //yoga// system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called //yoga// societies.
