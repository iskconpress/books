===== Translation =====

**Or he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Verily, such a birth is rare in this world.**

===== Purport =====

Birth in a family of //yogīs// or transcendentalists---those with great wisdom---is praised herein because the child born in such a family receives spiritual impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case in the //ācārya// or //gosvāmī// families. Such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there are many such //ācārya// families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families. Fortunately, both our spiritual master, Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja, and our humble self, had the opportunity to take birth in such families, by the grace of the Lord, and both of us were trained in the devotional service of the Lord from the very beginning of our lives. Later on we met by the order of the transcendental system.
