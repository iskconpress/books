**For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success. That is My opinion.**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice //yoga// while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it. Similarly, //yoga// practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of //yoga// practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person easily achieves the result of //yoga// practice without separate endeavor, but a //yoga// practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious.
