===== Translation =====

**From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.**

===== Purport =====

The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized //yogī// has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called //gosvāmī,// or //svāmī,// and one who is controlled by the mind is called //godāsa,// or the servant of the senses. A //gosvāmī// knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of Hṛṣīkeśa or the supreme owner of the senses-Kṛṣṇa. Serving Kṛṣṇa with purified senses is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection of //yoga// practice.
