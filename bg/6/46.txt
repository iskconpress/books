===== Purport =====

When we speak of //yoga// we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up process is predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called //karma-yoga,// when it is predominantly empirical, it is called //jñāna-yoga,// and when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called //bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all //yogas,// as will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of //yoga,// but He has not mentioned that it is better than //bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga// is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form of //yoga// performance mentioned here is //bhakti-yoga,// and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse.
