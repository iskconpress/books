===== Purport =====

The word //bhajete// is significant here. //Bhajete// has its root in the verb //bhaj,// which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" cannot be used in the same sense as //bhaja.// Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The //Bhāgavatam// confirms this as follows:

> ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād ātma-prabhavam īśvaram
> na bhajanty avajānanti sthānād bhraṣṭā patanty adhaḥ.

"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position."

In this verse also the word //bhajanti// is used. Therefore, //bhajanti// is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word //avajānanti,// used in this verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// is also found in the //Bhagavad-gītā: avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ:// "Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Kṛṣṇa." Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the //Bhagavad-gītā// without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word //bhajanti// and the word "worship."

The culmination of all kinds of //yoga// practices lies in //bhakti-yoga.// All other //yogas// are but means to come to the point of //bhakti// in //bhakti-yoga. Yoga// actually means //bhakti-yoga;// all other //yogas// are progressions toward the destination of //bhakti-yoga.// From the beginning of //karma-yoga// to the end of //bhakti-yoga// is a long way to self-realization. //Karma-yoga,// without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When //karma-yoga// increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called //jñāna-yoga.// When //jñāna-yoga// increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called //aṣṭāṅga-yoga.// And, when one surpasses the //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, it is called //bhakti-yoga,// the culmination. Factually, //bhakti-yoga// is the ultimate goal, but to analyze //bhakti-yoga// minutely one has to understand these other //yogas.// The //yogī// who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: //karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī// or //dhyāna-yogī, rāja-yogī, haṭha-yogī,// etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of //bhakti-yoga,// it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other //yogas.// Therefore, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious is the highest stage of //yoga,// just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world's highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.

It is by great fortune that one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the path of //bhakti-yoga// to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal //yogī// concentrates his attention on Kṛṣṇa, who is called Śyāmasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the //brahmajyoti.// He incarnates in different forms such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of Mother Yaśodā, and He is known as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda and Vāsudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest //yogī.//

This stage of highest perfection in //yoga// can be attained only by //bhakti-yoga,// as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:

> yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ.

"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed."

//Bhaktir asya bhajanaṁ tadihāmutropādhi nairāsyenāmuṣmin manaḥ kalpanam; etad eva naiṣkarmyam. "Bhakti// means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of //naiṣkarmya.//"

These are some of the means for performance of //bhakti// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the //yoga// system.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the// Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā //in the matter of// Sāṅkhya-yoga Brahma-vidyā.
