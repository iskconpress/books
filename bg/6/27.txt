===== Purport =====

//Brahma-bhūta// is the state of being free from material contamination and situated in the transcendental service of the Lord. //Mad-bhaktim labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]]. One cannot remain in the quality of Brahman, the Absolute, until one's mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ.// To be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, or to remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of passion and all material contamination.
