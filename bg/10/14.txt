===== Purport =====

Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kṛṣṇa and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of //Bhagavad-gītā.// As described in the Fourth Chapter, the //paramparā// system of disciplic succession for the understanding of //Bhagavad-gītā// was lost, and therefore Kṛṣṇa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to //Gītopaniṣad, Bhagavad-gītā// should be understood in the //paramparā// system. When the //paramparā// system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kṛṣṇa says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of //Bhagavad-gītā,// and then only can we understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
