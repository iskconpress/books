**Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.**

===== Purport =====

Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by Mahā-Viṣṇu and are annihilated by Lord Śiva. Brahmā is the secondary creator. All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.

Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as the four //Vedas,// the //Vedānta-sūtra// and the //Purāṇas,// the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and the //Gītā.// These are all representatives of Kṛṣṇa. Among logicians there are different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called //japa.// The attempt to defeat one another is called //vitaṇḍa,// and the final conclusion is called //vāda.// The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Kṛṣṇa.
