**Of hymns I am the Bṛhat-sāma sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the Gāyatrī verse, sung daily by brāhmaṇas. Of months I am November and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.**

===== Purport =====

It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the //Vedas,// the //Sāma-veda// is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.

One of these songs is the //Bṛhat-sāma,// which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.

In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry, the Gāyatrī //mantra,// which is chanted by the duly qualified //brāhmaṇas,// is the most prominent. The Gāyatrī //mantra// is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Because the Gāyatrī //mantra// is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This //mantra// is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gāyatrī //mantra.// The Gāyatrī //mantra// is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahmā is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.

The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Kṛṣṇa's pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.
