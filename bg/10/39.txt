===== Translation =====

**Furthermore, O Arjuna, I am the generating seed of all existences. There is no being---moving or unmoving---that can exist without Me.**

===== Purport =====

Everything has a cause, and that cause or seed of manifestation is Kṛṣṇa. Without Kṛṣṇa's energy, nothing can exist; therefore He is called omnipotent. Without His potency, neither the movable nor the unmovable can exist. Whatever existence is not founded on the energy of Kṛṣṇa is called //māyā,// that which is not.
