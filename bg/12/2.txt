**The Blessed Lord said: He whose mind is fixed on My personal form, always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith, is considered by Me to be most perfect.**

===== Purport =====

In answer to Arjuna's question, Kṛṣṇa clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in //yoga.// For one in such Kṛṣṇa consciousness there are no material activities because everything is done by Kṛṣṇa. A pure devotee is constantly engaged-sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about Kṛṣṇa, or sometimes he cooks //prasādam// or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for Kṛṣṇa, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes-whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to Kṛṣṇa Such action is in full //samādhi.//
