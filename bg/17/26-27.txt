===== Purport =====

The words //praśaste karmaṇi,// or prescribed duties, indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes beginning from parental care up to the end of one's life. Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate //om tat sat.// The words //sad-bhāve// and //sādhu-bhāve// indicate the transcendental situation. One who is acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called //sattva,// and one who is fully conscious of activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called //svarūpa.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words //om tat sat.// Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, //om tat sat// is invoked. These words //om tat sat// are used to perfect all activities. This supreme //om tat sat// makes everything complete.
