**And charity performed at an improper place and time and given to unworthy persons without respect and with contempt is charity in the mode of ignorance.**

===== Purport =====

Contributions for indulgence in intoxication and gambling are not encouraged here. That sort of contribution is in the mode of ignorance. Such charity is not beneficial; rather, sinful persons are encouraged. Similarly, if a person gives charity to a suitable person without respect and without attention, that sort of charity is also said to be in the mode of darkness.
