===== Translation =====

**Due to the evil deeds of the destroyers of family tradition, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.**

===== Purport =====

The four orders of human society, combined with family welfare activities as they are set forth by the institution of the //sanātana-dharma// or //varṇāśrama-dharma,// are designed to enable the human being to attain his ultimate salvation. Therefore, the breaking of the //sanātana-dharma// tradition by irresponsible leaders of society brings about chaos in that society, and consequently people forget the aim of life-Viṣṇu. Such leaders are called blind, and persons who follow such leaders are sure to be led into chaos.
