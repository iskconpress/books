According to //Bhagavad-gītā,// a //sādhu// (holyman) is a man in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kṛṣṇa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a //sādhu.// And //duṣkṛtam// applies to one who doesn't care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such miscreants, or //duṣkṛtam,// are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is accepted as //sādhu,// even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlāda Mahārāja was the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, was the sister of Kaṁsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kṛṣṇa was to be born of them. So Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to deliver Devakī, rather than kill Kaṁsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.

In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:

> sṛṣṭi-hetu yei mūrti prapañce avatare
> sei īśvara-mūrti 'avatāra' nāma dhare
> māyātita paravyome savāra avasthāna
> viśve 'avatāri' dhare 'avatāra' nāma.

"The //avatāra,// or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or //avatāra.// Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name //avatāra."//

There are various kinds of //avatāras,// such as //puruṣāvatāras, guṇāvatāras, līlāvatāras, śaktyāveśa avatāras, manvantara-avatāras// and //yugāvatāras//---all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all //avatāras.// Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vṛndāvana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the Kṛṣṇa //avatāra// is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.

The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Kṛṣṇa by the //saṅkīrtana// movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of //saṅkīrtana// would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the //Upaniṣads, Mahābhārata, Bhāgavatam,// etc. The devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are much attracted by the //saṅkīrtana// movement of Lord Caitanya. This //avatāra// of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.
