===== Purport =====

The //yoga// system conceived by Patañjali is referred to herein. In the //Yoga-sūtra// of Patañjali, the soul is called //pratyag-ātmā// and //parag-ātmā.// As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called //parag-ātmā.// The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pātañjala system of //yoga// instructs one on how to control the functions of the body's air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this //yoga// system, //pratyag ātmā// is the ultimate goal. This //pratyag ātmā// is a withdrawal from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the //prāṇa-vāyu.// The //apāna-vāyu// goes downwards, //vyāna-vāyu// acts to shrink and expand, //samāna-vāyu// adjusts equilibrium, //udāna-vāyu// goes upwards-and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.
