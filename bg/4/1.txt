===== Purport =====

Herein we find the history of the //Bhagavad-gītā// traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.

In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvān, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is stated:

> yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ
> rājā samasta-sura-mūrttir aśeṣa-tejāḥ
> yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kālacakro
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"Let me worship," Lord Brahmā said, "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order."

The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasvān) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Kṛṣṇa originally made Vivasvān His first disciple to understand the science of //Bhagavad-gītā.// The //Gītā// is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial. In the //Mahābhārata (Śānti-parva// 348.51-52) we can trace out the history of the //Gītā// as follows:

> tretā-yugādau ca tato vivasvān manave dadau
> manuś ca loka-bhṛty-arthaṁ sutāyekṣvākave dadau
> ikṣvākuṇā ca kathito vyāpya lokān avasthitāḥ

"In the beginning of the Tretā-yuga [millennium] this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the King of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared. Therefore, //Bhagavad-gītā// existed in the human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku."

At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvāpara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tretā-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the //Bhagavad-gītā// to his disciple and son Mahārāja lkṣvāku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the //Gītā// was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the //Gītā// was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the //Gīta,// according to the //Gītā// itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvān because he is also a //kṣatriya// and is the father of all //kṣatriyas// who are descendants of the sun-god, or the //sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas.// Because //Bhagavad-gītā// is as good as the //Vedas,// being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is //apauruṣeya,// superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the //Gītā// must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the //Gītā// in their own ways, but that is not //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Therefore, //Bhagavad-gītā// has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.
