===== Purport =====

If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the //Vedas,// technically known as //darśa-paurṇamāsī,// which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the //pitā// planets by performing a specific //yajña.// Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a //yakṣa, rakṣa// or //piśāca. Piśāca// worship is called "black arts" or "black magic." There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaikuṇṭha and Kṛṣṇaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the //pitā// achieve the //pitā// planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the //brahmajyoti.// This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.
