===== Purport =====

Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of //yajña// performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. //Yajña// means Viṣṇu. In the Second Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying //Yajña// or Viṣṇu. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as //varṇāśrama-dharma,// is specifically meant for satisfying Viṣṇu. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says in this verse, "I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master." However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.
