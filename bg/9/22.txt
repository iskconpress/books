===== Purport =====

One who is unable to live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot but think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called //yoga.// By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. //Kṣema// refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness by //yoga,// and when he becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.
