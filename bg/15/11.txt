===== Translation =====

**The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try to.**

===== Purport =====

There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity. The word //yoginaḥ// is significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called //yogīs,// and there are many so-called associations of //yogīs,// but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called //yatanto 'py akṛtātmānaḥ.// Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called //yoga// system, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the //yoga// system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, the //bhakti-yogīs,// those engaged in pure devotional service in Krsṇa consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.
