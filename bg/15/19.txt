===== Purport =====

There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of //Bhagavad-gītā,// this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on //Bhagavad-gītā// who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.

Vedic knowledge is called //śruti// learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like Kṛṣṇa and His representatives. Here Kṛṣṇa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from //Bhagavad-gītā// that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, knows the purpose of the //Vedas;// no one else knows the purpose of the //Vedas.//

The word //bhajate// is very significant. In many places the word //bhajate// is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vaiṣṇava //paramparā// it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.
