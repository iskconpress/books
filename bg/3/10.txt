===== Purport =====

The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Viṣṇu) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home-back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.// The Lord says that the purpose of the //Vedas// is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: //patiṁ viśvasyātmeśvaram.// Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// also Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes the Lord as //pati// in so many ways:

> śriyaḥ-patir yajña-patiḥ prajā-patir
> dhiyāṁ patir loka-patir dharā-patiḥ
> patir gatiś cāndhaka-vṛṣṇi-sātvatāṁ
> prasīdatāṁ me bhagavān satāṁ patiḥ
> [[books:sb:2:4:20|(Bhāg. 2.4.20)]]

The //prajā-pati// is Lord Viṣṇu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform //yajñas// (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of //yajña,// the conditioned souls gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. //Saṅkīrtana-yajña// and Kṛṣṇa consciousness go well together. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as follows, with special reference to the //saṅkīrtana-yajña://

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇāṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ

"In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña.//" (Bhāg. 11.5.29) Other //yajñas// prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// is easy and sublime for all purposes.
