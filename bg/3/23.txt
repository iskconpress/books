===== Purport =====

In order to keep the balance of social tranquility for progress in spiritual life. there are traditional family usages meant for every civilized man. Although such rules and regulations are for the conditioned souls and not Lord Kṛṣṇa, because He descended to establish the principles of religion, He followed the prescribed rules. Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps because He is the greatest authority. From the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is understood that Lord Kṛṣṇa was performing all the religious duties at home and out of home, as required of a householder.
