===== Translation =====

**O conqueror of wealth, Arjuna, have you heard this attentively with your mind? And are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled?**

===== Purport =====

The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole //Bhagavad-gītā// in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole //Bhagavad-gītā// if so required. Actually, anyone who hears //Bhagavad-gītā// from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. //Bhagavad-gītā// is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person, if he is fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative, is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.
