===== Translation =====

**One can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by becoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments. That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.**

===== Purport =====

Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Krṣna consciousness. The person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is really a //sannyāsī,// one in the renounced order of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A //sannyāsī// is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called //yogārūḍha,// or the perfectional stage of //yoga,// as confirmed in the Third Chapter: //yas tv ātma-ratir eva syāt.// One who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.
