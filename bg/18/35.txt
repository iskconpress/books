===== Translation =====

**And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness, lamentation, moroseness, and illusion---such unintelligent determination is in the mode of darkness.**

===== Purport =====

It should not be concluded that a person in the mode of goodness does not dream. Here dream means too much sleep. Dream is always present; either in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, dream is a natural occurrence. But those who cannot avoid oversleeping, who cannot avoid the pride of enjoying material objects and who are always dreaming of lording it over the material world, whose life, mind, and senses are thus engaged, are considered to be in the mode of ignorance.
