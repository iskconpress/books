===== Translation =====

**For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.**

===== Purport =====

Generally it is advised that //Bhagavad-gītā// be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand Kṛṣṇa nor //Bhagavad-gītā.// Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is should not try to explain //Bhagavad-gītā// whimsically and become offenders. //Bhagavad-gītā// should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.
