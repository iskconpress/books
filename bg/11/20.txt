===== Purport =====

//Dyāv āpṛthivyoḥ// (the space between heaven and earth) and //lokatrayam// (three worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were spiritually awake with the divine vision saw it.
