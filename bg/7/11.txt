**I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bhāratas [Arjuna].**

===== Purport =====

The strong man's strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles (//dharma//), should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise. The responsibility of parents is then to make their offspring Kṛṣṇa conscious.
