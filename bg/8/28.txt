===== Purport =====

This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the //Vedas// under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A //brahmacārī// has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master's order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing //brahmacarya.//

After the student studies the //Vedas// under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the //Vedas// is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the //brahmacārī// is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of //vānaprastha,// he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of //brahmacārī,// householder, //vānaprastha// and finally //sannyāsa,// one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal //brahmajyoti// or in the Vaikuṇṭha planets or Kṛṣṇaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.

The beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.

One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the //Gītā// not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the //Gītā.// If one is fortunate to understand the //Gītā//---especially these middle six chapters---in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the //Gītā// from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the //Gīta// can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the //Gītā// from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service Kṛṣṇa's activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the //Gītā// becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kṛṣṇa, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee's transferral to Kṛṣṇa's abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the// Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā //in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.//
