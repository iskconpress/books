===== Purport =====

In this chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa answers these different questions of Arjuna beginning with, "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains //karma,// fruitive activities, devotional service and //yoga// principles, and devotional service in its pure form. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān. In addition, the living entity, individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about //ātmā,// which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, //ātmā// refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.

Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as //Puruṣottama,// Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers.
