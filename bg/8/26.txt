**According to the Vedas, there are two ways of passing from this world---one in light and one in darkness. When one passes in light, he does not come back; but when one passes in darkness, he returns.**

===== Purport =====

The same description of departure and return is quoted by Ācārya Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa from the //Chandogya Upaniṣad.// In such a way, those who are fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time immemorial are constantly going and coming. Actually they do not attain ultimate salvation, for they do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa.
