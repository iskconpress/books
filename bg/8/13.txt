===== Translation =====

**After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.**

===== Purport =====

It is clearly stated here that //om,// Brahman, and Lord Kṛṣṇa are not different. The impersonal sound of Kṛṣṇa is //om,// but the sound Hare Kṛṣṇa contains //om.// It is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the //mahāmantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, he will reach the spiritual planets. Similarly, those who are devotees of Kṛṣṇa enter the Kṛṣṇa planet or Goloka Vṛndāvana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the //brahmajyoti.// The personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as Vaikuṇṭhas.
