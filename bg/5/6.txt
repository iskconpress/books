**Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.**

===== Purport =====

There are two classes of //sannyāsīs,// or persons in the renounced order of life. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// are engaged in the study of //sāṅkhya// philosophy, whereas the Vaisnava //sannyāsīs// are engaged in the study of //Bhāgavatam// philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtras.// The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// also study the //Vedānta-sūtras,// but use their own commentary, called //Śārīraka-bhāṣya,// written by Śaṅkarācārya. The students of the //Bhāgavata// school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according to //pāñcarātrikī// regulations, and therefore the Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// engaged in the studies of //sāṅkhya// and //Vedānta// and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the //Bhāgavatam// without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs.// The Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are better situated than the //sannyāsīs// engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, after many births.
