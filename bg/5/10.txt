===== Purport =====

Here //brahmaṇi// means in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the //pradhāna.// The Vedic hymns, //sarvam etad brahma, tasmād etad brahma nāma-rūpam annaṁ ca jāyate,// and, in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mama yonir mahad brahma,// indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the //Īśopaniṣad// it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or Kṛṣṇa, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one's material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the //Gītā: mayi sarvāṇi karmāṇi sannyasya:// "Resign all works unto Me [Kṛṣṇa]." The conclusion is that a person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of Kṛṣṇa and should therefore be engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa.
