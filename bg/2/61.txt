===== Purport =====

That the highest conception of //yoga// perfection is Kṛṣṇa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And, unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durvāsā Muni picked a quarrel with Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, and Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a //yogī// as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage's injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānavarṇane
> karau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣu
> śrutiṁ cakārācyuta-sat-kathodaye
>
> mukunda-liṅgālaya-darśane dṛśau
> tad-bhṛtya-gātra-sparśe'ṅga-saṅgamam
> ghrāṇaṁ ca tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe
> śrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite
>
> pādau hareḥ kṣetra-padānusarpaṇe
> śiro hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandane
> kāmaṁ ca dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā
> yathottamaśloka-janāśrayā ratiḥ

"King Ambarīṣa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the //tulasī// leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become a //mat-paraḥ// devotee of the Lord." [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|(Bhāg. 9.4.18-20)]]

The word //mat-paraḥ// is most significant in this connection. How one can become a //mat-paraḥ// is described in the life of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great scholar and //ācārya// in the line of the //mat-paraḥ,// remarks: //"mad-bhakti-prabhāvena sarvendriya-vijaya-pūrvikā svātma dṛṣṭiḥ sulabheti bhāvaḥ."// "The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa." Also the example of fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Viṣṇu, situated in the heart of the //yogī,// burns up all kinds of impurities." The //Yoga-sūtra// also prescribes meditation on Viṣṇu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called //yogīs// who meditate on something which is not the Viṣṇu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be Kṛṣṇa conscious-devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real //yoga.//
