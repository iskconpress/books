===== Purport =====

As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kṛṣṇa condemns the attitude of Arjuna who said, "I do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause perpetual habitation in hell." Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a //kṣatriya// to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the //Parāśara-smṛti// or religious codes made by Parāśara, the great sage and father of Vyāsadeva, it is stated:

> kṣatriyo hi prajā rakṣan śastra-pāṇiḥ pradaṇḍayan
> nirjitya parasainyādi kṣitiṁ dharmeṇa pālayet.

"The //kṣatriya's// duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with //religious principles,// he should rule over the world."

Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.
