//Samādhi// means "fixed mind." The Vedic dictionary, the //Nirukti,// says, //samyag ādhīyate 'sminn ātmatattva-yāthātmyam:// "When the mind is fixed for understanding the self, it is called //samādhi. "Samādhi// is never possible for persons interested in material sense enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things. They are more or less condemned by the process of material energy.
