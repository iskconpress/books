====== Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes =====

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has given a summary of this chapter in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya:// "In this Fourteenth Chapter of the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// there is a description of how Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed His childhood pastimes-crawling, crying, eating dirt and giving intelligence to His mother, favoring a //brāhmaṇa// guest, riding on the shoulders of two thieves and misleading them to His own house, and, on the plea of being diseased, taking //prasāda// in the house of Hiraṇya and Jagadīśa on the Ekādaśī day. The chapter further describes how He displayed Himself as a naughty boy, how when His mother fainted He brought a coconut to her on His head, how He joked with girls of the same age on the banks of the Ganges, how He accepted worshipful paraphernalia from Śrīmatī Lakṣmīdevī, how He sat down in a garbage pit wherefrom He instructed transcendental knowledge, how He left the pit on the order of His mother, and how He dealt with His father with full affection."

  ; [[.14:1|Cc. Ādi 14.1]]
  : Things that are very difficult to do become easy to execute if one somehow or other simply remembers Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But if one does not remember Him, even easy things become very difficult. To this Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu I offer my respectful obeisances.

  ; [[.14:2|Cc. Ādi 14.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu and all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.14:3|Cc. Ādi 14.3]]
  : I have thus described in brief the advent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who appeared as the son of mother Śacī, exactly as Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of mother Yaśodā.

  ; [[.14:4|Cc. Ādi 14.4]]
  : I have already briefly spoken about the pastimes of His birth in chronological order. Now I shall give a synopsis of His childhood pastimes.

  ; [[.14:5|Cc. Ādi 14.5]]
  : Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the childhood pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Although such pastimes appear exactly like those of an ordinary child, they should be understood as various pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.14:6|Cc. Ādi 14.6]]
  : In His first childhood pastimes the Lord turned upside down while lying on His bed, and thus He showed His parents the marks of His lotus feet.

  ; [[.14:7|Cc. Ādi 14.7]]
  : When the Lord tried to walk, in His small footprints the specific marks of Lord Viṣṇu were visible, namely, the flag, thunderbolt, conchshell, disc and fish.

  ; [[.14:8|Cc. Ādi 14.8]]
  : Seeing all these marks, neither His father nor His mother could understand whose footprints they were. Thus struck with wonder, they could not understand how those marks could be possible in their home.

  ; [[.14:9|Cc. Ādi 14.9]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra said, "Certainly child Kṛṣṇa is with the śālagrāma-śilā. Taking His childhood form, He is playing within the room."

  ; [[.14:10|Cc. Ādi 14.10]]
  : While mother Śacī and Jagannātha Miśra were talking, the child Nimāi woke up and began to cry, and mother Śacī took Him on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast.

  ; [[.14:11|Cc. Ādi 14.11]]
  : While mother Śacī was feeding the child from her breast, she saw on His lotus feet all the marks that were visible on the floor of the room, and she called for Jagannātha Miśra.

  ; [[.14:12|Cc. Ādi 14.12]]
  : When Jagannātha Miśra saw the wonderful marks on the sole of his son, he became very joyful and privately called for Nīlāmbara Cakravartī.

  ; [[.14:13|Cc. Ādi 14.13]]
  : When Nīlāmbara Cakravartī saw those marks, he smilingly said, "Formerly I ascertained all this by astrological calculation and noted it in writing.

  ; [[.14:14|Cc. Ādi 14.14]]
  : "There are thirty-two bodily marks that symptomize a great personality, and I see all those marks on the body of this child.

  ; [[.14:15|Cc. Ādi 14.15]]
  : " 'There are thirty-two bodily symptoms of a great personality: five of his bodily parts are large, five fine, seven reddish, six raised, three small, three broad and three grave.'

  ; [[.14:16|Cc. Ādi 14.16]]
  : "This baby has all the symptoms of Lord Nārāyaṇa on His palms and soles. He will be able to deliver all the three worlds.

  ; [[.14:17|Cc. Ādi 14.17]]
  : "This child will preach the Vaiṣṇava cult and deliver both His maternal and paternal families.

  ; [[.14:18|Cc. Ādi 14.18]]
  : "I propose to perform a name-giving ceremony. We should observe a festival and call for the brāhmaṇas because today is very auspicious.

  ; [[.14:19|Cc. Ādi 14.19]]
  : "In the future this child will protect and maintain all the world. For this reason He is to be called Viśvambhara."

  ; [[.14:20|Cc. Ādi 14.20]]
  : After hearing Nīlāmbara Cakravartī's prediction, Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra observed the name-giving festival in great joy, inviting all the brāhmaṇas and their wives.

  ; [[.14:21|Cc. Ādi 14.21]]
  : After some days the Lord began to crawl on His knees, and He caused various wonderful things to be seen.

  ; [[.14:22|Cc. Ādi 14.22]]
  : The Lord caused all the ladies to chant the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra on the plea of His crying, and while they chanted the Lord would smile.

  ; [[.14:23|Cc. Ādi 14.23]]
  : After some days the Lord began to move His legs and walk. He mixed with other children and exhibited various sports.

  ; [[.14:24|Cc. Ādi 14.24]]
  : One day while the Lord was enjoying His playful sports with the other little children, mother Śacī brought a dish filled with fused rice and sweetmeats and asked the child to sit down and eat them.

  ; [[.14:25|Cc. Ādi 14.25]]
  : But when she returned to her household duties, the child hid from His mother and began to eat dirt.

  ; [[.14:26|Cc. Ādi 14.26]]
  : Seeing this, mother Śacī hastily returned and exclaimed, "What is this! What is this!" She snatched the dirt from the hands of the Lord and inquired why He was eating it.

  ; [[.14:27|Cc. Ādi 14.27]]
  : Crying, the child inquired from His mother, "Why are you angry? You have already given Me dirt to eat. What is My fault?

  ; [[.14:28|Cc. Ādi 14.28]]
  : "Fused rice, sweetmeats and all other eatables are but transformations of dirt. This is dirt, that is dirt. Please consider. What is the difference between them?

  ; [[.14:29|Cc. Ādi 14.29]]
  : "This body is a transformation of dirt, and the eatables are also a transformation of dirt. Please reflect upon this. You are blaming Me without consideration. What can I say?"

  ; [[.14:30|Cc. Ādi 14.30]]
  : Astonished that the child was speaking Māyāvāda philosophy, mother Śacī replied, "Who has taught You this philosophical speculation that justifies eating dirt?"

  ; [[.14:31|Cc. Ādi 14.31]]
  : Replying to the Māyāvāda idea of the child philosopher, mother Śacī said, "My dear boy, if we eat earth transformed into grains, our body is nourished, and it becomes strong. But if we eat dirt in its crude state, the body becomes diseased instead of nourished, and thus it is destroyed.

  ; [[.14:32|Cc. Ādi 14.32]]
  : "In a waterpot, which is a transformation of dirt, I can bring water very easily. But if I poured water on a lump of dirt, the lump would soak up the water, and my labor would be useless."

  ; [[.14:33|Cc. Ādi 14.33]]
  : The Lord replied to His mother, "Why did you conceal self-realization by not teaching Me this practical philosophy in the beginning?

  ; [[.14:34|Cc. Ādi 14.34]]
  : "Now that I can understand this philosophy, no more shall I eat dirt. Whenever I am hungry I shall suck your breast and drink your breast's milk."

  ; [[.14:35|Cc. Ādi 14.35]]
  : After saying this, the Lord, smiling slightly, climbed on the lap of His mother and sucked her breast.

  ; [[.14:36|Cc. Ādi 14.36]]
  : Thus under various excuses the Lord exhibited His opulences as much as possible in His childhood, and later, after exhibiting such opulences, He hid Himself.

  ; [[.14:37|Cc. Ādi 14.37]]
  : On one occasion the Lord ate the food of a brāhmaṇa guest three times, and later, in confidence, the Lord delivered that brāhmaṇa from material engagement.

  ; [[.14:38|Cc. Ādi 14.38]]
  : In His childhood the Lord was taken away by two thieves outside His home. The Lord, however, got up on the shoulders of the thieves, and while they were thinking they were safely carrying the child to rob His ornaments, the Lord misled them, and thus instead of going to their own home the thieves came back to the home of Jagannātha Miśra.

  ; [[.14:39|Cc. Ādi 14.39]]
  : Pretending to be sick, the Lord asked some food from the house of Hiraṇya and Jagadīśa on the Ekādaśī day.

  ; [[.14:40|Cc. Ādi 14.40]]
  : As usual for small children, He learned to play, and with His playmates He went to the houses of neighboring friends, stealing their eatables and eating them. Sometimes the children fought among themselves.

  ; [[.14:41|Cc. Ādi 14.41]]
  : All the children lodged complaints with Śacīmātā about the Lord's fighting with them and stealing from the neighbors' houses. Therefore sometimes she used to chastise or rebuke her son.

  ; [[.14:42|Cc. Ādi 14.42]]
  : Śacīmātā said, "Why do You steal others' things? Why do You beat the other children? And why do You go inside others' houses? What do You not have in Your own house?"

  ; [[.14:43|Cc. Ādi 14.43]]
  : Thus rebuked by His mother, he Lord would go in anger to a room and break all the pots within it.

  ; [[.14:44|Cc. Ādi 14.44]]
  : Then Śacīmātā would take her son on her lap and pacify Him, and the Lord would be very much ashamed, admitting His own faults.

  ; [[.14:45|Cc. Ādi 14.45]]
  : Once the child, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, chastised His mother with His soft hand, and His mother pretended to faint. Seeing this, the Lord began to cry.

  ; [[.14:46|Cc. Ādi 14.46]]
  : The neighboring ladies told Him, "Dear child, please bring a coconut from somewhere, and then Your mother will be cured."

  ; [[.14:47|Cc. Ādi 14.47]]
  : He then immediately went outside the house and brought two coconuts. All the ladies were astonished to see such wonderful activities.

  ; [[.14:48|Cc. Ādi 14.48]]
  : Sometimes the Lord would go with other children to bathe in the Ganges, and the neighboring girls would also come there to worship various demigods.

  ; [[.14:49|Cc. Ādi 14.49]]
  : When the girls engaged in worshiping the different demigods after bathing in the Ganges, the young Lord would come there and sit down among them.

  ; [[.14:50|Cc. Ādi 14.50]]
  : Addressing the girls, the Lord would say, "Worship Me, and I shall give you good husbands or good benedictions. The Ganges and Goddess Durgā are My maidservants. What to speak of other demigods, even Lord Śiva is My servant."

  ; [[.14:51|Cc. Ādi 14.51]]
  : Without the permission of the girls, the Lord would take the sandalwood pulp and smear it on His own body, put the flower garlands on His neck, and snatch and eat all the offerings of sweetmeats, rice and bananas.

  ; [[.14:52|Cc. Ādi 14.52]]
  : All the girls became very angry at the Lord for this behavior. "Dear Nimāi," they told Him, "You are just like our brother in our village relationship.

  ; [[.14:53|Cc. Ādi 14.53]]
  : "Therefore it does not behoove You to act like this. Don't take our paraphernalia for worship of the demigods. Don't create a disturbance in this way."

  ; [[.14:54|Cc. Ādi 14.54]]
  : The Lord replied, "My dear sisters, I give you the benediction that your husbands will be very handsome.

  ; [[.14:55|Cc. Ādi 14.55]]
  : "They will be learned, clever and young and possess abundant wealth and rice. Not only that, but you will each have seven sons, who will all live long lives and be very intelligent."

  ; [[.14:56|Cc. Ādi 14.56]]
  : Hearing this benediction from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the girls were inwardly very happy, but externally, as is natural for girls, they rebuked the Lord under the pretense of anger.

  ; [[.14:57|Cc. Ādi 14.57]]
  : When some of the girls fled, the Lord called them in anger and advised them as follows:

  ; [[.14:58|Cc. Ādi 14.58]]
  : "If you are miserly and do not give Me the offerings, every one of you will have an old husband with at least four co-wives."

  ; [[.14:59|Cc. Ādi 14.59]]
  : Hearing this supposed curse by Lord Caitanya, the girls, considering that He might know something uncommon or be empowered by demigods, were afraid that His curse might be effective.

  ; [[.14:60|Cc. Ādi 14.60]]
  : The girls then brought the offerings before the Lord, who ate them all and blessed the girls to their satisfaction.

  ; [[.14:61|Cc. Ādi 14.61]]
  : When this cunning behavior of the Lord with the girls became known to the people in general, it did not create misunderstandings among them. Rather, they enjoyed happiness in these dealings.

  ; [[.14:62|Cc. Ādi 14.62]]
  : One day a girl of the name Lakṣmī, the daughter of Vallabhācārya, came to the bank of the Ganges to take bath in the river and worship the demigods.

  ; [[.14:63|Cc. Ādi 14.63]]
  : Seeing Lakṣmīdevī, the Lord became attached to her, and Lakṣmī, upon seeing the Lord, felt great satisfaction within her mind.

  ; [[.14:64|Cc. Ādi 14.64]]
  : Their natural love for one another awakened, and although it was covered by childhood emotions, it became apparent that they were mutually attracted.

  ; [[.14:65|Cc. Ādi 14.65]]
  : They both enjoyed natural pleasure in seeing each nother, and under the pretext of demigod worship they manifested their feelings.

  ; [[.14:66|Cc. Ādi 14.66]]
  : The Lord told Lakṣmī, "Just worship Me, for I am the Supreme Lord. If you worship Me, certainly you will get the benediction you desire."

  ; [[.14:67|Cc. Ādi 14.67]]
  : On hearing the order of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lakṣmī immediately worshiped Him, offering sandalwood pulp and flowers for His body, garlanding Him with mallikā flowers, and offering prayers.

  ; [[.14:68|Cc. Ādi 14.68]]
  : Being worshiped by Lakṣmī, the Lord began to smile. He recited a verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and thus accepted the emotion she expressed.

  ; [[.14:69|Cc. Ādi 14.69]]
  : "My dear gopīs, I accept your desire to have Me as your husband and thus worship Me. I wish your desire to be fulfilled because it deserves to be so."

  ; [[.14:70|Cc. Ādi 14.70]]
  : After thus expressing their feelings to each other, Lord Caitanya and Lakṣmī returned home. Who can understand the grave pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu?

  ; [[.14:71|Cc. Ādi 14.71]]
  : When the neighboring people saw the naughty behavior of Lord Caitanya, out of love for Him they lodged complaints with Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra.

  ; [[.14:72|Cc. Ādi 14.72]]
  : One day mother Śacī went to catch her son, wanting to rebuke Him, but He fled from the spot.

  ; [[.14:73|Cc. Ādi 14.73]]
  : Although He is the maintainer of the entire universe, once the Lord sat upon some rejected pots in the pit where the remnants of food were thrown, after the pots had been used for cooking.

  ; [[.14:74|Cc. Ādi 14.74]]
  : When mother Śacī saw her boy sitting on the rejected pots, she protested, "Why have You touched these untouchable pots? You have now become impure. Go and bathe in the Ganges."

  ; [[.14:75|Cc. Ādi 14.75]]
  : Hearing this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His mother about absolute knowledge. Although amazed by this, His mother forced Him to take a bath.

  ; [[.14:76|Cc. Ādi 14.76]]
  : Sometimes, taking her son with her, mother Śacī would lie down on her bed, and she would see that denizens of the celestial world had come there, filling the entire house.

  ; [[.14:77|Cc. Ādi 14.77]]
  : Once mother Śacī told the Lord, "Please go call Your father." Receiving this order from His mother, the Lord went out to call him.

  ; [[.14:78|Cc. Ādi 14.78]]
  : When the child was going out, there was a tinkling of ankle bells from His lotus feet. Hearing this, His father and mother were struck with wonder.

  ; [[.14:79|Cc. Ādi 14.79]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra said, "This is a very wonderful incident. Why is there a sound of ankle bells from the bare feet of my child?"

  ; [[.14:80|Cc. Ādi 14.80]]
  : Mother Śacī said, "I also saw another wonder. People were coming down from the celestial kingdom and crowding the entire courtyard.

  ; [[.14:81|Cc. Ādi 14.81]]
  : "They made noisy sounds I could not understand. I guess they were offering prayers to someone."

  ; [[.14:82|Cc. Ādi 14.82]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra replied, "Never mind what it is. There is no need to worry. Let there always be good fortune for Viśvambhara. This is all I want."

  ; [[.14:83|Cc. Ādi 14.83]]
  : On another occasion, Jagannātha Miśra, seeing the mischievous acts of his son, gave Him lessons in morality after rebuking Him greatly.

  ; [[.14:84|Cc. Ādi 14.84]]
  : On that very night, Jagannātha Miśra dreamt that a brāhmaṇa had come before him speaking these words in great anger:

  ; [[.14:85|Cc. Ādi 14.85]]
  : "My dear Miśra, you do not know anything about your son. You think Him your son, and therefore you rebuke and chastise Him."

  ; [[.14:86|Cc. Ādi 14.86]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra replied, "This boy may be a demigod, a mystic yogī or a great saintly person. It doesn't matter what He is, for I think He is only my son.

  ; [[.14:87|Cc. Ādi 14.87]]
  : "It is the duty of a father to educate his son in both religion and morality. If I do not give Him this education, how will He know of it?"

  ; [[.14:88|Cc. Ādi 14.88]]
  : The brāhmaṇa replied, "If your son is a transcendental mystic boy with self-effulgent perfect knowledge, what is the use of your education?"

  ; [[.14:89|Cc. Ādi 14.89]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra replied, "Even if my son is not a common man but Nārāyaṇa, still it is the duty of a father to instruct his son."

  ; [[.14:90|Cc. Ādi 14.90]]
  : In this way Jagannātha Miśra and the brāhmaṇa discussed the principles of religion in the dream, yet Jagannātha Miśra was absorbed in unalloyed parental mellow and did not want to know anything else.

  ; [[.14:91|Cc. Ādi 14.91]]
  : Being very much pleased, the brāhmaṇa left after talking with Jagannātha Miśra, and when Jagannātha Miśra awakened from his dream, he was very much astonished.

  ; [[.14:92|Cc. Ādi 14.92]]
  : He related the dream to his friends and relatives, and every one of them was very much astonished to hear of it.

  ; [[.14:93|Cc. Ādi 14.93]]
  : In this way Gaurahari performed His childhood pastimes and day after day increased the pleasure of His parents.

  ; [[.14:94|Cc. Ādi 14.94]]
  : After some days Jagannātha Miśra inaugurated the primary education of his son by performing the hāte khaḍi ceremony. Within a very few days the Lord learned all the letters and combinations of letters.

  ; [[.14:95|Cc. Ādi 14.95]]
  : This is a synopsis of the childhood pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, placed herewith in chronological order. Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has already elaborately explained these pastimes in his book Caitanya-bhāgavata.

  ; [[.14:96|Cc. Ādi 14.96]]
  : I have therefore made only a brief summary. Being afraid of repetition, I have not elaborated upon this subject matter.

  ; [[.14:97|Cc. Ādi 14.97]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
