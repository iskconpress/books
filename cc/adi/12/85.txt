The //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verses 196 and 207, mentions that Hari Ācārya was formerly the //gopī// named Kālākṣī. Sādipuriyā Gopāla is celebrated as a preacher of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in Vikramapura, in East Bengal. Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī was formerly among the group of //sakhīs// known as the //aṣṭa-sakhīs.// His name was Indulekhā. Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī lived in Vṛndāvana. There is a tomb in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple known as Kṛṣṇadāsa's tomb. Some say that this is the tomb of Kṛṣṇadāsa Brahmacārī and others Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. In either case we offer our respects because both of them were expert in distributing love of Godhead to the fallen souls of this age. The //Śākhā-nirṇaya// mentions that Puṣpagopāla was formerly known as Svarṇagrāmaka.
