**Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Kamalākānta, "You are a bāuliyā, one who does not know things as they are. Why do you act in this way? Why do you invade the privacy of Advaita Ācārya and damage His religious principles?**

===== Purport =====

Kamalākānta Viśvāsa, out of his ignorance, asked the King of Jagannātha Purī, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, to liquidate the three-hundred-rupee debt of Advaita Ācārya, but at the same time he established Advaita Ācārya as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is contradictory. An incarnation of the Supreme Godhead cannot be indebted to anyone in this material world. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is never satisfied by such a contradiction, which is technically called //rasābhāsa,// or overlapping of one humor (//rasa//) with another. This is the same type of idea as the contradiction that Nārāyaṇa is poverty-stricken (//daridra-nārāyaṇa//).
