In his //Anubhāṣya// Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda says that Bhāgavata Ācārya was formerly among the followers of Advaita Ācārya but was later counted among the followers of Gadādhara Paṇḍita. The sixth verse of //Śākhā-nirṇayāmṛta,// a book written by Yadunandana dāsa, states that Bhāgavata Ācārya compiled a famous book of the name //Prema-taraṅgiṇī.// According to the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 195, Bhāgavata Ācārya formerly lived in Vṛndāvana as Śveta-mañjarī. Viṣṇudāsa Ācārya was present during the Khetari-mahotsava. He went there with Acyutānanda, as stated in the //Bhakti-ratnākara,// Tenth //Taraṅga.// Ananta Ācārya was one of the eight principal //gopīs.// His former name was Sudevī. Although he was among Advaita Ācārya's followers, he later became an important devotee of Gadādhara Gosvāmī.
