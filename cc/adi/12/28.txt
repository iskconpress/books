===== Purport =====

The name Kamalānanda mentioned in the //Ādi-līlā// [[books:cc:adi:10:149|(10.149)]] and the name Kamalākānta mentioned in the //Madhya-līlā// [[books:cc:madhya:10:94|(10.94)]] both refer to the same man. Kamalākānta, a very confidential servant of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, engaged in the service of Śrī Advaita Ācārya as His secretary. When Paramānanda Purī went from Navadvīpa to Jagannātha Purī, he took Kamalākānta Viśvāsa with him, and they both went to see Lord Caitanya at Jagannātha Purī. It is mentioned in the //Madhya-līlā// [[books:cc:madhya:10:94|(10.94)]] that one of the devotees of Lord Caitanya, the //brāhmaṇa// Kamalākānta, went with Paramānanda Purī to Jagannātha Purī.
