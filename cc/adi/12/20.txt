===== Purport =====

The Guṇḍicā-mandira is situated in Jagannātha Purī, and every year Jagannātha, Balabhadra and Subhadrā come there from the Jagannātha temple to stay for eight days. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived at Jagannātha Purī, every year He personally cleansed this temple with His principal devotees. The //Guṇḍicā-mārjana// chapter of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:12|(Madhya 12)]] describes this vividly.
