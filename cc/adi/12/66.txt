The branches of Advaita Ācārya nourished by the water (//jala//) supplied by Sri Caitanya Mahāprabhu are to be considered bona fide //ācāryas.// As we have discussed hereinbefore, the representatives of Advaita Ācārya later divided into two groups---the bona fide branches of the //ācārya's// disciplic succession and the pretentious branches of Advaita Ācārya. Those who followed the principles of Caitanya Mahāprabhu flourished, whereas the others, who are mentioned below in the sixty-seventh verse, dried up.
