**The Lord ordered Govinda, "From today on, do not allow that bāuliyā Kamalākānta Viśvāsa to come here."**

===== Purport =====

The //bāuliyās,// or //bāulas,// are one of thirteen unauthorized sects that pass as followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord ordered Govinda, His personal assistant, not to allow Kamalākānta Viśvāsa to come in His presence because he had become a //bāuliyā.// Thus although the //bāula-sampradāya, āula-sampradāya// and //sahajiyā-sampradāya,// as well as the //smārtas, jāta-gosāñis, atibāḍis, cūḍādhārīs// and //gaurāṅga-nāgarīs,// claim to belong to the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord actually rejected them.
