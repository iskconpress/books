Śrī Mukunda, a great friend and associate of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, used to visit many places where people were against the Vaiṣṇava cult. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to know of this, He punished Mukunda, forbidding him to see Him again. Although Caitanya Mahāprabhu was soft like a flower, He was also strict like a thunderbolt, and everyone was afraid to allow Mukunda to come again into the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mukunda, therefore, being very sorry, asked his other friends whether he would one day be allowed to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When the devotees brought this inquiry to Lord Caitanya, the Lord replied, "Mukunda will get permission to see Me after many millions of years." When they gave this information to Mukunda, he danced with jubilation, and when Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard that Mukunda was so patiently waiting to meet Him after millions of years, He immediately asked him to return. There is a statement about this punishment of Mukunda in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-līlā,// Tenth Chapter.
