This is a reference to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's former punishment of Advaita Ācārya. When Advaita Ācārya Prabhu was reading //Yoga-vāśiṣṭha,// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu beat Him, but He never told Him not to come in His presence. But Kamalākānta was punished with the order never to come in the Lord's presence. Therefore Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu wanted to impress upon Caitanya Mahāprabhu that He had shown more favor to Kamalākānta Viśvāsa because He had prohibited Kamalākānta from seeing Him, whereas He had not done so to Advaita Ācārya. Therefore the favor shown Kamalākānta Viśvāsa was greater than that shown Advaita Ācārya.
