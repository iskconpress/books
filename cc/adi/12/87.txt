Śrī Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava was a resident of the village Ṭiṭakaṇā in the district of Murśidābāda. His forefathers were //śāktas// who worshiped the goddess Kirīṭeśvarī. It is said that Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava, formerly a staunch //brahmacārī,// left home and later married the daughter of his disciple Prāṇanātha Adhikārī in the village of Mayanāḍāla. The descendants of this family are known as the Ṭhākuras of Kāṅdaḍā, which is a village in the district of Burdwan near Katwa. Scattered descendants of Maṅgala Vaiṣṇava, thirty-six families altogether, still live there. Among the celebrated disciples of Maṅgala Ṭhākura are Prāṇanātha Adhikārī, Puruṣottama Cakravartī of the village of Kāṅdaḍā, and Nṛsiṁha-prasāda Mitra, whose family members are well-known //mṛdaṅga// players. Sudhākṛṣṇa Mitra and Nikuñjavihārī Mitra are both especially famous //mṛdaṅga// players. In the family of Puruṣottama Cakravartī there are famous persons like Kuñjavihārī Cakravartī and Rādhāvallabha Cakravartī, who now live in the district of Birbhum. They professionally recite songs from //Caitanya-maṅgala.// It is said that when Maṅgala Ṭhākura was constructing a road from Bengal to Jagannātha Purī, he found a Deity of Rādhāvallabha while digging a lake. At that time he was living in the locality of Kāṅdaḍā in the village named Rāṇīpura. The //śālagrāma-śilā// personally worshiped by Maṅgala Ṭhākura still exists in the village of Kāṅdaḍā. A temple has been constructed there for the worship of Vṛndāvana-candra. Maṅgala Ṭhākura had three sons-Rādhikāprasāda, Gopīramaṇa and Śyāmakiśora. The descendants of these three sons are still living.
