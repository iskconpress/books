Verses 197 and 207 of the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// describe Kavi Datta as the //gopī// named Kalakaṇṭhī, verses 196 and 207 describe Nayana Miśra as the //gopī// named Nitya-mañjarī, and verses 196 and 205 describe Gaṅgāmantrī as the //gopī// named Candrikā. Māmu Ṭhākura, whose real name was Jagannātha Cakravartī, was the nephew of Śrī Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's grandfather. In Bengal a maternal uncle is called //māmā,// and in East Bengal and Orissa, //māmu.// Thus Jagannātha Cakravartī was known as Māmā or Māmu Ṭhākura. Māmu Ṭhākura's residence was in the district of Faridpur in the village known as Magaḍobā. After the demise of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita, Māmu Ṭhākura became the priest in charge of the temple known as Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha in Jagannātha Purī. According to the opinion of some Vaiṣṇavas, Māmu Ṭhākura was formerly known as Śrī Rūpa-mañjarī. The followers of Māmu Ṭhākura were Raghunātha Gosvāmī, Rāmacandra, Rādhāvallabha, Kṛṣṇajīvana, Śyāmasundara, Śāntāmaṇi, Harinātha, Navīnacandra, Matilāla, Dayāmayī and Kuñjavihārī.

Kaṇṭhābharaṇa, whose original name was Śrī Ananta Caṭṭarāja, was the //gopī// named Gopālī in //kṛṣṇa-līlā.//
