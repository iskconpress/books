===== Purport =====

Mother Śacīdevī was similarly punished, as mentioned in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Twenty-two. Mother Śacīdevī, apparently showing her feminine nature, accused Advaita Prabhu of encouraging her son to become a //sannyāsī.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, taking this accusation as an offense, asked Śacīdevī to touch the lotus feet of Advaita Ācārya to mitigate the offense she had supposedly committed.
