The Sanskrit book //Advaita-carita// states that Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa were the fourth, fifth and sixth sons of Advaita Ācārya. Therefore Śrī Advaita Ācārya had six sons. Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa, being //smārtas,// or Māyāvādīs, were rejected by Vaiṣṇava society. Sometimes Māyāvādīs pose themselves as Vaiṣṇavas, or worshipers of Lord Viṣṇu, but actually they do not believe in Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for they consider demigods like Lord Śiva, Durgā, the sun-god and Gaṇeśa equal to Him. They are generally known as //pañcopāsaka-smārtas,// and one should not count them among the Vaiṣṇavas.

Balarāma had three wives and nine sons. The youngest son of his first wife was known as Madhusūdana Gosvāmī. He took the title Bhaṭṭācārya and accepted the path of the //smārta// or Māyāvāda philosophy. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura notes that the son of Gosvāmī Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Rādhāramaṇa Gosvāmī Bhaṭṭācārya, refused the title //gosvāmī// because it is generally meant for //sannyāsīs,// those who have taken the renounced order of life. One who is still in family life should not misuse the title //gosvāmī.// Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura did not recognize the caste //gosvāmīs// because they were not in the line of the six Gosvāmīs in the renounced order who were direct disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu-namely, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrīla Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha Gosvāmī, Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura said that the //gṛhastha āśrama,// or the status of family life, is a sort of concession for sense gratification. Therefore a //gṛhastha// should not falsely adopt the title //gosvāmī.// The ISKCON movement has never conferred the title //gosvāmī// upon a householder. Although all the //sannyāsīs// we have initiated in ISKCON are young, we have awarded them the titles of the renounced order of life, //svāmī// and //gosvāmī,// because they have completely dedicated their lives to preach the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that not only do the householder caste //gosvāmīs// disrespect the title //gosvāmī,// but also, following the principles of the //smārta// Raghunandana, they exhibit great foolishness by burning a straw image of Advaita Ācārya in a //śrāddha// ceremony, thus acting as Rākṣasas and disrespecting the cause of //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// which is the guide for Vaiṣṇavas. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that sometimes these //smārta// caste //gosvāmīs// write books on Vaiṣṇava philosophy or commentaries on the original scriptures, but a pure devotee should cautiously avoid reading them.
