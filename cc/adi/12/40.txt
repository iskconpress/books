===== Purport =====

There is a book of the name //Yoga-vāśiṣṭha// that Māyāvādīs greatly favor because it is full of impersonal misunderstandings regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with no touch of Vaiṣṇavism. Factually, all Vaiṣṇavas should avoid such a book, but Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, wanting punishment from the Lord, began to support the impersonal statements of the //Yoga-vāśiṣṭha.// Thus Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu became extremely angry at Him and seemingly treated Him disrespectfully.
