~~Title:Cc. Ādi 7: Lord Caitanya in Five Features~~

====== Lord Caitanya in Five Features =====

  ; [[.7:1|Cc. Ādi 7.1]]
  : Let me first offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the ultimate goal of life for one bereft of all possessions in this material world and is the only meaning for one advancing in spiritual life. Thus let me write about His magnanimous contribution of devotional service in love of God.

  ; [[.7:2|Cc. Ādi 7.2]]
  : Let me offer glorification to the Supreme Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who has taken shelter of His lotus feet is the most glorified person.

  ; [[.7:3|Cc. Ādi 7.3]]
  : In the beginning I have discussed the truth about the spiritual master. Now I shall try to explain the Pañca-tattva.

  ; [[.7:4|Cc. Ādi 7.4]]
  : These five tattvas incarnate with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and thus the Lord executes His saṅkīrtana movement with great pleasure.

  ; [[.7:5|Cc. Ādi 7.5]]
  : Spiritually there are no differences between these five tattvas, for on the transcendental platform everything is absolute. Yet there are also varieties in the spiritual world, and in order to taste these spiritual varieties one should distinguish between them.

  ; [[.7:6|Cc. Ādi 7.6]]
  : Let me offer my obeisances unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who has manifested Himself in five as a devotee, expansion of a devotee, incarnation of a devotee, pure devotee and devotional energy.

  ; [[.7:7|Cc. Ādi 7.7]]
  : Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all pleasure, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, the supreme controller. No one is greater than or equal to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, yet He appears as the son of Mahārāja Nanda.

  ; [[.7:8|Cc. Ādi 7.8]]
  : Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme enjoyer in the rāsa dance. He is the leader of the damsels of Vraja, and all others are simply His associates.

  ; [[.7:9|Cc. Ādi 7.9]]
  : The selfsame Lord Kṛṣṇa advented Himself as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with all His eternal associates, who are also equally glorious.

  ; [[.7:10|Cc. Ādi 7.10]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the supreme controller, the one Personality of Godhead, has ecstatically become a devotee, yet His body is transcendental and not materially tinged.

  ; [[.7:11|Cc. Ādi 7.11]]
  : The transcendental mellow of conjugal love of Kṛṣṇa is so wonderful that Kṛṣṇa Himself accepts the form of a devotee to relish and taste it fully.

  ; [[.7:12|Cc. Ādi 7.12]]
  : For this reason Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the supreme teacher, accepts the form of a devotee and accepts Lord Nityānanda as His elder brother.

  ; [[.7:13|Cc. Ādi 7.13]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya is Lord Caitanya's incarnation as a devotee. Therefore these three tattvas [Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Gosāñi] are the predominators, or masters.

  ; [[.7:14|Cc. Ādi 7.14]]
  : One of Them is Mahāprabhu, and the other two are prabhus. These two prabhus serve the lotus feet of Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.7:15|Cc. Ādi 7.15]]
  : The three predominators [Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu] are worshipable by all living entities, and the fourth principle [Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu] is to be understood as Their worshiper.

  ; [[.7:16|Cc. Ādi 7.16]]
  : There are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, who are known as unalloyed devotees.

  ; [[.7:17|Cc. Ādi 7.17]]
  : The devotees headed by Gadādhara Paṇḍita are to be considered incarnations of the internal potency of the Lord. They are confidential devotees engaged in the service of the Lord.

  ; [[.7:18-19|Cc. Ādi 7.18-19]]
  : The internal devotees or potencies are all eternal associates in the pastimes of the Lord. Only with them does the Lord advent to propound the saṅkīrtana movement, only with them does the Lord taste the mellow of conjugal love, and only with them does He distribute this love of God to people in general.

  ; [[.7:20-21|Cc. Ādi 7.20-21]]
  : The characteristics of Kṛṣṇa are understood to be a storehouse of transcendental love. Although that storehouse of love certainly came with Kṛṣṇa when He was present, it was sealed. But when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came with His other associates of the Pañca-tattva, they broke the seal and plundered the storehouse to taste transcendental love of Kṛṣṇa. The more they tasted it, the more their thirst for it grew.

  ; [[.7:22|Cc. Ādi 7.22]]
  : Śrī Pañca-tattva themselves danced again and again and thus made it easier to drink nectarean love of Godhead. They danced, cried, laughed and chanted like madmen, and in this way they distributed love of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:23|Cc. Ādi 7.23]]
  : In distributing love of Godhead, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates did not consider who was a fit candidate and who was not, nor where such distribution should or should not take place. They made no conditions. Wherever they got the opportunity the members of the Pañca-tattva distributed love of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:24|Cc. Ādi 7.24]]
  : Although the members of the Pañca-tattva plundered the storehouse of love of Godhead and ate and distributed its contents, there was no scarcity, for this wonderful storehouse is so complete that as the love is distributed, the supply increases hundreds of times.

  ; [[.7:25|Cc. Ādi 7.25]]
  : The flood of love of Godhead swelled in all directions, and thus young men, old men, women and children were all immersed in that inundation.

  ; [[.7:26|Cc. Ādi 7.26]]
  : The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will inundate the entire world and drown everyone, whether one be a gentleman, a rogue or even lame, invalid or blind.

  ; [[.7:27|Cc. Ādi 7.27]]
  : When the five members of the Pañca-tattva saw the entire world drowned in love of Godhead and the seed of material enjoyment in the living entities completely destroyed, they all became exceedingly happy.

  ; [[.7:28|Cc. Ādi 7.28]]
  : The more the five members of the Pañca-tattva cause the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world.

  ; [[.7:29-30|Cc. Ādi 7.29-30]]
  : The impersonalists, fruitive workers, false logicians, blasphemers, nondevotees and lowest among the student community are very expert in avoiding the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and therefore the inundation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot touch them.

  ; [[.7:31-32|Cc. Ādi 7.31-32]]
  : Seeing that the Māyāvādīs and others were fleeing, Lord Caitanya thought: I wanted everyone to be immersed in this inundation of love of Godhead, but some of them have escaped. Therefore I shall devise a trick to drown them also.

  ; [[.7:33|Cc. Ādi 7.33]]
  : Thus the Lord accepted the sannyāsa order of life after full consideration.

  ; [[.7:34|Cc. Ādi 7.34]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained in householder life for twenty-four years, and on the verge of His twenty-fifth year He accepted the sannyāsa order.

  ; [[.7:35|Cc. Ādi 7.35]]
  : After accepting the sannyāsa order, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu attracted the attention of all those who had evaded Him, beginning with the logicians.

  ; [[.7:36|Cc. Ādi 7.36]]
  : Thus the students, infidels, fruitive workers and critics all came to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.7:37|Cc. Ādi 7.37]]
  : Lord Caitanya excused them all, and they merged into the ocean of devotional service, for no one can escape the unique loving network of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.7:38|Cc. Ādi 7.38]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in order to deliver all the fallen souls. Therefore He devised many methods to liberate them from the clutches of māyā.

  ; [[.7:39|Cc. Ādi 7.39]]
  : All were converted into devotees of Lord Caitanya, even the mlecchas and yavanas. Only the impersonalist followers of Śaṅkarācārya evaded Him.

  ; [[.7:40|Cc. Ādi 7.40]]
  : While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was passing through Vārāṇasī on His way to Vṛndāvana, the Māyāvādī sannyāsī philosophers blasphemed against Him in many ways.

  ; [[.7:41|Cc. Ādi 7.41]]
  : "Although a sannyāsī, He does not take interest in the study of Vedānta but instead always engages in chanting and dancing in saṅkīrtana.

  ; [[.7:42|Cc. Ādi 7.42]]
  : "This Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an illiterate sannyāsī and therefore does not know His real function. Guided only by His sentiments, He wanders about in the company of other sentimentalists."

  ; [[.7:43|Cc. Ādi 7.43]]
  : Hearing all this blasphemy, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu merely smiled to Himself, rejected all these accusations and did not talk with the Māyāvādīs.

  ; [[.7:44|Cc. Ādi 7.44]]
  : Thus neglecting the blasphemy of the Vārāṇasī Māyāvādīs, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu proceeded to Mathurā, and after visiting Mathurā He returned to meet the situation.

  ; [[.7:45|Cc. Ādi 7.45]]
  : This time Lord Caitanya stayed at the house of Candraśekhara, although he was regarded as a śūdra or kāyastha, for the Lord, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is completely independent.

  ; [[.7:46|Cc. Ādi 7.46]]
  : As a matter of principle, Lord Caitanya regularly accepted His food at the house of Tapana Miśra. He never mixed with other sannyāsīs, nor did He accept invitations from them.

  ; [[.7:47|Cc. Ādi 7.47]]
  : When Sanātana Gosvāmī came from Bengal, he met Lord Caitanya at the house of Tapana Miśra, where Lord Caitanya remained continuously for two months to teach him devotional service.

  ; [[.7:48|Cc. Ādi 7.48]]
  : On the basis of scriptures like Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which reveal these confidential directions, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī regarding all the regular activities of a devotee.

  ; [[.7:49|Cc. Ādi 7.49]]
  : While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was instructing Sanātana Gosvāmī, both Candraśekhara and Tapana Miśra became very unhappy. Therefore they submitted an appeal unto the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.7:50|Cc. Ādi 7.50]]
  : "How long can we tolerate the blasphemy of Your critics against Your conduct? We should give up our lives rather than hear such blasphemy.

  ; [[.7:51|Cc. Ādi 7.51]]
  : "The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs are all criticizing Your Holiness. We cannot tolerate hearing such criticism, for this blasphemy breaks our hearts."

  ; [[.7:52|Cc. Ādi 7.52]]
  : While Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara were thus talking with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He only smiled slightly and remained silent. At that time a brāhmaṇa came there to meet the Lord.

  ; [[.7:53|Cc. Ādi 7.53]]
  : The brāhmaṇa immediately fell at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu and requested Him to accept his proposal in a joyful mood.

  ; [[.7:54|Cc. Ādi 7.54]]
  : "My dear Lord, I have invited all the sannyāsīs of Benares to my home. My desires will be fulfilled if You also accept my invitation.

  ; [[.7:55|Cc. Ādi 7.55]]
  : "My dear Lord, I know that You never mix with other sannyāsīs, but please be merciful unto me and accept my invitation.

  ; [[.7:56|Cc. Ādi 7.56]]
  : Lord Caitanya smiled and accepted the invitation of the brāhmaṇa. He made this gesture to show His mercy to the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs.

  ; [[.7:57|Cc. Ādi 7.57]]
  :  TEXT 57
 57>The brāhmaṇa knew that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu never went to anyone else's house, yet due to inspiration from the Lord he earnestly requested Him to accept this invitation.

  ; [[.7:58|Cc. Ādi 7.58]]
  : The next day, when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the house of that brāhmaṇa, He saw all the sannyāsīs of Benares sitting there.

  ; [[.7:59|Cc. Ādi 7.59]]
  : As soon as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the sannyāsīs He immediately offered obeisances, and then He went to wash His feet. After washing His feet, He sat down by the place where He had done so.

  ; [[.7:60|Cc. Ādi 7.60]]
  : After sitting on the ground, Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His mystic power by manifesting an effulgence as brilliant as the illumination of millions of suns.

  ; [[.7:61|Cc. Ādi 7.61]]
  : When the sannyāsīs saw the brilliant illumination of the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, their minds were attracted, and they all immediately gave up their sitting places and stood in respect.

  ; [[.7:62|Cc. Ādi 7.62]]
  : The leader of all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs present was named Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, and after standing up he addressed Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as follows with great respect.

  ; [[.7:63|Cc. Ādi 7.63]]
  : "Please come here. Please come here, Your Holiness. Why do You sit in that unclean place? What has caused Your lamentation?"

  ; [[.7:64|Cc. Ādi 7.64]]
  : The Lord replied: "I belong to a lower order of sannyāsīs. Therefore I do not deserve to sit with you."

  ; [[.7:65|Cc. Ādi 7.65]]
  : Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, however, caught Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally by the hand and seated Him with great respect in the midst of the assembly.

  ; [[.7:66|Cc. Ādi 7.66]]
  : Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī then said: "I understand that Your name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. You are a disciple of Śrī Keśava Bhāratī, and therefore You are glorious.

  ; [[.7:67|Cc. Ādi 7.67]]
  : "You belong to our Śaṅkara-sampradāya and live in our village, Vārāṇasī. Why then do You not associate with us? Why is it that You avoid even seeing us?

  ; [[.7:68|Cc. Ādi 7.68]]
  : "You are a sannyāsī. Why then do You indulge in chanting and dancing, engaging in Your saṅkīrtana movement in the company of fanatics?

  ; [[.7:69|Cc. Ādi 7.69]]
  : "Meditation and the study of Vedānta are the sole duties of a sannyāsī. Why do You abandon these to dance with fanatics?

  ; [[.7:70|Cc. Ādi 7.70]]
  : "You look as brilliant as if You were Nārāyaṇa Himself. Will You kindly explain the reason that You have adopted the behavior of lower-class people?"

  ; [[.7:71|Cc. Ādi 7.71]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, "My dear sir, kindly hear the reason. My spiritual master considered Me a fool, and therefore he chastised Me.

  ; [[.7:72|Cc. Ādi 7.72]]
  : " 'You are a fool,' he said. 'You are not qualified to study Vedānta philosophy, and therefore You must always chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. This is the essence of all mantras, or Vedic hymns.

  ; [[.7:73|Cc. Ādi 7.73]]
  : "Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa one can obtain freedom from material existence. Indeed, simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra one will be able to see the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.7:74|Cc. Ādi 7.74]]
  : " 'In this Age of Kali there is no religious principle other than the chanting of the holy name, which is the essence of all Vedic hymns. This is the purport of all scriptures.'

  ; [[.7:75|Cc. Ādi 7.75]]
  : "After describing the potency of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, My spiritual master taught Me another verse, advising Me to always keep it within My throat.

  ; [[.7:76|Cc. Ādi 7.76]]
  : " 'For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali, there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.'

  ; [[.7:77|Cc. Ādi 7.77]]
  : "Since I received this order from My spiritual master, I always chant the holy name, but I think that by chanting and chanting the holy name I have been bewildered.

  ; [[.7:78|Cc. Ādi 7.78]]
  : "While chanting the holy name of the Lord in pure ecstasy, I lose myself, and thus I laugh, cry, dance and sing just like a madman.

  ; [[.7:79|Cc. Ādi 7.79]]
  : "Collecting My patience, therefore, I began to consider that chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa had covered all My spiritual knowledge.

  ; [[.7:80|Cc. Ādi 7.80]]
  : "I saw that I had become mad by chanting the holy name, and I immediately submitted this at the lotus feet of my spiritual master.

  ; [[.7:81|Cc. Ādi 7.81]]
  : " 'My dear lord, what kind of mantra have you given Me? I have become mad simply by chanting this mahā-mantra!

  ; [[.7:82|Cc. Ādi 7.82]]
  : " 'Chanting the holy name in ecstasy causes Me to dance, laugh and cry.' When My spiritual master heard all this, he smiled and then began to speak.

  ; [[.7:83|Cc. Ādi 7.83]]
  : It is the nature of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra that anyone who chants it immediately develops his loving ecstasy for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.7:84|Cc. Ādi 7.84]]
  : " 'Religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation are known as the four goals of life, but before love of Godhead, the fifth and highest goal, these appear as insignificant as straw in the street.

  ; [[.7:85|Cc. Ādi 7.85]]
  : " 'For a devotee who has actually developed bhāva, the pleasure derived from dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa appears like a drop in the presence of the sea.

  ; [[.7:86|Cc. Ādi 7.86]]
  : " 'The conclusion of all revealed scriptures is that one should awaken his dormant love of Godhead. You are greatly fortunate to have already done so.

  ; [[.7:87|Cc. Ādi 7.87]]
  : " 'It is a characteristic of love of Godhead that by nature it induces transcendental symptoms in one's body and makes one more and more greedy to achieve the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.7:88|Cc. Ādi 7.88]]
  : " 'When one actually develops love of Godhead, he naturally sometimes cries, sometimes laughs, sometimes chants and sometimes runs here and there just like a madman.

  ; [[.7:89-90|Cc. Ādi 7.89-90]]
  : " 'Perspiration, trembling, standing on end of one's bodily hairs, tears, faltering voice, fading complexion, madness, melancholy, patience, pride, joy and humility---these are various natural symptoms of ecstatic love of Godhead, which causes a devotee to dance and float in an ocean of transcendental bliss while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.

  ; [[.7:91|Cc. Ādi 7.91]]
  : " 'It is very good, my dear child, that You have attained the supreme goal of life by developing love of Godhead. Thus You have pleased me very much, and I am very much obliged to You.

  ; [[.7:92|Cc. Ādi 7.92]]
  : " 'My dear child, continue dancing, chanting and performing saṅkīrtana in association with devotees. Furthermore, go out and preach the value of chanting kṛṣṇa-nāma, for by this process You will be able to deliver all fallen souls.'

  ; [[.7:93|Cc. Ādi 7.93]]
  : "Saying this, My spiritual master taught Me a verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It is the essence of all the Bhāgavatam's instructions; therefore he instructed Me on this verse again and again."

  ; [[.7:94|Cc. Ādi 7.94]]
  : " 'When a person is actually advanced and takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is very dear to him, he is agitated and loudly chants the holy name. He also laughs, cries, becomes agitated and chants just like a madman, not caring for outsiders.'

  ; [[.7:95-96|Cc. Ādi 7.95-96]]
  : "I firmly believe in these words of My spiritual master, and therefore I always chant the holy name of the Lord, alone and in the association of devotees. That holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa sometimes causes Me to chant and dance, and therefore I chant and dance. Please do not think that I intentionally do it. I do it automatically.

  ; [[.7:97|Cc. Ādi 7.97]]
  : "Compared to the ocean of transcendental bliss that is tasted by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the pleasure derived from impersonal Brahman realization [brahmānanda] is like the shallow water in a canal.

  ; [[.7:98|Cc. Ādi 7.98]]
  : " 'My dear Lord, O master of the universe, since I have directly seen You, my transcendental bliss has taken the shape of a great ocean. Being situated in that ocean, I now realize all other so-called happiness to be like the water contained in the hoofprint of a calf.' "

  ; [[.7:99|Cc. Ādi 7.99]]
  : After hearing Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs were moved. Their minds changed, and thus they spoke with pleasing words.

  ; [[.7:100|Cc. Ādi 7.100]]
  : "Dear Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, what You have said is all true. Only one who is favored by fortune attains love of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:101|Cc. Ādi 7.101]]
  : "Dear sir, there is no objection to Your being a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is satisfied with this. But why do You avoid discussion on the Vedānta-sūtra? What is the fault in it?"

  ; [[.7:102|Cc. Ādi 7.102]]
  : After hearing the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs speak in that way, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled slightly and said, "My dear sirs, if you don't mind I can say something to you regarding Vedānta philosophy."

  ; [[.7:103|Cc. Ādi 7.103]]
  : Hearing this, the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs became somewhat humble and addressed Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Nārāyaṇa Himself, who they all agreed He was.

  ; [[.7:104|Cc. Ādi 7.104]]
  : "Dear Caitanya Mahāprabhu," they said, "to tell You the truth, we are greatly pleased to hear Your words, and furthermore Your bodily features are so pleasing that we feel extraordinary satisfaction in seeing You.

  ; [[.7:105|Cc. Ādi 7.105]]
  : "Dear sir, by Your influence our minds are greatly satisfied, and we believe that Your words will never be unreasonable. Therefore You can speak on the Vedānta-sūtra."

  ; [[.7:106|Cc. Ādi 7.106]]
  : The Lord said, "Vedānta philosophy consists of words spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa in the form of Vyāsadeva.

  ; [[.7:107|Cc. Ādi 7.107]]
  : "The material defects of mistakes, illusions, cheating and sensory inefficiency do not exist in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:108|Cc. Ādi 7.108]]
  : "The Absolute Truth is described by the Upaniṣads and Brahma-sūtra, but one must understand the verses as they are. That is the supreme glory in understanding.

  ; [[.7:109|Cc. Ādi 7.109]]
  : "Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya has described all the Vedic literatures in terms of indirect meanings. One who hears such explanations is ruined.

  ; [[.7:110|Cc. Ādi 7.110]]
  : "Śaṅkarācārya is not at fault, for he has thus covered the real purpose of the Vedas under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:111|Cc. Ādi 7.111]]
  : "According to direct understanding, the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has all spiritual opulences. No one can be equal to or greater than Him.

  ; [[.7:112|Cc. Ādi 7.112]]
  : "Everything about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is spiritual, including His body, opulence and paraphernalia. Māyāvāda philosophy, however, covering His spiritual opulence, advocates the theory of impersonalism.

  ; [[.7:113|Cc. Ādi 7.113]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full of spiritual potencies. Therefore His body, name, fame and entourage are all spiritual. The Māyāvādī philosopher, due to ignorance, says that these are all merely transformations of the material mode of goodness.

  ; [[.7:114|Cc. Ādi 7.114]]
  : "Śaṅkarācārya, who is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless because he is a servant carrying out the orders of the Lord. But those who follow his Māyāvādī philosophy are doomed. They will lose all their advancement in spiritual knowledge.

  ; [[.7:115|Cc. Ādi 7.115]]
  : "One who considers the transcendental body of Lord Viṣṇu to be made of material nature is the greatest offender at the lotus feet of the Lord. There is no greater blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.7:116|Cc. Ādi 7.116]]
  : "The Lord is like a great blazing fire, and the living entities are like small sparks of that fire.

  ; [[.7:117|Cc. Ādi 7.117]]
  : "The living entities are energies, not the energetic. The energetic is Kṛṣṇa. This is very vividly described in the Bhagavad-gītā, the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and other Vedic scriptures.

  ; [[.7:118|Cc. Ādi 7.118]]
  : " 'Besides these inferior energies, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises all living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.'.'

  ; [[.7:119|Cc. Ādi 7.119]]
  : " 'The potency of Lord Viṣṇu is summarized in three categories-namely, the spiritual potency, the living entities and ignorance. The spiritual potency is full of knowledge; the living entities, although belonging to the spiritual potency, are subject to bewilderment; and the third energy, which is full of ignorance, is always visible in fruitive activities.'

  ; [[.7:120|Cc. Ādi 7.120]]
  : "The Māyāvāda philosophy is so degraded that it has taken the insignificant living entities to be the Lord, the Supreme Truth, thus covering the glory and supremacy of the Absolute Truth with monism.

  ; [[.7:121|Cc. Ādi 7.121]]
  : "In his Vedānta-sūtra Śrīla Vyāsadeva has described that everything is but a transformation of the energy of the Lord. Śaṅkarācārya, however, has misled the world by commenting that Vyāsadeva was mistaken. Thus he has raised great opposition to theism throughout the entire world.

  ; [[.7:122|Cc. Ādi 7.122]]
  : "According to Śaṅkarācārya, by accepting the theory of the transformation of the energy of the Lord, one creates an illusion by indirectly accepting that the Absolute Truth is transformed.

  ; [[.7:123|Cc. Ādi 7.123]]
  : "Transformation of energy is a proven fact. It is the false bodily conception of the self that is an illusion.

  ; [[.7:124|Cc. Ādi 7.124]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is opulent in all respects. Therefore by His inconceivable energies He has transformed the material cosmic manifestation.

  ; [[.7:125|Cc. Ādi 7.125]]
  : "Using the example of a touchstone, which by its energy turns iron to gold and yet remains the same, we can understand that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead transforms His innumerable energies, He remains unchanged.

  ; [[.7:126|Cc. Ādi 7.126]]
  : "Although a touchstone produces many varieties of valuable jewels, it nevertheless remains the same. It does not change its original form.

  ; [[.7:127|Cc. Ādi 7.127]]
  : "If there is such inconceivable potency in material objects, why should we not believe in the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?

  ; [[.7:128|Cc. Ādi 7.128]]
  : "The Vedic sound vibration oṁkāra, the principal word in the Vedic scriptures, is the basis of all Vedic vibrations. Therefore one should accept oṁkāra as the sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the reservoir of the cosmic manifestation.
PURPORT

  ; [[.7:129|Cc. Ādi 7.129]]
  : "It is the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to present praṇava [oṁkāra] as the reservoir of all Vedic knowledge. The words tat tvam asi are only a partial explanation of the Vedic knowledge.

  ; [[.7:130|Cc. Ādi 7.130]]
  : "Praṇava [oṁkāra] is the mahā-vākya [mahā-mantra] in the Vedas. Śaṅkarācārya's followers cover this to stress without authority the mantra tat tvam asi.

  ; [[.7:131|Cc. Ādi 7.131]]
  : "In all the Vedic sūtras and scriptures, it is Lord Kṛṣṇa who is to be understood, but the followers of Śaṅkarācārya have covered the real meaning of the Vedas with indirect explanations.

  ; [[.7:132|Cc. Ādi 7.132]]
  : "The self-evident Vedic scriptures are the highest evidence of all, but if these scriptures are interpreted, their self-evident nature is lost.

  ; [[.7:133|Cc. Ādi 7.133]]
  : "To prove their philosophy, the members of the Māyāvāda school have given up the real, easily understood meaning of the Vedic literature and introduced indirect meanings based on their imaginative powers."

  ; [[.7:134|Cc. Ādi 7.134]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus showed for each and every sūtra the defects in Śaṅkarācārya's explanations, all the assembled Māyāvādī sannyāsīs were struck with wonder.

  ; [[.7:135|Cc. Ādi 7.135]]
  : All the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs said, "Your Holiness, kindly know from us that we actually have no quarrel with Your refutation of these meanings, for You have given a clear understanding of the sūtras.

  ; [[.7:136|Cc. Ādi 7.136]]
  : "We know that all this word jugglery springs from the imagination of Śaṅkarārārya, and yet because we belong to his sect, we accept it although it does not satisfy us.

  ; [[.7:137|Cc. Ādi 7.137]]
  : "Now let us see," the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs continued, "how well You can describe the sūtras in terms of their direct meaning." Hearing this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu began His direct explanation of the Vedānta-sūtra.

  ; [[.7:138|Cc. Ādi 7.138]]
  : "Brahman, who is greater than the greatest, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is full of six opulences, and therefore He is the reservoir of ultimate truth and absolute knowledge.

  ; [[.7:139|Cc. Ādi 7.139]]
  : "In His original form the Supreme Personality of Godhead is full of transcendental opulences, which are free from the contamination of the material world. It is to be understood that in all Vedic literature the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal.

  ; [[.7:140|Cc. Ādi 7.140]]
  : "When we speak of the Supreme as impersonal, we deny His spiritual potencies. Logically, if you accept half of the truth, you cannot understand the whole.

  ; [[.7:141|Cc. Ādi 7.141]]
  : "It is only by devotional service, beginning with hearing, that one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the only means to approach Him.

  ; [[.7:142|Cc. Ādi 7.142]]
  : "By practicing this regulated devotional service under the direction of the spiritual master, certainly one awakens his dormant love of Godhead. This process is called abhidheya.

  ; [[.7:143|Cc. Ādi 7.143]]
  : "If one develops his love of Godhead and becomes attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, gradually he loses his attachment to everything else.

  ; [[.7:144|Cc. Ādi 7.144]]
  : "Love of Godhead is so exalted that it is considered to be the fifth goal of human life. By awakening one's love of Godhead, one can attain the platform of conjugal love, tasting it even during the present span of life.

  ; [[.7:145|Cc. Ādi 7.145]]
  : "The Supreme Lord, who is greater than the greatest, becomes submissive to even a very insignificant devotee because of his devotional service. It is the beautiful and exalted nature of devotional service that the infinite Lord becomes submissive to the infinitesimal living entity because of it. In reciprocal devotional activities with the Lord, the devotee actually enjoys the transcendental mellow quality of devotional service.

  ; [[.7:146|Cc. Ādi 7.146]]
  : "One's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, activities in terms of that relationship, and the ultimate goal of life [to develop love of God]---these three subjects are explained in every aphorism of the Vedānta-sūtra, for they form the culmination of the entire Vedānta philosophy."

  ; [[.7:147|Cc. Ādi 7.147]]
  : When all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs thus heard the explanation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the basis of sambandha, abhidheya and prayojana, they spoke very humbly.

  ; [[.7:148|Cc. Ādi 7.148]]
  : "Dear sir, You are Vedic knowledge personified and are directly Nārāyaṇa Himself. Kindly excuse us for the offenses we previously committed by criticizing You."

  ; [[.7:149|Cc. Ādi 7.149]]
  : From that moment when the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs heard the explanation of the Vedānta-sūtra from the Lord, their minds changed, and on the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they too chanted "Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!" always.

  ; [[.7:150|Cc. Ādi 7.150]]
  : Thus Lord Caitanya excused all the offenses of the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs and very mercifully blessed them with kṛṣṇa-nāma.

  ; [[.7:151|Cc. Ādi 7.151]]
  : After this, all the sannyāsīs took the Lord in their midst, and thus they all took their meal together.

  ; [[.7:152|Cc. Ādi 7.152]]
  : After taking lunch among the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is known as Gaurasundara, returned to His residence. Thus the Lord performs His wonderful pastimes.

  ; [[.7:153|Cc. Ādi 7.153]]
  : Hearing the arguments of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and seeing His victory, Candraśekhara, Tapana Miśra and Sanātana Gosvāmī were all extremely pleased.

  ; [[.7:154|Cc. Ādi 7.154]]

  : Whenever Lord Caitanya went to the banks of the Ganges to take His bath, big crowds of many hundreds of thousands of people also assembled there.

  ; [[.7:159|Cc. Ādi 7.159]]
  : Whenever the crowds were too great, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stood up, raised His hands and chanted, "Hari! Hari!" to which all the people responded, filling both the land and sky with the vibration.

  ; [[.7:160|Cc. Ādi 7.160]]
  : After thus delivering the people in general, the Lord desired to leave Vārāṇasī. After instructing Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, He sent him toward Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.7:161|Cc. Ādi 7.161]]
  : Because the city of Vārāṇasī was always full of tumultuous crowds, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, after sending Sanātana to Vṛndāvana, returned to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.7:162|Cc. Ādi 7.162]]
  : I have here given a brief account of these pastimes of Lord Caitanya, but later I shall describe them in an extensive way.

  ; [[.7:163|Cc. Ādi 7.163]]
  : Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates of the Pañca-tattva distributed the holy name of the Lord to invoke love of Godhead throughout the universe, and thus the entire universe was thankful.

  ; [[.7:164|Cc. Ādi 7.164]]
  : Lord Caitanya dispatched the two generals Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī to Vṛndāvana to preach the bhakti cult.

  ; [[.7:165|Cc. Ādi 7.165]]
  : As Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī were sent toward Mathurā, so Nityānanda Prabhu was sent to Bengal to preach extensively the cult of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.7:166|Cc. Ādi 7.166]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally went to South India, and He broadcast the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa in every village and town.

  ; [[.7:167|Cc. Ādi 7.167]]
  : Thus the Lord went to the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, known as Setubandha [Cape Comorin]. Everywhere He distributed the bhakti cult and love of Kṛṣṇa, and in this way He delivered everyone.

  ; [[.7:168|Cc. Ādi 7.168]]
  : I thus explain the truth of the Pañca-tattva. One who hears this explanation increases in knowledge of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.7:169|Cc. Ādi 7.169]]
  : While chanting the Pañca-tattva mahā-mantra, one must chant the names of Śrī Caitanya, Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa with their many devotees. This is the process.

  ; [[.7:170|Cc. Ādi 7.170]]
  : I again and again offer obeisances unto the Pañca-tattva. Thus I think that I will be able to describe something about the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.7:171|Cc. Ādi 7.171]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
