===== Purport =====

The word //uttāna// is also used to mean "lying down on the bed face upwards" or "lying down flat on the bed." In some readings the word is //utthāna,// which means "standing up." In His childhood pastimes the Lord tried to catch the wall and stand up, but as an ordinary child falls down, so the Lord also fell down and again took to lying on His bed.
