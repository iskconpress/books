===== Purport =====

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.8.45) it is said: "Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is worshiped with exalted hymns by all the //Vedas// and //Upaniṣads// and by great personalities through //sāṅkhya-yoga// in the mode of goodness, was considered by mother Yaśodā and Nanda to be their own little son." Similarly, Jagannātha Miśra also considered Lord Caitanya Mahāprahhu his beloved little boy, although He is worshiped with all veneration by learned //brāhmaṇas// and saintly persons.
