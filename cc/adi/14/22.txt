===== Purport =====

In the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// this pastime is described as follows: "The Lord, with His beautiful eyes, would cry, but He would stop immediately upon hearing the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// When the ladies, understanding the fun of the Lord, discovered that He would cry and then stop upon hearing the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// they all took it as a clue to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa as soon as the Lord cried. Thus it became a regular function. The Lord would cry, and the ladies would begin chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// clapping their hands. In this way all the ladies of the neighboring houses would assemble in the home of Śacīmātā to join in the //saṅkīrtana// movement twenty-four hours a day. As long as the ladies continued to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// the Lord would not cry but very pleasingly smile upon them."
