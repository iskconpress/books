The //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-līlā,// Chapter Six, fully describes the Lord's accepting //viṣṇu-prasāda// on the Ekādaśī day at the house of Jagadīśa and Hiraṇya. Regular //prasāda// is offered to Lord Viṣṇu on Ekādaśī because, while fasting is recommended for devotees on Ekādaśī, it is not recommended for Lord Viṣṇu. Once on Ekādaśī in the house of Jagadīśa and Hiraṇya Paṇḍita there were arrangements for preparing special //prasāda// for Lord Viṣṇu, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked His father to go there to ask for the //viṣṇu-prasāda// because He was feeling sick. The house of Jagadīśa and Hiraṇya Paṇḍita was situated about two miles from the house of Jagannātha Miśra. Therefore when Jagannātha Miśra, on the request of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, came to ask Jagadīśa and Hiraṇya for the //prasāda,// they were a little astonished. How could the boy understand that special //prasāda// was being prepared for Lord Viṣṇu? They immediately concluded that the boy Nimāi must have supernatural mystic power. Otherwise how could He understand that they were preparing special //prasāda//? Therefore they immediately sent the food to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu through His father, Jagannātha Miśra. Nimāi was feeling sick, but immediately after eating the //viṣṇu-prasāda// He was cured, and He also distributed the //prasāda// among His playmates.
