**After some days Jagannātha Miśra inaugurated the primary education of his son by performing the hāte khaḍi ceremony. Within a very few days the Lord learned all the letters and combinations of letters.**

===== Purport =====

The twelve //phalā,// or combinations of letters, are called //repha, mūrdhanya// (cerebral), //ṇa, dāntavya// (dental), //na, ma, ya, ra, la, va, ṛ, ṝ, ḷ// and //ḷ. Hāte khaḍi// is the primary educational beginning. At the age of four or five years, on an auspicious day called //vidyārambha// marking the beginning of primary education, there is a ceremony worshiping Lord Viṣṇu, and after that the teacher gives the child a long chalk pencil. Then, guiding the hand of the student, he instructs him how to write the letters of the alphabet (//a, ā, i,// etc.) by writing big letters on the floor. When the child is a little advanced in writing, he is given a slate for his primary education, which ends when he learns the two-letter combinations, which are called //phalā,// as mentioned above.
