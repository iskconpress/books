Generally it is the ambition of a young girl to have a very handsome husband who is learned, clever, young and rich. According to the Vedic culture, one is rich if he possesses a large stock of food grains and a very large number of animals. //Dhānyena dhanavān gavayā dhanavān:// one is rich if he possesses food grains, cows and bulls. A girl also desires to have many children, especially sons (//putra//) who are very intelligent and long-lived. Now because society has deteriorated there is propaganda to have one or two children and kill the rest by contraceptive methods. But the natural ambition of a girl is to possess not only more than one child but at least half a dozen.

In exchange for the paraphernalia of worship He usurped for Himself, Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to bless the girls to fulfill all their ambitions and desires. One can easily become happy and obtain the material benefits of a good husband, wealth, food grains and a number of nice children by worshiping Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa// at an early age, it is not necessary for His devotees to follow Him by also taking //sannyāsa.// One can stay a householder, but one must be a devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then one will be happy, with all the material opulences of a good home, good children, good mate, good wealth and everything he desires. Therefore the //śāstras// advise, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// (//Bhāg.// 11.5.32). Every householder, therefore, who is actually intelligent should introduce the //saṅkīrtana// movement home to home and live peacefully in this life and go back to Godhead in the next.
