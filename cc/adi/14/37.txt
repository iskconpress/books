The story of the deliverance of this //brāhmaṇa// is as follows. One //brāhmaṇa// who was touring all over the country, traveling from one place of pilgrimage to another, reached Navadvīpa and became a guest in the house of Jagannātha Miśra. Jagannātha Miśra gave him all ingredients for cooking, and the //brāhmaṇa// prepared his food. When the //brāhmaṇa// was offering the food to Lord Viṣṇu in meditation, the child Nimāi came before him and began to eat it, and because of this the //brāhmaṇa// thought the whole offering spoiled. Therefore by the request of Jagannātha Miśra he cooked for a second time, but when he was meditating the child again came before him and began to eat the food, again spoiling the offering. By the request of Jagannātha Miśra the //brāhmaṇa// cooked for a third time, but for a third time the Lord came before him and began to eat the food, although the child had been locked within a room and everyone was sleeping because it was late at night. Thus, thinking that on that day Lord Viṣṇu was not willing to accept his food and that he was therefore ordained to fast, the //brāhmaṇa// became greatly agitated and cried aloud, //hāya hāya:// "What has been done! What has been done!". When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the //brāhmaṇa// in that agitated state, He told him, "Formerly I was the son of mother Yaśodā. At that time you also became a guest in the house of Nanda Mahārāja, and I disturbed you in this way. I am very much pleased by your devotion. Therefore I am eating the food you have prepared." Understanding the favor offered to him by the Lord, the //brāhmaṇa// was greatly pleased, and he was overwhelmed with love of Kṛṣṇa. He was thankful to the Lord, for he felt himself greatly fortunate. Then the Lord asked the //brāhmaṇa// not to disclose the incident to anyone else. This is very elaborately explained in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-līlā,// Chapter Three.
