Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the most benevolent personality in human society because His only desire is to make people happy. His //saṅkīrtana// movement is especially meant for the purpose of making people happy. He wanted to become the tree Himself because a tree is supposed to be the most benevolent living entity. In the following verse, which is from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.22.33), Kṛṣṇa Himself highly praised the existence of a tree.
