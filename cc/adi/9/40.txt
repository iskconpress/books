This prediction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's is now actually coming to pass. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being distributed all over the world through the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// and people who were leading confused, chaotic lives are now feeling transcendental happiness. They are finding peace in //saṅkīrtana,// and therefore they are acknowledging the supreme benefit of this movement. This is the blessing of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His prediction is now factually being fulfilled, and those who are sober and conscientious are appreciating the value of this great movement.
