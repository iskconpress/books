This is the sum and substance of Lord Caitanya's //saṅkīrtana// movement. There is no distinction made between those who are fit and those who are not fit to hear or take part in the //saṅkīrtana// movement. It should therefore be preached without discrimination. The only purpose of the preachers of the //saṅkīrtana// movement must be to go on preaching without restriction. That is the way in which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced this //saṅkīrtana// movement to the world.
