Here Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu indicates that the distribution of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// should be performed by combined forces. Although He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He laments, "How can I act alone? How can I alone pick the fruit and distribute it all over the world?" This indicates that all classes of devotees should combine to distribute the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// without consideration of the time, place or situation.
