===== Purport =====

In many places devotional service has been compared to a creeper. One has to sow the seed of the devotional creeper, //bhakti-latā,// within his heart. As he regularly hears and chants, the seed will fructify and gradually grow into a mature plant and then produce the fruit of devotional service, namely, love of Godhead, which the gardener (//mālā-kāra//) can then enjoy without impediments.
