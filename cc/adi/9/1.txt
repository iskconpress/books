Sometimes it is to be seen that a dog can swim in the water for a few yards and then come back to the shore. Here, however, it is stated that if a dog is blessed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he can swim across an ocean. Similarly, the author of //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, placing himself in a helpless condition, states that he has no personal power, but by the desire of Lord Caitanya, expressed through the Vaiṣṇavas and Madana-mohana //vigraha,// it is possible for him to cross a transcendental ocean to present //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//
