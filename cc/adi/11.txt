====== The Expansions of Lord Nityānanda =====

As the branches and subbranches of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu were described in the Tenth Chapter, in this Eleventh Chapter the branches and subbranches of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu are similarly listed.

  ; [[.11:1|CC Ādi 11.1]]
  : After offering my obeisances unto all of the devotees of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, who are like bumblebees collecting honey from His lotus feet, I shall try to describe those who are the most prominent.

  ; [[.11:2|CC Ādi 11.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! Anyone who has taken shelter at His lotus feet is glorious.

  ; [[.11:3|CC Ādi 11.3]]
  : All glories to Śrī Advaita Prabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and all the devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[.11:4|CC Ādi 11.4]]
  : Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu is the topmost branch of the indestructible tree of eternal love of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. I offer my respectful obeisances to all the subbranches of that topmost branch.

  ; [[.11:5|CC Ādi 11.5]]
  : Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu is an extremely heavy branch of the Śrī Caitanya tree. From that branch grow many branches and subbranches.

  ; [[.11:6|CC Ādi 11.6]]
  : Watered by the desire of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, these branches and subbranches have grown unlimitedly and covered the entire world with fruits and flowers.

  ; [[.11:7|CC Ādi 11.7]]
  : These branches and subbranches of devotees are innumerable and unlimited. Who could count them? For my personal purification I shall try to enumerate only the most prominent among them.

  ; [[.11:8|CC Ādi 11.8]]
  : After Nityānanda Prabhu, the greatest branch is Vīrabhadra Gosāñi, who also has innumerable branches and subbranches. It is not possible to describe them all.

  ; [[.11:9|CC Ādi 11.9]]
  : Although Vīrabhadra Gosāñi was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He presented Himself as a great devotee. And although the Supreme Godhead is transcendental to all Vedic injunctions, He strictly followed the Vedic rituals.

  ; [[.11:10|CC Ādi 11.10]]
  : He is the main pillar in the hall of devotional service erected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He knew within Himself that He acted as the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, but externally He was prideless.

  ; [[.11:11|CC Ādi 11.11]]
  : It is by the glorious mercy of Śrī Vīrabhadra Gosāñi that people all over the world now have the chance to chant the names of Caitanya and Nityānanda.

  ; [[.11:12|CC Ādi 11.12]]
  : I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of Vīrabhadra Gosāñi so that by His mercy my great desire to write Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta will be properly guided.

  ; [[.11:13|CC Ādi 11.13]]
  : Two devotees of Lord Caitanya, named Śrī Rāmadāsa and Gadādhara dāsa, always lived with Śrī Vīrabhadra Gosāñi.

  ; [[.11:14-15|CC Ādi 11.14-15]]
  : When Nityānanda Prabhu was ordered to go to Bengal to preach, these two devotees [Śrī Rāmadāsa and Gadādhara dāsa] were ordered to go with Him. Thus they are sometimes counted among the devotees of Lord Caitanya and sometimes among the devotees of Lord Nityānanda. Similarly, Mādhava and Vāsudeva Ghoṣa belonged to both groups of devotees simultaneously.

  ; [[.11:16|CC Ādi 11.16]]
  : Rāmadāsa, one of the chief branches, was full of fraternal love of Godhead. He made a flute from a stick with sixteen knots.

  : Śrī Mādhava Ghoṣa was a principal performer of kīrtana. While he sang, Nityānanda Prabhu danced.

  ; [[.11:19|CC Ādi 11.19]]
  : When Vāsudeva Ghoṣa performed kīrtana, describing Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda, even wood and stone would melt upon hearing it.

  ; [[.11:20|CC Ādi 11.20]]

  ; [[.11:29|CC Ādi 11.29]]
  : Parameśvara dāsa, said to be the fifth gopāla of kṛṣṇa-līlā, completely surrendered to the lotus feet of Nityānanda. Anyone who remembers his name, Parameśvara dāsa, will get love of Kṛṣṇa very easily.

  ; [[.11:30|CC Ādi 11.30]]
