Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has placed the verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// quoted in text 52 (//kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam//) as the auspicious introduction to his //Bhāgavata-sandarbha,// or //Ṣaṭ-sandarbha.// He has composed this text (81), which is, in effect, an explanation of the //Bhāgavatam// verse, as the second verse of the same work. The verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was enunciated by Karabhājana, one of the nine great sages, and it is elaborately explained by the //Sarva-saṁvādinī,// Jīva Gosvāmī's commentary on his own //Ṣaṭ-sandarbha.//

Antaḥ kṛṣṇa refers to one who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. This attitude is a predominant feature of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Even though many devotees always think of Kṛṣṇa, none can surpass the //gopīs,// among whom Rādhārāṇī is the leader in thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Rādhārāṇī's Kṛṣṇa consciousness surpasses that of all other devotees. Lord Caitanya accepted the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī to understand Kṛṣṇa; therefore He was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the same way as Rādhārāṇī. By thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa, He always overlapped Kṛṣṇa.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, who was outwardly very fair, with a complexion like molten gold, simultaneously manifested His eternal associates, opulences, expansions and incarnations. He preached the process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and those who are under His lotus feet are glorious.
