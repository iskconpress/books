===== Purport =====

Now is the term of Vaivasvata Manu, during which Lord Caitanya appears. First Lord Kṛṣṇa appears at the close of the Dvāpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth //divya-yuga,// and then Lord Caitanya appears in the Kali-yuga of the same //divya-yuga.// Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya appear once in each day of Brahmā, or once in fourteen //manv-antaras,// each of seventy-one //divya-yugas// in duration.

From the beginning of Brahmā's day of 4,320,000,000 years, six Manus appear and disappear before Lord Kṛṣṇa appears. Thus 1,975,320,000 years of the day of Brahmā elapse before the appearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is an astronomical calculation according to solar years.
