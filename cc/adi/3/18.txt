===== Purport =====

Those engaged in devotional service according to the ritualistic principles mentioned in the scriptures attain these different kinds of liberation. But although such devotees can attain //sārṣṭi, sārūpya, sāmīpya// and //sālokya,// they are not concerned with these liberations, for such devotees are satisfied only in rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. The fifth kind of liberation, //sāyujya,// is never accepted even by devotees who perform only ritualistic worship. To attain //sāyujya,// or merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the aspiration of the impersonalists. A devotee never cares for //sāyujya// liberation.
