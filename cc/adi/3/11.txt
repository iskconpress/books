//Dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya// and //śṛṅgāra// are the transcendental modes of loving service to the Lord. //Śānta-rasa,// or the neutral stage, is not mentioned in this verse because although in //śānta-rasa// one considers the Absolute Truth the sublime great, one does not go beyond that conception. //Śānta-rasa// is a very grand idea for materialistic philosophers, but such idealistic appreciation is only the beginning; it is the lowest among the relationships in the spiritual world. //Śānta-rasa// is not given much importance because as soon as there is a slight understanding between the knower and the known, active loving transcendental reciprocations and exchanges begin. //Dāsya-rasa// is the basic relationship between Kṛṣṇa and His devotees; therefore this verse considers //dāsya// the first stage of transcendental devotional service.
