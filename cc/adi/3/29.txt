The //prathama-sandhyā// is the beginning of the age. According to astronomical calculation, the age is divided into twelve parts. The first of these twelve divisions is known as the //prathama-sandhyā.// The //prathama-sandhyā// and //śeṣa-sandhyā,// the last division of the preceding age, form the junction of the two ages. According to the //Sūrya-siddhānta,// the //prathama-sandhyā// of Kali-yuga lasts 36,000 solar years. Lord Caitanya appeared in the //prathama-sandhyā// after 4,586 solar years of Kali-yuga had passed.
