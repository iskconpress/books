{{description>"In His early pastimes He appears as a householder with a golden complexion. His limbs are beautiful, and His body, smeared with the pulp of sandalwood, seems like molten gold. In His later pastimes He accepts the sannyāsa order, and He is equipoised and peaceful. He is the highest abode of peace and devotion, for He silences the impersonalist nondevotees."}}

This is a verse from the //Mahābhārata// (//Dāna-dharma, Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-stotra//). In his commentary on the //Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma// called the //Nāmārtha-sudhā,// Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, commenting upon this verse, asserts that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the evidence of the //Upaniṣads.// He explains that //suvarṇa-varṇaḥ// means a golden complexion. He also quotes the Vedic injunction //yadā paśyaḥ paśyate rukma-varṇaṁ kartāram īśaṁ puruṣaṁ brahma-yonim// (//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 3.1.3). //Rukma-varṇaṁ kartāram īśam// refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as having a complexion the color of molten gold. //Puruṣam// means the Supreme Lord, and //brahma-yonim// indicates that He is also the Supreme Brahman. This evidence, too, proves that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. Another meaning of the description of the Lord as having a golden hue is that Lord Caitanya's personality is as fascinating as gold is attractive. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word //varāṅga// means "exquisitely beautiful."

Lord Caitanya accepted //sannyāsa,// leaving aside His householder life, to preach His mission. He has equanimity in different senses. First, He describes the confidential truth of the Personality of Godhead, and second, He satisfies everyone by knowledge and attachment to Kṛṣṇa. He is peaceful because He renounces all topics not related to the service of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has explained that the word //niṣṭhā// indicates His being rigidly fixed in chanting the holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya subdued all disturbing opponents of devotional service, especially the monists, who are actually averse to the personal feature of the Supreme Lord.
