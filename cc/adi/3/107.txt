Through devotional service one can easily please Lord Kṛṣṇa with a leaf of the //tulasī// plant and a little water. As the Lord says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]], a leaf, a flower, a fruit or some water (//patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam//), when offered with devotion, very much pleases Him. He universally accepts the services of His devotees. Even the poorest of devotees in any part of the world can secure a small flower, fruit or leaf and a little water, and if these offerings, and especially //tulasī// leaves and Ganges water, are offered to Kṛṣṇa with devotion, He is very satisfied. It is said that Kṛṣṇa is so pleased by such devotional service that He offers Himself to His devotee in exchange for it. Śrīla Advaita Ācārya knew this fact, and therefore He decided to call for the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa to descend by worshiping the Lord with //tulasī// leaves and the water of the Ganges.
