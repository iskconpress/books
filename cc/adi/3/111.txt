This text from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:9:11|(3.9.11)]] is a prayer by Lord Brahmā to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa for His blessings in the work of creation. Knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the descriptions of the Vedic scriptures. For example, the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.29) describes that in the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which is made of //cintāmaṇi// (touchstone), the Lord, acting as a cowherd boy, is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Māyāvādīs think that the devotees have imagined the form of Kṛṣṇa, but the authentic Vedic scriptures have actually described Kṛṣṇa and His various transcendental forms.

The word //śruta// in //śrutekṣita-pathaḥ// refers to the //Vedas,// and //īkṣita// indicates that the way to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by proper study of the Vedic scriptures. One cannot imagine something about God or His form. Such imagination is not accepted by those who are serious about enlightenment. Here Brahmā says that one can know Kṛṣṇa through the path of properly understanding the Vedic texts. If by studying the form, name, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead one is attracted to the Lord, he can execute devotional service, and the form of the Lord will be impressed in his heart and remain transcendentally situated there. Unless a devotee actually develops transcendental love for the Lord, it is not possible for him to think always of the Lord within his heart. Such constant thought of the Lord is the sublime perfection of the yogic process, as the //Bhagavad-gītā// confirms in the Sixth Chapter (47), stating that anyone absorbed in such thought is the best of all //yogīs.// Such transcendental absorption is known as //samādhi.// A pure devotee who is always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the person qualified to see the Lord.

One cannot speak of Urugāya (the Lord, who is glorified by sublime prayers) unless one is transcendentally elevated. The Lord has innumerable forms, as the //Brahma-saṁhitā// confirms (//advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam//). The Lord expands Himself in innumerable //svāṁśa// forms. When a devotee, hearing about these innumerable forms, becomes attached to one and always thinks of Him, the Lord appears to him in that form. Lord Kṛṣṇa is especially pleasing to devotees in whose heart He is always present because of their highly elevated transcendental love.
