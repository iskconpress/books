===== Purport =====

A //manv-antara// is the period controlled by one Manu. The reign of fourteen Manus equals the length of one day (twelve hours) in the life of Brahmā, and the night of Brahmā is of the same duration. These calculations are given in the authentic astronomy book known as the //Sūrya-siddhānta.// This book was compiled by the great professor of astronomy and mathematics Bimal Prasād Datta, later known as Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī, who was our merciful spiritual master. He was honored with the title Siddhānta Sarasvatī for writing a commentary on the //Sūrya-siddhānta,// and the title Gosvāmī Mahārāja was added when he accepted //sannyāsa,// the renounced order of life.
