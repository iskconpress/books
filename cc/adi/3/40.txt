In this Age of Kali the practical system of religion for everyone is the chanting of the name of Godhead. This was introduced in this age by Lord Caitanya. //Bhakti-yoga// actually begins with the chanting of the holy name, as confirmed by Madhvācārya in his commentary on the //Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad.// He quotes this verse from the //Nārāyaṇa-saṁhitā://

> dvāparīyair janair viṣṇuḥ
> pañcarātrais tu kevalaiḥ
> kalau tu nāma-mātreṇa
> pūjyate bhagavān hariḥ

"In the Dvāpara-yuga people should worship Lord Viṣṇu only by the regulative principles of the //Nārada-pañcarātra// and other such authorized books. In the Age of Kali, however, people should simply chant the holy names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." The Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is specifically mentioned in many //Upaniṣads,// such as the //Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad,// where it is said:

> hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa
> kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare
> hare rāma hare rāma
> rāma rāma hare hare

> iti ṣoḍaśakaṁ nāmnāṁ
> kali-kalmaṣa-nāśanam
> nātaḥ parataropāyaḥ
> sarva-vedeṣu dṛśyate

"After searching through all the Vedic literature one cannot find a method of religion more sublime for this age than the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa."
