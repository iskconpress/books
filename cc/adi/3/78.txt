Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the father and inaugurator of the //saṅkīrtana// movement. One who worships Him by sacrificing his life, money, intelligence and words for the //saṅkīrtana// movement is recognized by the Lord and endowed with His blessings. All others may be said to be foolish, for of all sacrifices in which a man may apply his energy, a sacrifice made for the //saṅkīrtana// movement is the most glorious.
