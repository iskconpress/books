===== Purport =====

The word //pāṣaṇḍa// is very significant here. One who compares the Supreme Personality of Godhead to the demigods is known as a //pāṣaṇḍa. Pāṣaṇḍas// try to bring the Supreme Lord down to a mundane level. Sometimes they create their own imaginary God or accept an ordinary person as God and advertise him as equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are so foolish that they present someone as the next incarnation of Lord Caitanya or Kṛṣṇa although His activities are all contradictory to those of a genuine incarnation, and thus they fool the innocent public. One who is intelligent and who studies the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with reference to the Vedic context cannot be bewildered by the //pāṣaṇḍas.//

Pāṣaṇḍas, or atheists, cannot understand the pastimes of the Supreme Lord or transcendental loving service to the Lord. They think that devotional service is no better than ordinary fruitive activities (//karma//). As the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:8|(Bg. 4.8)]] confirms, however, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, saving the righteous and chastising the miscreants (//paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām//), always curb these nonsensical atheists. Miscreants always want to deny the Supreme Personality of Godhead and put stumbling blocks in the path of devotional service. The Lord sends His bona fide representatives and appears Himself to curb this nonsense.
