It is sometimes said that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not approve of the acceptance of the //sannyāsa// order in this Kali-yuga because in the //śāstra// it is said:

> aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ
> sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam
> devareṇa sutotpattiṁ
> kalau pañca vivarjayet

"In this Kali-yuga the performance of the //aśvamedha-yajña// or //gomedha-yajña,// sacrifices in which a horse or cow is offered, should be avoided, as should the acceptance of //sannyāsa,// the renounced order of life." (//Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa, Kṛṣṇa-janma-khaṇḍa// 185.180)

Nevertheless we see that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself accepted //sannyāsa// and approved of the //sannyāsa of// His elder brother, Viśvarūpa. It is clearly said here, //bhāla haila,---viśvarūpa sannyāsa karila pitṛ-kula, mātṛ-kula,---dui uddhārila.// Therefore, should it be thought that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made statements that are contradictory? No, actually He did not. It is recommended that one accept //sannyāsa// to dedicate his life for the service of the Lord, and everyone must take that kind of //sannyāsa,// for by accepting such //sannyāsa// one renders the best service to both his paternal and maternal families. But one should not accept the //sannyāsa// order of the Māyāvāda school, which has practically no meaning. We find many Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// simply loitering in the street thinking themselves Brahman or Nārāyaṇa and spending all day and night begging so they can fill their hungry bellies. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// have become so degraded that there is a section of them who eat everything, just like hogs and dogs. It is such degraded //sannyāsa// that is prohibited in this age. Actually, Śrīla Śaṅkarācārya's principles for the acceptance of //sannyāsa// were very strict, but later the so-called Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// became degraded because of their false philosophy, which propounds that by accepting //sannyāsa// one becomes Nārāyaṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected that kind of //sannyāsa.// But the acceptance of //sannyāsa// is one of the items of the //varṇāśrama-dharma.// How then can it be rejected?
