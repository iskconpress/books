===== Purport =====

It is a prejudice amongst //smārta-brāhmaṇas// that a widow must observe fasting on Ekādaśī but a woman who has her husband should not. It appears that before the request of Lord Caitanya Śacīmātā was not observing Ekādaśī because of her being //sa-dhava,// which means that her husband was living. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, introduced the system that a woman, even if not a widow, must observe the Ekādaśī day and must not touch any kind of grains, even those offered to the Deity of Viṣṇu.
