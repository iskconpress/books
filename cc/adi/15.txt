~~Title:Cc. Ādi 15: The Lord’s Paugaṇḍa-līlā~~

====== The Lord’s Paugaṇḍa-līlā =====

A synopsis of the Fifteenth Chapter is as follows. The Lord took lessons in grammar from Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita and became very expert in commenting upon grammar. He forbade His mother to take grains on the Ekādaśī day. He narrated a story that Viśvarūpa, after accepting the //sannyāsa// order, invited Him in a dream to accept //sannyāsa// also, but the Lord refused and was therefore sent back home. When Jagannātha Miśra passed away, the Lord married the daughter of Vallabhācārya, whose name was Lakṣmī. All these events are summarized in this chapter.

  ; [[.15:1|Cc. Ādi 15.1]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya because simply by offering a sumanas flower at His lotus feet even the most ardent materialist becomes a devotee.

  ; [[.15:2|Cc. Ādi 15.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.15:3|Cc. Ādi 15.3]]
  : Let me now enumerate the activities of the Lord between the ages of five and ten. His chief occupation during this period was to engage Himself in study.

  ; [[.15:4|Cc. Ādi 15.4]]
  : The pastimes of the Lord during His paugaṇḍa age were very extensive. His education was His chief occupation, and after that His very beautiful marriage took place.

  ; [[.15:5|Cc. Ādi 15.5]]
  : When the Lord was studying grammar at the place of Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, He would immediately learn grammatical rules and definitions by heart simply by hearing them once.

  ; [[.15:6|Cc. Ādi 15.6]]
  : He soon became so expert in commenting on the Pañjī-ṭīkā that He could win victory over all the other students, although He was a neophyte.

  ; [[.15:7|Cc. Ādi 15.7]]
  : In his book Caitanya-maṅgala [which later became Caitanya-bhāgavata], Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura very elaborately described the Lord's pastimes of study.

  ; [[.15:8|Cc. Ādi 15.8]]
  : One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell down at the feet of His mother and requested her to give Him one thing in charity.

  ; [[.15:9|Cc. Ādi 15.9]]
  : His mother replied, "My dear son, I will give You whatever You ask." Then the Lord said, "My dear mother, please do not eat grains on the Ekādaśī day."

  ; [[.15:10|Cc. Ādi 15.10]]
  : Mother Śacī said, "You have spoken very nicely. I shall not eat grains on Ekādaśī." From that day, she began to observe fasting on Ekādaśī.

  ; [[.15:11|Cc. Ādi 15.11]]
  : Thereafter, seeing that Viśvarūpa was a grown-up youth, Jagannātha Miśra wanted to find a girl and arrange a marriage ceremony for Him.

  ; [[.15:12|Cc. Ādi 15.12]]
  : Hearing of this, Viśvarūpa immediately left home and went away to accept sannyāsa and travel from one place of pilgrimage to another.

  ; [[.15:13|Cc. Ādi 15.13]]
  : When Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra heard of the departure of their elder son, Viśvarūpa, they were very unhappy, but Lord Caitanya tried to console them.

  ; [[.15:14|Cc. Ādi 15.14]]
  : "My dear mother and father," the Lord said, "it is very good that Viśvarūpa has accepted the sannyāsa order, for thus He has delivered both His father's family and His mother's family."

  ; [[.15:15|Cc. Ādi 15.15]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu assured His parents that He would serve them, and thus the minds of His father and mother were satisfied.

  ; [[.15:16|Cc. Ādi 15.16]]
  : One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate betel nuts offered to the Deity, but they acted as an intoxicant, and He fell down on the ground unconscious.

  ; [[.15:17|Cc. Ādi 15.17]]
  : After His father and mother sprinkled water on His mouth with great haste, the Lord revived and said something wonderful they had never heard before.

  ; [[.15:18|Cc. Ādi 15.18]]
  : The Lord said, "Viśvarūpa took Me away from here, and He requested Me to accept the sannyāsa order.

  ; [[.15:19|Cc. Ādi 15.19]]
  : "I replied to Viśvarūpa, 'I have My helpless father and mother, and also I am but a child. What do I know about the sannyāsa order of life?

  ; [[.15:20|Cc. Ādi 15.20]]
  : " 'Later I shall become a householder and thus serve My parents, for this action will very much satisfy Lord Nārāyaṇa and His wife, the goddess of fortune.'

  ; [[.15:21|Cc. Ādi 15.21]]
  : "Then Viśvarūpa returned Me home and requested, 'Offer thousands and thousands of obeisances unto My mother, Śacīdevī.' "

  ; [[.15:22|Cc. Ādi 15.22]]
  : In this way Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed various pastimes, but why He did so I cannot understand.

  ; [[.15:23|Cc. Ādi 15.23]]
  : After some days, Jagannātha Miśra passed away from this world to the transcendental world, and both mother and son were very much aggrieved in their hearts.

  ; [[.15:24|Cc. Ādi 15.24]]
  : Friends and relatives came there to pacify both Lord Caitanya and His mother. Then Lord Caitanya, even though He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, executed the rituals for His dead father according to the Vedic system.

  ; [[.15:25|Cc. Ādi 15.25]]
  : After some days the Lord thought, "I did not take sannyāsa, and since I am remaining at home it is My duty to act as a gṛhastha.

  ; [[.15:26|Cc. Ādi 15.26]]
  : "Without a wife," Lord Caitanya considered, "there is no meaning to householder life." Thus the Lord decided to marry.

  ; [[.15:27|Cc. Ādi 15.27]]
  : "Merely a house is not a home, for it is a wife who gives a home its meaning. If one lives at home with his wife, together they can fulfill all the interests of human life."

  ; [[.15:28|Cc. Ādi 15.28]]
  : One day when the Lord was coming back from school He accidentally saw the daughter of Vallabhācārya on the way to the Ganges.

  ; [[.15:29|Cc. Ādi 15.29]]
  : When the Lord and Lakṣmīdevī met, their relationship awakened, having already been settled, and coincidentally the marriage-maker Vanamālī came to see Śacīmātā.

  ; [[.15:30|Cc. Ādi 15.30]]
  : Following the indications of Śacīdevī, Vanamālī Ghaṭaka arranged the marriage, and thus in due course the Lord married Lakṣmīdevī.

  ; [[.15:31|Cc. Ādi 15.31]]
  : Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has elaborately described all these pastimes of the Lord's early age. What I have given is but a condensed presentation of the same pastimes.

  ; [[.15:32|Cc. Ādi 15.32]]
  : The Lord performed many varieties of pastimes in His early age, and Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has described them elaborately.

  ; [[.15:33|Cc. Ādi 15.33]]
  : I have given but a single hint of these pastimes, for Vrndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, in his book Caitanya-maṅgala [now Caitanya-bhāgavata], has described them all vividly.

  ; [[.15:34|Cc. Ādi 15.34]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
