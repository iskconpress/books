**"His incarnations are of two kinds, namely partial and empowered. He appears in two ages-childhood and boyhood.**

===== Purport =====

The //vilāsa// forms are six in number. Incarnations are of two varieties, namely //śakty-āveśa// (empowered) and //aṁśāveśa// (partial). These incarnations also come within the category of //prābhava// and //vaibhava// manifestations. Childhood and boyhood are two special features of the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but His permanent feature is His eternal form as an adolescent youth. The original Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always worshiped in this eternal adolescent form.
