"According to the intimate relationships between Śrī Kṛṣṇa (the primeval Lord) and His devotees, the //Purāṇas// describe Him by various names. Sometimes He is called Nārāyaṇa; sometimes Upendra (Vāmana), the younger brother of Indra, King of heaven; and sometimes Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Sometimes He is called the thousand-hooded Śeṣa Nāga, and sometimes the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha."
