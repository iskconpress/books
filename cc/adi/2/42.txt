===== Purport =====

The controlling Deities of the living beings in the mundane worlds are the three //puruṣa-avatāras.// But the potent energy displayed by Śrī Kṛṣṇa is far more extensive than that of the //puruṣas.// Śrī Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original father and Lord who protects all creative manifestations through His various plenary portions. Since He sustains even the shelters of the collective living beings, there is no doubt that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Nārāyaṇa.
