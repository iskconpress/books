The three //puruṣas//-Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu-all have a relationship with the material energy, called //māyā,// because through //māyā// They create the material cosmos. These three //puruṣas,// who lie on the Kāraṇa, Garbha and Kṣīra oceans, are the Supersoul of everything that be: Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of the collective universes, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of the collective living beings, and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all individual living entities. Because all of Them are somehow attracted to the affairs of the material energy, They can be said to have some affection for //māyā.// But the transcendental position of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself is not even slightly tinged by //māyā.// His transcendental state is called //turīya,// or the fourth-dimensional stage.
