**“ 'In the material world the Lord is designated as virāṭ, hiraṇyagarbha and kāraṇa. But beyond these three designations, the Lord is ultimately in the fourth dimension.'**

===== Purport =====

The phenomenal manifestation of the Supreme Whole, the numinous soul of everything, and the cause or causal nature are all but designations of the //puruṣas,// who are responsible for material creation. The transcendental position surpasses these designations and is therefore called the position of the fourth dimension. This is a quotation from Śrīdhara Svāmī's commentary on the Eleventh Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, verse 16, of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//
