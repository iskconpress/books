===== Purport =====

Now the author of //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// turns to a description of the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa in His innumerable expansions. The Lord primarily expands Himself in two categories, namely //prābhava// and //vaibhava.// The //prābhava// forms are fully potent like Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the //vaibhava// forms are partially potent. The //prābhava// forms are manifested in relation with potencies, but the //vaibhava// forms are manifested in relation with excellences. The potent //prābhava// manifestations are also of two varieties: temporary and eternal. The Mohinī, Haṁsa and Śukla forms are manifested only temporarily, in terms of a particular age. Among the other //prābhavas,// who are not very famous according to the material estimation, are Dhanvantari, Ṛṣabha, Vyāsa, Dattātreya and Kapila. Among the //vaibhava-prakāśa// forms are Kūrma, Matsya, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, Varāha, Hayagrīva, Pṛśnigarbha, and Baladeva, as well as the //manv-antara avatāras// Yajña, Vibhu, Satyasena, Hari, Vaikuṇṭha, Ajita, Vāmana, Sārvabhauma, Ṛṣabha, Viṣvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhāmā, Yogeśvara and Bṛhadbhānu.
