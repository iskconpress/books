In the verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// cited above [[books:sb:1:2:11|(Bhāg. 1.2.11)]], the principal word, //bhagavān,// indicates the Personality of Godhead, and Brahman and Paramātmā are concomitants deduced from the Absolute Personality, as a government and its ministers are deductions from the supreme executive head. In other words, the principal truth is exhibited in three different phases. The Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa (Bhagavān), is also known as Brahman and Paramātmā, although all these features are identical.
