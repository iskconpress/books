This text from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:4:3:23|(4.3.23)]], spoken by Lord Śiva when he condemned Dakṣa, the father of Satī, as an opponent of Viṣṇu, confirms beyond a doubt that Lord Kṛṣṇa, His name, His fame, His qualities and everything in connection with His paraphernalia exist in the //sandhinī-śakti// of the Lord's internal potency.
