The unadulterated action of the //hlādinī-śakti// is displayed in the dealings of the damsels of Vraja and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, who is the topmost participant in that transcendental group. The essence of the //hlādinī-śakti// is love of Godhead, the essence of love of Godhead is //bhāva,// or transcendental sentiment, and the highest pitch of that //bhāva// is called //mahābhāva.// Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the personified embodiment of these three aspects of transcendental consciousness. She is therefore the highest principle in love of Godhead and is the supreme lovable object of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
