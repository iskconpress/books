Many realized souls, such as Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and King Kulaśekhara, have recommended with great emphasis that one develop this spontaneous love of Godhead, even at the risk of transgressing all the traditional codes of morality and religiosity. Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, one of the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana, has written in his prayers called the //Manaḥ-śikṣā// that one should simply worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa with all attention. //Na dharmaṁ nādharmaṁ śruti-gaṇa-niruktaṁ kila kuru:// one should not be much interested in performing Vedic rituals or simply following rules and regulations.

King Kulaśekhara has written similarly, in his book //Mukunda-mālā-stotra// (5):

> nāsthā dharme na vasu-nicaye naiva kāmopabhoge
> yad bhāvyaṁ tad bhavatu bhagavan pūrva-karmānurūpam
> etat prārthyaṁ mama bahu-mataṁ janma-janmāntare 'pi
> tvat-pādāmbho-ruha-yuga-gatā niścalā bhaktir astu

"I have no attraction for performing religious rituals or holding any earthly kingdom. I do not care for sense enjoyments; let them appear and disappear in accordance with my previous deeds. My only desire is to be fixed in devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord, even though I may continue to take birth here life after life."
