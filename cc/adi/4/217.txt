===== Purport =====

It is said that the //gopīs// are divided into five groups, namely the //sakhīs, nitya-sakhīs, prāṇa-sakhīs, priya-sakhīs// and //parama-preṣṭha-sakhīs.// All these fair-complexioned associates of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the Queen of Vṛndāvana-dhāma, are expert artists in evoking erotic sentiments in Kṛṣṇa. The //parama-preṣṭha-sakhīs// are eight in number, and in the ecstatic dealings of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā they side sometimes with Kṛṣṇa and at other times with Rādhārāṇī, just to create a situation in which it appears that they favor one against the other. That makes the exchange of mellows more palatable.
