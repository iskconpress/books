===== Purport =====

The product of the //hlādinī-śakti// is love of Godhead, which has two divisions-namely, pure love of Godhead and adulterated love of Godhead. Only when the //hlādinī śakti// emanates from Śrī Kṛṣṇa and is bestowed upon the living being to attract Him does the living being become a pure lover of God. But when the same //hlādinī-śakti// is adulterated by the external, material energy and emanates from the living being, it does not attract Kṛṣṇa; on the contrary, the living being becomes attracted by the glamor of the material energy. At that time instead of becoming mad with love of Godhead, the living being becomes mad after material sense enjoyment, and because of his association with the qualitative modes of material nature, he is captivated by its interactions of distressful, unhappy feelings.
