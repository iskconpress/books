//Viṣaya// and //āśraya// are two very significant words relating to the reciprocation between Kṛṣṇa and His devotee. The devotee is called the //āśraya,// and his beloved, Kṛṣṇa, is the //viṣaya.// Different ingredients are involved in the exchange of love between the //āśraya// and //viṣaya,// which are known as //vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika// and //vyabhicārī. Vibhāva// is divided into the two categories //ālambana// and //uddīpana. Ālambana// may be further divided into //āśraya// and //viṣaya.// In the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī is the //āśraya// feature and Kṛṣṇa the //viṣaya.// The transcendental consciousness of the Lord tells Him, "I am Kṛṣṇa, and I experience pleasure as the //viṣaya.// The pleasure enjoyed by Rādhārāṇī, the //āśraya,// is many times greater than the pleasure I feel." Therefore, to feel the pleasure of the //āśraya// category, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
