===== Purport =====

By looking at the beautiful //gopīs// Kṛṣṇa becomes enlivened, and this enlivens the //gopīs,// whose youthful faces and bodies blossom. This competition of increasing beauty between the //gopīs// and Kṛṣṇa, which is without limitations, is so delicate that sometimes mundane moralists mistake these dealings to be purely amorous. But these affairs are not at all mundane, because the //gopīs'// intense desire to satisfy Kṛṣṇa surcharges the entire scene with pure love of Godhead, with not a spot of sexual indulgence.
