===== Purport =====

Lord Kṛṣṇa's father, mother and household affairs are all displayed in the same //viśuddha-sattva// existence. A living entity situated in the status of pure goodness can understand the form, quality and other features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa consciousness begins on the platform of pure goodness. Although there is a faint realization of Kṛṣṇa at first, Kṛṣṇa is actually realized as Vāsudeva, the absolute proprietor of omnipotence or the prime predominating Deity of all potencies. When the living entity is situated in //viśuddha-sattva,// transcendental to the three material modes of nature, he can perceive the form, quality and other features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through his service attitude. The status of pure goodness is the platform of understanding, for the Supreme Lord is always in spiritual existence.

Kṛṣṇa is always all-spiritual. Aside from the parents of the Personality of Godhead, all the other paraphernalia of His existence is also essentially a manifestation of //sandhinī-śakti,// or a transformation of //viśuddha-sattva.// To make this more clear, it may be said that this //sandhinī-śakti// of the internal potency maintains and manifests all the variegatedness of the spiritual world. In the kingdom of God, the Lord's servants and maidservants, His consorts, His father and mother and everything else are all transformations of the spiritual existence of //sandhinī-śakti.// The existential //sandhinī-śakti// in the external potency similarly expands all the variegatedness of the material cosmos, from which we can have a glimpse of the spiritual field.
