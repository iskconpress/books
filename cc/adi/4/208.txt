This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:9:4:67|(9.4.67)]] was spoken by the Lord in connection with the characteristics of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Merging into the existence of the Absolute is as temporary as living in the celestial kingdom. Both of them are controlled by time; neither position is permanent.
