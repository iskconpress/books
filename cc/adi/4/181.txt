===== Purport =====

The selfless love of Godhead exhibited by the //gopīs// cannot have any parallel. We should not, therefore, misunderstand the carefulness of the //gopīs// in their personal decoration. The //gopīs// dressed themselves as beautifully as possible, just to make Kṛṣṇa happy by seeing them. They had no ulterior desires. They dedicated their bodies, and everything they possessed, to the service of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, taking for granted that their bodies were meant for His enjoyment. They dressed themselves on the understanding that Kṛṣṇa would be happy by seeing and touching them.
