In the Fourth Chapter of the //Bhagavad-gītā// Lord Kṛṣṇa affirms that formerly (some 120 million years before the Battle of Kurukṣetra) He explained the mystic philosophy of the //Gītā// to the sun-god. The message was received through the chain of disciplic succession, but in course of time, the chain being broken somehow or other, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared again and taught Arjuna the truths of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// At that time the Lord spoke this verse [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]] to His friend Arjuna.
