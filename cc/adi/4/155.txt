{{description>[The gopīs say:] "O friends, those eyes that see the beautiful faces of the sons of Mahārāja Nanda are certainly fortunate. As these two sons enter the forest, surrounded by Their friends, driving the cows before Them, They hold Their flutes to Their mouths and glance lovingly upon the residents of Vṛndāvana. For those who have eyes, we think there is no greater object of vision."}}

Like the //gopīs,// one can see Kṛṣṇa continuously if one is fortunate enough. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said that sages whose eyes have been smeared with the ointment of pure love can see the form of Śyāmasundara (Kṛṣṇa) continuously in the centers of their hearts. This text from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.21.7) was sung by the //gopīs// on the advent of the //śarat// season.
