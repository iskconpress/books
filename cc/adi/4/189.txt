**For this contradiction I see only one solution: the joy of the gopīs lies in the joy of their beloved Kṛṣṇa.**

===== Purport =====

The situation of the //gopīs// is perplexing, for although they did not want personal happiness, it was imposed upon them. The solution to this perplexity is that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's sense of happiness is limited by the happiness of the //gopīs.// Devotees at Vṛndāvana therefore try to serve the //gopīs,// namely Rādhārāṇī and Her associates. If one gains the favor of the //gopīs,// he easily gains the favor of Kṛṣṇa because on the recommendation of the //gopīs// Kṛṣṇa at once accepts the service of a devotee. Lord Caitanya, therefore, wanted to please the //gopīs// instead of Kṛṣṇa. But His contemporaries misunderstood Him, and for this reason Lord Caitanya renounced the order of householder life and became a //sannyāsī.//
