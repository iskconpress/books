Kṛṣṇa was never ungrateful to the //gopīs,// for as He declares to Arjuna in this verse from the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]], He reciprocates with His devotees in proportion to the transcendental loving service they render unto Him. Everyone follows the path that leads toward Him, but there are different degrees of progress on that path, and the Lord is realized in proportion to one's advancement. The path is one, but the progress in approaching the ultimate goal is different, and therefore the proportion of realization of this goal-namely the absolute Personality of Godhead-is also different. The //gopīs// attained the highest goal, and Lord Caitanya affirmed that there is no higher method of worshiping God than that followed by the //gopīs.//
