===== Translation =====

**The love of the gopīs is called rūḍha-bhāva. It is pure and spotless. It is not at any time lust.**

===== Purport =====

As already explained, the position of the //gopīs// in their loving dealings with Kṛṣṇa is transcendental. Their emotion is called //rūḍha-bhāva.// Although it is apparently like mundane sex, one should not confuse it with mundane sexual love, for it is pure and unadulterated love of Godhead.
