The activities of the //samvit-śakti// produce the effect of cognition. Both the Lord and the living entities are cognizant. Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has full knowledge of everything everywhere, and therefore there are no hindrances to His cognition. He can have knowledge merely by glancing over an object, whereas innumerable impediments block the cognition of ordinary living beings. The cognition of the living beings has three divisions: direct knowledge, indirect knowledge and perverted knowledge. Sense perception of material objects by the mundane senses, such as the eye, ear, nose and hand, always produces definitely perverted knowledge. This illusion is a presentation of the material energy, which is influenced by the //samvit-śakti// in a perverted manner. Negative cognition of an object beyond the reach of sense perception is the way of indirect knowledge, which is not altogether imperfect but which produces only fragmentary knowledge in the form of impersonal spiritual realization and monism. But when the //samvit// factor of cognition is enlightened by the //hlādinī// potency of the same internal energy, they work together, and only thus can one attain knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. The //samvit-śakti// should be maintained in that state. Material knowledge and indirect spiritual knowledge are by-products of the //samvit-śakti.//
