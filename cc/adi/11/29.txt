The //Caitanya-bhāgavata// states that Parameśvara dāsa, known sometimes as Parameśvarī dāsa, was the life and soul of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. The body of Parameśvara dāsa was the place of Lord Nityānanda's pastimes. Parameśvara dāsa, who lived for some time at Khaḍadaha village, was always filled with the ecstasy of a cowherd boy. Formerly he was Arjuna, a friend of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. He was the fifth among the twelve //gopālas.// He accompanied Śrīmatī Jāhnavā-devī when she performed the festival at Kheturi. It is stated in the //Bhakti-ratnākara// that by the order of Śrīmatī Jāhnavā-mātā, he installed Rādhā-Gopīnātha in the temple at Āṭapura in the district of Hugalī. The Āṭapura station is on the narrow-gauge railway line between Howrah and Āmatā. Another temple in Āṭapura, established by the Mitra family, is known as the Rādhā-Govinda temple. In front of the temple, in a very attractive place among two //bakula// trees and a //kadamba// tree, is the tomb of Parameśvarī Ṭhākura, and above it is an altar with a //tulasī// bush. It is said that only one flower a year comes out of the //kadamba// tree. It is offered to the Deity.

Parameśvarī Ṭhākura belonged, it is said, to a //vaidya// family. A descendant of his brother's is at present a worshiper in the temple. Some of their family members still reside in the district of Hugalī, near the post office of Caṇḍītalā. The descendants of Parameśvarī Ṭhākura took many disciples from //brāhmaṇa// families, but as these descendants gradually took to the profession of physicians, persons from //brāhmaṇa// families ceased becoming their disciples. The family titles of Parameśvarī's descendants are Adhikārī and Gupta. Unfortunately, his family members do not worship the Deity directly; they have engaged paid //brāhmaṇas// to worship the Deity. In the temple, Baladeva and Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Gopinātha are together on the throne. It is supposed that the Deity of Baladeva was installed later because according to transcendental mellow, Baladeva, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā cannot stay on the same throne. On the full moon day of Vaiśākha (April-May), the disappearance festival of Parameśvarī Ṭhākura is observed in this temple.
