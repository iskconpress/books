In the //Bhakti-ratnākara// (Twelfth Wave), it is stated that a few miles from Navadvīpa is a place called Śāligrāma that was the residence of Sūryadāsa Sarakhela. He was employed as a secretary in the Muslim government of that time, and thus he amassed a good fortune. Sūryadāsa had four brothers, all of whom were pure Vaiṣṇavas. Vasudhā and Jāhnavā were two daughters of Sūryadāsa Sarakhela.
