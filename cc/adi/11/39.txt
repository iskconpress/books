Sadāśiva Kavirāja and Nāgara Puruṣottama, who were father and son, are described in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// as //mahā-bhāgyavān,// greatly fortunate. They belonged to the //vaidya// caste of physicians. The //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 156, says that Candrāvalī, a most beloved //gopī// of Kṛṣṇa's, later took birth as Sadāśiva Kavirāja. In verses 194 and 200 it is said that Kaṁsāri Sena, the father of Sadāśiva Kavirāja, was formerly the //gopī// named Ratnāvalī in Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. All the family members of Sadāśiva Kavirāja were great devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Puruṣottama dāsa Ṭhākura sometimes lived at Sukhasāgara, near the Cākadaha and Śimurāli railway stations. All the Deities installed by Puruṣottama Ṭhākura were formerly situated in Beleḍāṅgā-grāma, but when the temple was destroyed the Deities were brought to Sukhasāgara. When that temple merged into the bed of the Ganges, the Deities were brought with Jāhnavā-mātā's Deity to Sāhebaḍāṅgā Beḍigrāma. Since that place also has been destroyed, all the Deities are now situated in the village named Cānduḍe-grāma, which is situated one mile up from Pālapāḍā, as referred to above.
