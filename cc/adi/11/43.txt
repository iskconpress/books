The three brothers Viṣṇudāsa, Nandana and Gaṅgādāsa were residents of Navadvīpa and belonged to the Bhaṭṭācārya //brāhmaṇa// family. Both Viṣṇudāsa and Gaṅgādāsa stayed for some time with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī, and the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// states that formerly Nityānanda Prabhu stayed at their house.
