In the last line of the verse quoted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the letter //bha// is repeated many times, as in the words //bhavānī, bhartur, vibhavati// and //adbhuta.// Such repetition is called //anuprāsa,// or alliteration. The words //lakṣmīr iva// and //viṣṇoś caraṇa-kamalotpatti// are instances of //upamā-alaṅkāra,// for they exhibit metaphorical beauty. The Ganges is water, and Lakṣmī is the goddess of fortune. Since water and a person are not actually similar, the comparison is metaphorical.
