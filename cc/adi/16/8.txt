**After some days the Lord went to East Bengal, and wherever He went He introduced the saṅkīrtana movement.**

===== Purport =====

Although Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees in disciplic succession can defeat all kinds of learned scholars, scientists and philosophers in arguments, thus establishing the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead, their main business as preachers is to introduce //saṅkīrtana// everywhere. Simply to defeat scholars and philosophers is not the occupation of a preacher. Preachers must simultaneously introduce the //saṅkīrtana// movement, for that is the mission of the Caitanya cult.
