===== Purport =====

When Tapana Miśra met Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Caitanya was living in household life, and there was no indication that in the future He would accept the //sannyāsa// order. But by asking Tapana Miśra to go to Vārāṇasī He indicated that in the future He would accept //sannyāsa// and that when He would teach Sanātana Gosvāmī, Tapana Miśra would take advantage of the opportunity to learn the object of life and the real process of attaining it.
