In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:5:11|(1.5.11)]] it is said:

> tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavo

> śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ

"In explaining the glories of the Lord, inexperienced men may compose poetry with many faults, but because it contains glorification of the Lord, great personalities read it, hear it and chant it." Despite its minute literary discrepancies, one must study poetry on the merit of its subject matter. According to Vaiṣṇava philosophy, any literature that glorifies the Lord, whether properly written or not, is first class. There need be no other considerations. The poetic compositions of Bhavabhūti, or Śrīkaṇṭha, include //Mālatī-mādhava, Uttara-carita, Vīra-carita// and many other similar Sanskrit dramas. This great poet was born during the time of Bhojarāja as the son of Nīlakaṇṭha, a //brāhmaṇa.// Kālidāsa flourished during the time of Mahārāja Vikramāditya, and he became the state poet. He composed some thirty or forty Sanskrit dramas, including //Kumāra-sambhava, Abhijñāna-śakuntala// and //Megha-dūta.// His drama //Raghu-vaṁśa// is especially famous. We have already described Jayadeva in Chapter Thirteen of this //Ādi-līlā.//
