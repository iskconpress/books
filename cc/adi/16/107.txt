===== Purport =====

The same process advocated by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in His teachings of the//Bhagavad-gītā// as it is---"Surrender unto Me in all instances"---was advocated by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The champion surrendered unto the Lord, and the Lord favored him. One who is favored by the Lord is freed from material bondage, as stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]: //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna.//
