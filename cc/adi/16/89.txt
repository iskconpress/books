===== Purport =====

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly said that all intelligence comes from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. The Paramātmā gave the //paṇḍita// the intelligence to understand that because he was proud of his learning and wanted to defeat even the Supreme Lord, by the will of the Lord and through the agency of mother Sarasvatī he had been defeated. One should not, therefore, be too proud of one's position. Even if one is a greatly learned scholar, if he commits an offense to the lotus feet of the Lord he will not be able to speak properly, in spite of his learning. In every respect, we are controlled. Our only duty, therefore, is to surrender always to the lotus feet of the Lord and not be falsely proud. Mother Sarasvatī created this situation to favor the champion //paṇḍita// so that he might surrender unto Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
