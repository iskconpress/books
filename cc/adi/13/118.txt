On the fifth day from the birth of a child, as also on the ninth day, the mother bathes either in the Ganges or in a sacred place. This is called //niṣkrāmaṇa,// or the ceremony of coming out of the maternity home. Nowadays the maternity home is a hospital, but formerly in every respectable house one room was set aside as a maternity home where children would take birth, and on the ninth day after the birth of a child the mother would come into the regular rooms in the ceremony called //niṣkrāmaṇa.// Of the ten purificatory processes, //niṣkrāmaṇa// is one. Formerly, especially in Bengal, the higher castes observed four months after the birth of a child as a quarantine. At the end of the fourth month, the mother first had to see the sun rise. Later the higher castes, namely, the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas,// observed only twenty-one days as a quarantine, whereas the //śūdras// had to observe thirty days. For the sections of society known as //kartābhajā// and //satīmā,// the mother of the child was immediately purified after the quarantine by the throwing of //hari-nuṭa,// small pieces of sweetmeat, in //saṅkīrtana.// Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra, with the newly born child, were honored by Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī. Similarly, while Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī was returning home, she was also honored by Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra. That was the system in respectable families of Bengal.
