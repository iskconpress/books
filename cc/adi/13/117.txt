Ḍākinī and Śāṅkhinī are two companions of Lord Śiva and his wife who are supposed to be extremely inauspicious, having been born of ghostly life. It is believed that such inauspicious living creatures cannot go near a //nima// tree. At least medically it is accepted that //nima// wood is extremely antiseptic, and formerly it was customary to have a //nima// tree in front of one's house. On very large roads in India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, there are hundreds and thousands of //nima// trees. //Nima// wood is so antiseptic that the Āyurvedic science uses it to cure leprosy. Medical scientists have extracted the active principle of the //nima// tree, which is called margosic acid. //Nima// is used for many purposes, especially to brush the teeth. In Indian villages ninety percent of the people use //nima// twigs for this purpose. Because of all the antiseptic effects of the //nima// tree and because Lord Caitanya was born beneath a //nima// tree, Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī gave the Lord the name Nimāi. Later in His youth He was celebrated as Nimāi Paṇḍita, and in the neighborhood villages He was called by that name, although His real name was Viśvambhara.
