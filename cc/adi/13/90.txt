**According to the Jyotir-veda, or Vedic astronomy, when the figure of the lion appears both in the zodiac and the time of birth [lagna], this indicates a very high conjunction of planets, an area under the influence of ṣaḍ-varga and aṣṭa-varga, which are all-auspicious moments.**

The divisions of the //ṣaḍ-varga// area are technically called //kṣetra, horā, drekkāṇa, navāṁśa, dvādaśāṁśa// and //triṁśāṁśa.// According to Jyotir-vedic astrology, when it is calculated who rules the constellation of six areas, the auspicious moment is calculated. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who was previously also a great astrologer, says that in the book named //Bṛhaj-jātaka// and other books there are directions for knowing the movements of the stars and planets. One who knows the process of drawing a straight line and thus understands the area of //aṣṭa-varga// can explain the auspicious constellations. This science is known especially by persons who are called //horā-śāstra-vit,// or those who know the scripture of the name //Horā.// On the strength of astrological calculations from the //Horā// scripture, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, ascertained the auspicious moment in which the Lord would appear.
