Viśvarūpa was the elder brother of Gaurahari, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When arrangements were being made for His marriage, He took //sannyāsa// and left home. He took the //sannyāsa// name of Śaṅkarāraṇya. In 1431 Śakābda Era (A.D. 1510), He disappeared in Pāṇḍerapura in the district of Sholapur. As an incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, He is both the ingredient and immediate cause of the creation of this material world. He is nondifferent from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as //aṁśa// and //aṁśī,// or the part and the whole, are not different. He belongs to the quadruple manifestation of //catur-vyūha// as an incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa. In the //Gaura-candrodaya// it is said that Viśvarūpa, after His so-called demise, remained mixed within Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu.
