Just as a condemned person can be relieved by a special favor of the chief executive head, the president or king, so the condemned people of this Kali-yuga can be delivered only by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself or a person especially empowered for this purpose. Śrīla Advaita Ācārya Prabhu desired that the Supreme Personality of Godhead advent Himself to deliver the fallen souls of this age.
