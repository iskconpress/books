When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a newly born baby, He was visited by the neighboring ladies, most of whom were the wives of respectable //brāhmaṇas.// In the dress of //brāhmaṇas'// wives, celestial ladies like the wives of Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva also came to see the newly born child. Ordinary people saw them as respectable //brāhmaṇa// ladies of the neighborhood, but actually they were all celestial ladies dressed in that way.
