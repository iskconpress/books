//Tulasī// leaves and Ganges water, with, if possible, a little pulp of sandalwood, is sufficient paraphernalia to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā://

> patraṁ puspaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
> yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
> tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam
> aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ

"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it." [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]] Following this principle, Advaita Prabhu pleased the Supreme personality of Godhead with //tulasī// leaves and water of the Ganges.
