===== Translation =====

**Taking on my head as my own property the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Ācārya Advaitacandra, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, have thus described the advent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda, Advaita Prabhu, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa and their followers are all accepted by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Kavirāja Gosvāmī also accepts the lotus feet of the above-mentioned lords as his personal property. For a materialistic person, material wealth and opulence are only illusory. Actually they are not possessions but entanglements because by enjoying the material world a conditioned soul becomes more and more entangled by incurring debts for his present enjoyment. Unfortunately, a conditioned soul considers property for which he is in debt to be his own, and he is very busy acquiring such property. But a devotee considers such property not real property but simply an entanglement in the material world. If Lord Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased with a devotee, He takes away his material property, as stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.88.8), where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, //yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ.// "To show special favor to a devotee, I take away all his material property." Similarly, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says:

> dhana mora nityānanda, rādhā-kṛṣṇa-śrīcaraṇa
> sei mora prāṇadhana

"My real riches are Nityānanda Prabhu and the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa." He further prays, "O Lord, kindly give me this opulence. I do not want anything but Your lotus feet as my property." Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung in many places that his real property is the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately we are interested in unreal property and are neglecting our real property (//adhane yatana kari' dhana teyāginu//).

Sometimes //smārtas// consider Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī a //śūdra.// But Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī here especially mentions //svarūpa-rūpa-raghunāthadāsa.// Therefore one who considers the lotus feet of Raghunātha dāsa to be transcendental to all divisions of the caste system enjoys the riches of actual spiritual bliss.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līla,  Thirteenth Chapter, describing the advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.//
