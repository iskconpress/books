===== Purport =====

It appears that Advaita Ācārya had two different houses, one at Śāntipura and one at Navadvīpa. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born, Advaita Ācārya was residing not at His Navadvīpa house but at His Śāntipura house. Therefore, as formerly explained (text 99), from Advaita's old paternal house in Śāntipura (//nijālaya//)Sītā came to Navadvīpa to present gifts to the newly born child, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
