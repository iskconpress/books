Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore everyone offered their respects to Him. Even the denizens of heaven used to come in the dress of ordinary men to offer their respect to the Lord. His father and mother, Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīdevī, seeing the honor of their transcendental son, also became very much pleased within their hearts.
