Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement follows this principle. We do not recognize any method for spiritual realization other than Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service. Sometimes we are criticized by groups following //jñāna, yoga, tapas// or //dharma,// but fortunately we are unable to make any compromises with them. We simply stand on the platform of devotional service and preach the same principles all over the world.
