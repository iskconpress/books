~~Title:Cc. Ādi 13: The Advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu~~

====== The Advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu =====

This Thirteenth Chapter of //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// describes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance. The entire //Ādi-līlā// section describes Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's household life, and similarly the //Antya-līlā// describes His life in the //sannyāsa// order. Within the //Antya-līlā,// the first six years of His //sannyāsa// life are called //Madhya-līlā.// During this time, Caitanya Mahāprabhu toured southern India, went to Vṛndāvana, returned from Vṛndāvana and preached the //saṅkīrtana// movement.

A learned //brāhmaṇa// named Upendra Miśra who resided in the district of Śrīhaṭṭa was the father of Jagannātha Miśra, who came to Navadvīpa to study under the direction of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī and then settled there after marrying Nīlāmbara Cakravartī's daughter, Śacīdevī. Śrī Śacīdevī gave birth to eight children, all daughters, who died one after another immediately after birth. After her ninth pregnancy, she gave birth to a son, who was named Viśvarūpa. Then, in 1407 Śaka Era (A.D. 1486), on the full moon evening of the month of Phālguna, during the constellation of //siṁha-lagna,// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared as the son of Śrī Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra. After hearing of the birth of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, learned scholars and //brāhmaṇas,// bringing many gifts, came to see the newly born baby. Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, who was a great astrologer, immediately prepared a horoscope, and by astrological calculation he saw that the child was a great personality. This chapter describes the symptoms of this great personality.

  ; [[.13:6|Cc. Ādi 13.6]]
  : Thus I have spoken the preface of Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Now I shall describe Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes in chronological order.

  ; [[.13:7|Cc. Ādi 13.7]]
  : First let me give a synopsis of the Lord's pastimes. Then I shall describe them in detail.

  ; [[.13:8|Cc. Ādi 13.8]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, adventing Himself in Navadvīpa, was visible for forty-eight years, enjoying His pastimes.

  ; [[.13:9|Cc. Ādi 13.9]]
  : In the year 1407 of the Śaka Era (A.D. 1486), Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared, and in the year 1455 (A.D. 1534) He disappeared from this world.

  ; [[.13:10|Cc. Ādi 13.10]]
  : For twenty-four years Lord Caitanya lived in the gṛhastha-āśrama [household life], always engaging in the pastimes of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.

  ; [[.13:11|Cc. Ādi 13.11]]
  : After twenty-four years He accepted the renounced order of life, sannyāsa, and He resided for twenty-four years more at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.13:12|Cc. Ādi 13.12]]
  : Of these last twenty-four years, He spent the first six years continuously touring India, sometimes in South India, sometimes in Bengal and sometimes in Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.13:13|Cc. Ādi 13.13]]
  : For the remaining eighteen years He continuously stayed in Jagannātha Purī. Chanting the nectarean Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, He inundated everyone there in a flood of love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:14|Cc. Ādi 13.14]]
  : The pastimes of His household life are known as ādi-līlā, or the original pastimes. His later pastimes are known as madhya-līlā and antya-līlā, or the middle and final pastimes.

  ; [[.13:15|Cc. Ādi 13.15]]
  : All the pastimes enacted by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His ādi-lilā were recorded in summary form by Murāri Gupta.

  ; [[.13:16|Cc. Ādi 13.16]]
  : His later pastimes [madhya-līlā and āntya-līlā] were recorded in the form of notes by His secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, and thus kept within a book.

  ; [[.13:17|Cc. Ādi 13.17]]
  : By seeing and hearing the notes recorded by these two great personalities, a Vaiṣṇava, a devotee of the Lord, can know these pastimes one after another.

  ; [[.13:18|Cc. Ādi 13.18]]
  : In His original pastimes there are four divisions: bālya, paugaṇḍa, kaiśora and yauvana [childhood, early boyhood, later boyhood and youth ].

  ; [[.13:19|Cc. Ādi 13.19]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto the full-moon evening in the month of Phālguna, an auspicious time full of auspicious symptoms, when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advented Himself with the chanting of the holy name, Hare Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:20|Cc. Ādi 13.20]]
  : On the full-moon evening of the month of Phālguna when the Lord took birth, coincidentally there was also a lunar eclipse.

  ; [[.13:21|Cc. Ādi 13.21]]
  : In jubilation everyone was chanting the holy name of the Lord---"Hari! Hari!"---and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then appeared, after first causing the appearance of the holy name.

  ; [[.13:22|Cc. Ādi 13.22]]
  : At His birth, in His childhood, in His early and later boyhood as well as in His youth, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, under different pleas, induced people to chant the holy name of Hari [the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra].

  ; [[.13:23|Cc. Ādi 13.23]]
  : In His childhood, when the Lord was crying, He would stop immediately upon hearing the holy names Kṛṣṇa and Hari.

  ; [[.13:24|Cc. Ādi 13.24]]
  : All the friendly ladies who came to see the child would chant the holy names, "Hari, Hari!" as soon as the child would cry.

  ; [[.13:25|Cc. Ādi 13.25]]
  : When all the ladies saw this fun, they enjoyed laughing and called the Lord "Gaurahari." Since then, Gaurahari became another of His names.

  ; [[.13:26|Cc. Ādi 13.26]]
  : His childhood lasted until the date of hāte khaḍi, the beginning of His education, and His age from the end of His childhood until He married is called paugaṇḍa.

  ; [[.13:27|Cc. Ādi 13.27]]
  : After His marriage His youth began, and in His youth He induced everyone to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra anywhere and everywhere.

  ; [[.13:28|Cc. Ādi 13.28]]
  : During His paugaṇḍa age He became a serious student and also taught disciples. In this way He used to explain the holy name of Kṛṣṇa everywhere.

  ; [[.13:29|Cc. Ādi 13.29]]
  : When teaching a course in grammar [vyākaraṇa] and explaining it with notes, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His disciples about the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa. All explanations culminated in Kṛṣṇa, and His disciples would understand them very easily. Thus His influence was wonderful.

  ; [[.13:30|Cc. Ādi 13.30]]
  : When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a student, He asked whomever He met to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. In this way He inundated the whole town of Navadvīpa with the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:31|Cc. Ādi 13.31]]
  : Just prior to His youthful life, He began the saṅkīrtana movement. Day and night He used to dance in ecstasy with His devotees.

  ; [[.13:32|Cc. Ādi 13.32]]
  : The saṅkīrtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the Lord wandered everywhere performing kīrtana. In this way He inundated the whole world by distributing love of Godhead.

  ; [[.13:33|Cc. Ādi 13.33]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived in the Navadvīpa area for twenty-four years, and He induced every person to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and thus merge in love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:34|Cc. Ādi 13.34]]
  : For His remaining twenty-four years, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, after accepting the renounced order of life, stayed at Jagannātha Purī with His devotees.

  ; [[.13:35|Cc. Ādi 13.35]]
  : For six of these twenty-four years in Nīlācala [Jagannātha Purī], He distributed love of Godhead by always chanting and dancing.

  ; [[.13:36|Cc. Ādi 13.36]]
  : Beginning from Cape Comorin and extending through Bengal to Vṛndāvana, during these six years He toured all of India, chanting, dancing and distributing love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:37|Cc. Ādi 13.37]]
  : The activities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His travels after He accepted sannyāsa are His principal pastimes. His activities during His remaining eighteen years are called antya-līlā, or the final portion of His pastimes.

  ; [[.13:38|Cc. Ādi 13.38]]
  : For six of the eighteen years He continuously stayed in Jagannātha Purī, He regularly performed kīrtana, inducing all the devotees to love Kṛṣṇa simply by chanting and dancing.

  ; [[.13:39|Cc. Ādi 13.39]]
  : For the remaining twelve years He stayed in Jagannātha Purī, He taught everyone how to taste the transcendental mellow ecstasy of love of Kṛṣṇa by tasting it Himself.

  ; [[.13:40|Cc. Ādi 13.40]]
  : Day and night Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt separation from Kṛṣṇa. Manifesting symptoms of this separation, He cried and talked very inconsistently, like a madman.

  ; [[.13:41|Cc. Ādi 13.41]]
  : As Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī talked inconsistently when She met Uddhava, so also Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished, both day and night, such ecstatic talk in the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

  ; [[.13:42|Cc. Ādi 13.42]]
  : The Lord used to read the books of Vidyāpati, Jayadeva and Caṇḍīdāsa, relishing their songs with His confidential associates like Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.13:43|Cc. Ādi 13.43]]
  : In separation from Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished all these ecstatic activities, and thus He fulfilled His own desires.

  ; [[.13:44|Cc. Ādi 13.44]]
  : The pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu are unlimited. How much can a small living entity elaborate about those transcendental pastimes?

  ; [[.13:45|Cc. Ādi 13.45]]
  : If Śeṣaṇāga Ananta personally were to make the pastimes of Lord Caitanya into //sūtras,// even with His thousands of mouths there is no possibility that He could find their limit.

  ; [[.13:46|Cc. Ādi 13.46]]
  : Devotees like Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Murāri Gupta have recorded all the principal pastimes of Lord Caitanya in the form of notes, after deliberate consideration.

  ; [[.13:47|Cc. Ādi 13.47]]
  : The notes kept by Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Murāri Gupta are the basis of this book. Following those notes, I write of all the pastimes of the Lord. The notes have been described elaborately by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura.

  ; [[.13:48|Cc. Ādi 13.48]]
  : Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, the authorized writer of the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is as good as Śrīla Vyāsadeva. He has described the pastimes in such a way as to make them sweeter and sweeter.

  ; [[.13:49|Cc. Ādi 13.49]]
  : Being afraid of his book's becoming too voluminous, he left some places without vivid descriptions. I shall try to fill those places as far as possible.

  ; [[.13:50|Cc. Ādi 13.50]]
  : The transcendental pastimes of Lord Caitanya have actually been relished by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. I am simply trying to chew the remnants of food left by him.

  ; [[.13:51|Cc. Ādi 13.51]]
  : My dear devotees of Lord Caitanya, let me now write a synopsis of the ādi-līlā; I write of these pastimes in brief because it is not possible to describe them in full.

  ; [[.13:52|Cc. Ādi 13.52]]
  : To fulfill a particular desire within His mind, Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-kumāra, decided to descend on this planet after mature contemplation.

  ; [[.13:53|Cc. Ādi 13.53]]
  : Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore first allowed His family of superiors to descend on the earth. I shall try to describe them in brief because it is not possible to describe them fully.

  ; [[.13:54-55|Cc. Ādi 13.54-55]]
  : Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, before appearing as Lord Caitanya, requested these devotees to precede Him: Śrī Śacīdevī, Jagannātha Miśra, Mādhavendra Purī, Keśava Bhāratī, Īśvara Purī, Advaita Ācārya, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, Ācāryaratna, Vidyānidhi and Ṭhākura Haridāsa.

  ; [[.13:56|Cc. Ādi 13.56]]
  : There was also Śrī Upendra Miśra, a resident of the district of Śrīhaṭṭa. He was a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, a learned scholar, a rich man and a reservoir of all good qualities.

  ; [[.13:57-58|Cc. Ādi 13.57-58]]
  : Upendra Miśra had seven sons, who were all saintly and most influential: (1) Kaṁsāri, (2) Paramānanda, (3) Padmanābha, (4) Sarveśvara, (5) Jagannātha, (6) Janārdana and (7) Trailokyanātha. Jagannātha Miśra, the fifth son, decided to reside on the bank of the Ganges at Nadia.

  ; [[.13:59|Cc. Ādi 13.59]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra was designated as Purandara. Exactly like Nanda Mahārāja and Vasudeva, he was an ocean of all good qualities.

  ; [[.13:60|Cc. Ādi 13.60]]
  : His wife, Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, was a chaste woman highly devoted to her husband. Śacīdevī's father's name was Nīlāmbara, and his surname was Cakravartī.

  ; [[.13:61|Cc. Ādi 13.61]]
  : In Rāḍhadeśa, the part of Bengal where the Ganges is not visible, Nityānanda Prabhu, Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, Murāri Gupta and Mukunda took birth.

  ; [[.13:62|Cc. Ādi 13.62]]
  : Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-kumāra, first caused countless devotees to appear, and at last He appeared Himself.

  ; [[.13:63|Cc. Ādi 13.63]]
  : Before the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the devotees of Navadvīpa used to gather in the house of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.13:64|Cc. Ādi 13.64]]
  : In these meetings of the Vaiṣṇavas, Advaita Ācārya used to recite Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, decrying the paths of philosophical speculation and fruitive activity and establishing the superexcellence of devotional service.

  ; [[.13:65|Cc. Ādi 13.65]]
  : In all the revealed scriptures of Vedic culture, devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is explained throughout. Therefore devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa do not recognize the processes of philosophical speculation, mystic yoga, unnecessary austerity and so-called religious rituals. They do not accept any process but devotional service.

  ; [[.13:66|Cc. Ādi 13.66]]
  : In the house of Advaita Ācārya, all the Vaiṣṇavas took pleasure in always talking of Kṛṣṇa, always worshiping Kṛṣṇa and always chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

  ; [[.13:67|Cc. Ādi 13.67]]
  : But Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu felt pained to see all the people without Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply merging in material sense enjoyment.

  ; [[.13:68|Cc. Ādi 13.68]]
  : Seeing the condition of the world, He began to think seriously of how all these people could be delivered from the clutches of māyā.

  ; [[.13:69|Cc. Ādi 13.69]]
  : Śrīla Advaita Ācārya Prabhu thought, "If Kṛṣṇa Himself appears in order to distribute the cult of devotional service, then only will liberation be possible for all people."

  ; [[.13:70|Cc. Ādi 13.70]]
  : With this consideration, Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, promising to cause Lord Kṛṣṇa to descend, began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, with tulasī leaves and water of the Ganges.

  ; [[.13:71|Cc. Ādi 13.71]]
  : By loud cries He invited Kṛṣṇa to appear, and this repeated invitation attracted Lord Kṛṣṇa to descend.

  ; [[.13:72|Cc. Ādi 13.72]]
  : Before the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, eight daughters took birth one after another from the womb of Śacīmātā, the wife of Jagannātha Miśra. But just after their birth, they all died.

  ; [[.13:73|Cc. Ādi 13.73]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra was very unhappy at the death of his children one after another. Therefore, desiring a son, he worshiped the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu.

  ; [[.13:74|Cc. Ādi 13.74]]
  : After this, Jagannātha Miśra got a son of the name Viśvarūpa, who was most powerful and highly qualified because He was an incarnation of Baladeva.

  ; [[.13:75|Cc. Ādi 13.75]]
  : The expansion of Baladeva known as Saṅkarṣaṇa in the spiritual world is the ingredient and immediate cause of this material cosmic manifestation.

  ; [[.13:76|Cc. Ādi 13.76]]
  : The gigantic universal form is called the Viśvarūpa incarnation of Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa. Thus we do not find anything within this cosmic manifestation except the Lord Himself.

  ; [[.13:77|Cc. Ādi 13.77]]
  : "As the thread in a cloth spreads both lengthwise and breadthwise, so everything we see within this cosmic manifestation is directly and indirectly existing in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is not very wonderful for Him."

  ; [[.13:78|Cc. Ādi 13.78]]
  : Because Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa is the ingredient and efficient cause of the cosmic manifestation, He is present in every detail of it. Lord Caitanya therefore called Him His elder brother. The two brothers are known as Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in the spiritual world, but at the present moment they are Caitanya and Nitāi. Therefore the conclusion is that Nityānanda Prabhu is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa, Baladeva.

  ; [[.13:79|Cc. Ādi 13.79]]
  : The husband and wife [Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā], having gotten Viśvarūpa as their son, were very pleased within their minds. Because of their pleasure, they specifically began to serve the lotus feet of Govinda.

  ; [[.13:80|Cc. Ādi 13.80]]
  : In the month of January in the year 1406 of the Śaka Era (A.D. 1485), Lord Kṛṣṇa entered the bodies of both Jagannātha Miśra and Śacī.

  ; [[.13:81|Cc. Ādi 13.81]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra said to Śacīmātā, "I see wonderful things! Your body is effulgent, and it appears as if the goddess of fortune were now staying personally in my home.

  ; [[.13:82|Cc. Ādi 13.82]]
  : "Anywhere and everywhere I go, all people offer me respect. Even without my asking, they voluntarily give me riches, clothing and paddy."

  ; [[.13:83|Cc. Ādi 13.83]]
  : Śacīmatā told her husband, "I also see wonderfully brilliant human beings appearing in outer space, as if offering prayers."

  ; [[.13:84|Cc. Ādi 13.84]]
  : Jagannātha Miśra then replied, "In a dream I saw the effulgent abode of the Lord enter my heart.

  ; [[.13:85|Cc. Ādi 13.85]]
  : "From my heart it entered your heart. I therefore understand that a great personality will soon take birth."

  ; [[.13:86|Cc. Ādi 13.86]]
  : After this conversation, both husband and wife were very jubilant, and together they rendered service to the household śālagrāma-śilā.

  ; [[.13:87|Cc. Ādi 13.87]]
  : In this way the pregnancy approached its thirteenth month, but still there was no sign of the delivery of the child. Thus Jagannātha Miśra became greatly apprehensive.

  ; [[.13:88|Cc. Ādi 13.88]]
  : Nīlāmbara Cakravartī [the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu] then did an astrological calculation and said that in that month, taking advantage of an auspicious moment, the child would take birth.

  ; [[.13:89|Cc. Ādi 13.89]]
  : Thus in the year 1407 of the Śaka Era (A.D. 1486), in the month of Phālguna [March-April], on the evening of the full moon, the desired auspicious moment appeared.

  ; [[.13:90|Cc. Ādi 13.90]]
  : According to the Jyotir-veda, or Vedic astronomy, when the figure of the lion appears both in the zodiac and the time of birth [lagna], this indicates a very high conjunction of planets, an area under the influence of ṣaḍ-varga and aṣṭa-varga, which are all-auspicious moments.

  ; [[.13:91|Cc. Ādi 13.91]]
  : When the spotless moon of Caitanya Mahāprabhu became visible, what would be the need for a moon full of black marks on its body?

  ; [[.13:92|Cc. Ādi 13.92]]
  : Considering this, Rāhu, the black planet, covered the full moon, and immediately vibrations of "Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa! Hari!" inundated the three worlds.

  ; [[.13:93|Cc. Ādi 13.93]]
  : All people thus chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra during the lunar eclipse, and their minds were struck with wonder.

  ; [[.13:94|Cc. Ādi 13.94]]
  : When the whole world was thus chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa in the form of Gaurahari advented Himself on the earth.

  ; [[.13:95|Cc. Ādi 13.95]]
  : The whole world was pleased. While the Hindus chanted the holy name of the Lord, the non-Hindus, especially the Muslims, jokingly imitated the words.

  ; [[.13:96|Cc. Ādi 13.96]]
  : While all the ladies vibrated the holy name of Hari on earth, in the heavenly planets dancing and music were going on, for the demigods were very curious.

  ; [[.13:97|Cc. Ādi 13.97]]
  : In this atmosphere, all the ten directions became jubilant, as did the waves of the rivers. Moreover, all beings, moving and nonmoving, were overwhelmed with transcendental bliss.

  ; [[.13:98|Cc. Ādi 13.98]]
  : Thus by His causeless mercy the full moon, Gaurahari, rose in the district of Nadia, which is compared to Udayagiri, where the sun first becomes visible. His rising in the sky dissipated the darkness of sinful life, and thus the three worlds became joyful and chanted the holy name of the Lord.

  ; [[.13:99|Cc. Ādi 13.99]]
  : At that time Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, in His own house at Śāntipura, was dancing in a pleasing mood. Taking Haridāsa Ṭhākura with Him, He danced and loudly chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. But why they were dancing, no one could understand.

  ; [[.13:100|Cc. Ādi 13.100]]
  : Seeing the lunar eclipse and laughing, both Advaita Ācārya and Haridāsa Ṭhākura immediately went to the bank of the Ganges and bathed in the Ganges in great jubilation. Taking advantage of the occasion of the lunar eclipse, Advaita Ācārya, by His own mental strength, distributed various types of charity to the brāhmaṇas.

  ; [[.13:101|Cc. Ādi 13.101]]
  : When he saw that the whole world was jubilant, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, his mind astonished, directly and indirectly expressed himself to Advaita Ācārya, "Your dancing and distributing charity are very pleasing to me. I can understand that there is some special purpose in these actions."

  ; [[.13:102|Cc. Ādi 13.102]]
  : Ācāryaratna [Candraśekhara] and Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura were overwhelmed with joy, and immediately they went to the bank of the Ganges to take bath in the water of the Ganges. Their minds full of happiness, they chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and gave charity by mental strength.

  ; [[.13:103|Cc. Ādi 13.103]]
  : In this way all the devotees, wherever they were situated, in every city and every country, danced, performed saṅkīrtana and gave charity by mental strength on the plea of the lunar eclipse, their minds overwhelmed with joy.

  ; [[.13:104|Cc. Ādi 13.104]]
  : All sorts of respectful brāhmaṇa gentlemen and ladies, carrying plates filled with various gifts, came with their presentations. Seeing the newborn child, whose form resembled natural glaring gold, all of them with happiness offered their blessings.

  ; [[.13:105|Cc. Ādi 13.105]]
