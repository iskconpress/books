**If one chants the exalted holy name of the Lord again and again and yet his love for the Supreme Lord does not develop and tears do not appear in his eyes, it is evident that because of his offenses in chanting, the seed of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa does not sprout.**

===== Purport =====

If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// offensively, one does not achieve the desired result. Therefore one should carefully avoid the offenses which have already been described in connection with verse 24.
