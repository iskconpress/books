===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// the transcendental qualities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are mentioned. Among these, fifty are primary (//ayaṁ netā su-ramyāṅgaḥ,// etc.), and in minute quantity they were all present in the body of Śrī Haridāsa Paṇḍita. Since every living entity is a part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all fifty of these good qualities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are originally minutely present in every living being. Due to his contact with material nature, these qualities are not visible in the conditioned soul, but when one becomes a purified devotee, they all automatically manifest themselves. This is stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:18:12|(5.18.12)]], as mentioned in the text below.
