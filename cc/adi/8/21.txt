This is the benefit of Lord Caitanya's movement. If one somehow or other comes in contact with the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, without consideration of his being a //śūdra, vaiśya,// Jagāi, Mādhāi or even lower, he becomes advanced in spiritual consciousness and immediately develops love of Godhead. We now have actual experience that throughout the entire world this movement is making many such persons lovers of God simply by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Actually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has appeared as the spiritual master of the entire world. He does not discriminate between offenders and the innocent. //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te:// He liberally gives love of Godhead to anyone and everyone. This can be actually experienced, as stated in the next verse.
