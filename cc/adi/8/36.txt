//Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// is the authoritative reference book from which to understand devotional service, but because it is very elaborate, few men can understand its purpose. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the original commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra,// which is called //nyāya-prasthāna.// It was written to enable one to understand the Absolute Truth through infallible logic and argument, and therefore its natural commentary, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// is extremely elaborate. Professional reciters have created the impression that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// deals only with Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā,// although Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā// is described only in the Tenth Canto (chapters 29-35). They have in this way presented Kṛṣṇa to the Western world as a great woman-hunter, and therefore we sometimes have to deal with such misconceptions in preaching. Another difficulty in understanding //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is that the professional reciters have introduced //bhāgavata-saptāha,// or seven-day readings of the //Bhāgavatam.// They want to finish //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// in a week, although it is so sublime that even one verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// if properly explained, cannot be completed in three months. Under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's //Caitanya-bhāgavata,// for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said:

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva kalpate

"Devotional service to the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic scriptures like the //Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra,// etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society." Due to misunderstanding //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// people are misled regarding the science of Kṛṣṇa. However, by reading Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's book one can very easily understand this science.
