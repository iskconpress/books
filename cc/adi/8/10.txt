In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.3.51) it is said, //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:// "Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// or Lord Kṛṣṇa's name, one is liberated and goes back home, back to Godhead." This Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be achieved through the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One cannot be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he accepts Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates as the only means for success. It is because of these considerations that the Lord accepted //sannyāsa,// for thus people would offer Him respect and very quickly come to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Since Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, inaugurated the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, without His mercy one cannot be elevated to the transcendental platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
