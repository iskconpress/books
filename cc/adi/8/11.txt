===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He always thinks of how to liberate the conditioned souls from the material platform. It is for this reason that Kṛṣṇa incarnates, as clearly indicated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:7|(Bg. 4.7)]]:

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> abhyutthānam adharmasya
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham

"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion-at that time I descend Myself."Kṛṣṇa always protects the living entities in many ways. He comes Himself, He sends His own confidential devotees, and He leaves behind Him //śāstras// like the //Bhagavad-gītā// Why? It is so that people may take advantage of the benediction to be liberated from the clutches of //māyā.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa// so that even a foolish person who accepted Him as an ordinary //sannyāsī// would offer Him respect, for this would help diminish his material distresses and ultimately liberate him from the material clutches. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī points out in this connection that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the combined form of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa (//mahāprabhu śrī-caitanya, rādha-kṛṣṇa-nahe anya//). Therefore when fools considered Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be an ordinary human being and thus treated Him disrespectfully, the merciful Lord, in order to deliver these offenders, accepted //sannyāsa// so that they would offer Him obeisances, accepting Him as a //sannyāsī.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa// to bestow His great mercy on people in general, who cannot appreciate Him as Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa Themselves.
