If one is seriously interested in Kṛṣṇa conscious activities, he must be ready to follow the rules and regulations laid down by the //ācāryas,// and he must understand their conclusions. The //śāstra// says: //dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ mahā-jano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// (//Mahābhārata, Vana-parva// 313.117). It is very difficult to understand the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but one who advances by the instruction of the previous //ācāryas// and follows in the footsteps of his predecessors in the line of disciplic succession will have success. Others will not. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says in this connection, //chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// "Unless one serves the spiritual master and //ācāryas,// one cannot be liberated." Elsewhere he says:

> ei chaya gosāñi yāra---mui tāra dāsa
> tāṅ' sabāra pada-reṇu mora pañca-grāsa

"I simply accept a person who follows in the footsteps of the six Gosvāmīs, and the dust of such a person's lotus feet is my food."
