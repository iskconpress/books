===== Purport =====

A Vaiṣṇava always follows the order of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// was written by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī by their mercy. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī considered all the devotees that have been mentioned to be his preceptor //gurus,// or spiritual masters, and Madana-gopāla (Śrī Madana-mohana //vigraha//) is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Thus he took permission from both of them, and when he received the mercy of both //guru// and Kṛṣṇa, he was able to write this great literature, //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// This example should be followed. Anyone who attempts to write about Kṛṣṇa must first take permission from the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, and the spiritual master is His direct external representative. Thus Kṛṣṇa is situated //antar-bahiḥ,// within and without. One must first become a pure devotee by following the strict regulative principles and chanting sixteen rounds daily, and when one thinks that he is actually on the Vaiṣṇava platform, he must then take permission from the spiritual master, and that permission must also be confirmed by Kṛṣṇa from within his heart. Then, if one is very sincere and pure, he can write transcendental literature, either prose or poetry.
