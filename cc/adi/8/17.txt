These //ślokas// are to be discussed. Their purport is that one cannot obtain //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// or the devotional service of the Lord, by official execution of the Vedic rituals. One has to approach a pure devotee. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, //chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// "Who has been elevated without rendering service to a pure Vaiṣṇava?" It is the statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja that unless one is able to accept the dust from the lotus feet of a pure Vaiṣṇava there is no possibility of achieving the platform of devotional service. That is the secret. The above-mentioned //tantra-vacana,// quoted from the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.1.36), is our perfect guidance in this connection.
