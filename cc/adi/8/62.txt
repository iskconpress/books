===== Purport =====

It is a qualification of a Vaiṣṇava that he is //adoṣa-darśī:// he never sees others' faults. Of course, every human being has both good qualities and faults. Therefore it is said, //saj-janā guṇam icchanti doṣam icchanti pāmarāḥ:// everyone has a combination of faults and glories. But a Vaiṣṇava, a sober man, accepts only a man's glories and not his faults, for flies seek sores whereas honeybees seek honey. Haridāsa Paṇḍita never found fault with a Vaiṣṇava but considered only his good qualities.
