===== Purport =====

It is very beneficial to chant the names //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda// before chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// because by chanting these two holy names-//śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda//-one immediately becomes ecstatic, and if he then chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// he becomes free of offenses.

There are ten offenses to avoid in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// The first offense is to blaspheme great personalities who are engaged in distributing the holy name of the Lord. It is said in the //śāstra// [[books:cc:antya:7:11|(Cc. Antya 7.11)]], //kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana:// one cannot distribute the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// unless he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore one should not criticize or blaspheme a devotee who is thus engaged.

Śrī Padma Purāṇa states:

> satāṁ nindā nāmnaḥ paramam aparādhaṁ vitanute
> yataḥ khyātiṁ yātaṁ katham u sahate tad-vigarhām

To blaspheme the great saintly persons who are engaged in preaching the glories of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is the worst offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. One should not criticize a preacher of the glories of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// If one does so, he is an offender. The Nāma-prabhu, who is identical with Kṛṣṇa, will never tolerate such blasphemous activities, even from one who passes as a great devotee.

The second //nāmāparādha// is described as follows:

> śivasya śrī-viṣṇor ya iha guṇa-nāmādi-sakalaṁ
> dhiyā bhinnaṁ paśyet sa khalu hari-nāmāhita-karaḥ

In this material world, the holy name of Viṣṇu is all-auspicious. Viṣṇu's name, form, qualities and pastimes are all transcendental, absolute knowledge. Therefore, if one tries to separate the Absolute Personality of Godhead from His holy name or His transcendental form, qualities and pastimes, thinking them to be material, that is offensive. Similarly, to think the names of demigods such as Lord Śiva to be as good as the name of Lord Viṣṇu-or, in other words, to think Lord Śiva and the other demigods to be other forms of God and therefore equal to Viṣṇu-is also blasphemous. This is the second offense at the lotus feet of the Lord.

The third offense at the lotus feet of the holy name, which is called //guror avajñā,// is to consider the spiritual master to be material and therefore envy his exalted position. The fourth offense (//śruti-śāstra-nindanam//) is to blaspheme Vedic scriptures such as the four //Vedas// and the //Puraṇas.// The fifth offense (//artha-vādaḥ//) is to consider the glories of the holy name to be exaggerations. Similarly, the sixth offense (//hari-nāmni kalpanam//) is to consider the holy name of the Lord to be imaginary.

The seventh offense is described as follows:

> nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhir
> na vidyate tasya yamair hi śuddhiḥ

To think that since the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// can counteract all sinful reactions one may therefore go on with his sinful activities and at the same time chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// to neutralize them is the greatest offense at the lotus feet of //hari-nāma.//

The eighth offense is stated thus:

> dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-
> śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ

It is offensive to consider the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// to be a religious ritualistic ceremony. Performing religious ceremonies, following vows and practicing renunciation and sacrifice are all materialistic auspicious activities. The chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// must not be compared to such materialistic religiosity.This is an offense at the lotus feet of the Lord.

The ninth offense is described as follows:

> aśraddadhāne vimukhe 'py aśṛṇvati
> yaś copadeśaḥ śiva-nāmāparādhaḥ

It is an offense to preach the glories of the holy name among persons who have no intelligence or no faith in the subject matter. Such people should be given the chance to hear the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// but in the beginning they should not be instructed about the glories or the spiritual significance of the holy name. By constant hearing of the holy name, their hearts will be purified, and then they will be able to understand the transcendental position of the holy name.

The tenth offense is as follows:

> śrute 'pi nāma-māhātmye yaḥ prīti-rahito naraḥ
> ahaṁ-mamādi-paramo nāmni so 'py aparādha-kṛt

If one has heard the glories of the transcendental holy name of the Lord but nevertheless continues in a materialistic concept of life, thinking "I am this body and everything belonging to this body is mine [//ahaṁ mameti//]," and does not show respect and love for the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// that is an offense.
