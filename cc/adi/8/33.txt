Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's //Caitanya-bhāgavata// was originally entitled //Caitanya-maṅgala,// but when Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura later wrote another book named //Caitanya-maṅgala,// Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura changed the name of his own book, which is now therefore known as //Caitanya-bhāgavata.// The life of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very elaborately described in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata,// and Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has already informed us that in his //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// he has described whatever Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has not mentioned. This acceptance of //Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata// by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī indicates his acceptance of the disciplic succession. A writer of transcendental literature never tries to surpass the previous //ācāryas.//
