===== Purport =====

The //prākṛta-sahajiyās// who chant //nitāi-gaura rādhe śyāma// have very little knowledge of the //Bhāgavata// conclusion, and they hardly follow the Vaiṣṇava rules and regulations, and yet because they chant //bhaja nitāi-gaura,// their chanting immediately invokes tears and other signs of ecstasy. Although they do not know the principles of Vaiṣṇava philosophy and are not very advanced in education, by these symptoms they attract many men to become their followers. Their ecstatic tears will of course help them in the long run, for as soon as they come in contact with a pure devotee their lives will become successful. Even in the beginning, however, because they are chanting the holy names of //nitāi-gaura,// their swift advancement on the path of love of Godhead is very prominently visible.
