Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has written in his //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa://

> avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ
> pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam
> śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ
> sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ

Transcendental literature that strictly follows the Vedic principles and the conclusion of the //Purāṇas// and //pañcarātrika-vidhi// can be written only by a pure devotee.

It is not possible for a common man to write books on //bhakti,// for his writings will not be effective. He may be a very great scholar and expert in presenting literature in flowery language, but this is not at all helpful in understanding transcendental literature. Even if transcendental literature is written in faulty language, it is acceptable if it is written by a devotee, whereas so-called transcendental literature written by a mundane scholar, even if it is a very highly polished literary presentation, cannot be accepted. The secret in a devotee's writing is that when he writes about the pastimes of the Lord, the Lord helps him; he does not write himself. As stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]], //dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te.// Since a devotee writes in service to the Lord, the Lord from within gives him so much intelligence that he sits down near the Lord and goes on writing books. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī confirms that what Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura wrote was actually spoken by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he simply repeated it. The same holds true for //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī wrote //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// in his old age, in an invalid condition, but it is such a sublime scripture that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja used to say, "The time will come when the people of the world will learn Bengali to read //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//" We are trying to present //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// in English and do not know how successful it will be, but if one reads the original //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// in Bengali he will relish increasing ecstasy in devotional service.
