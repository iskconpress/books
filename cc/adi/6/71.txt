This verse is quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.30.39). When the //rāsa// dance was going on in full swing, Kṛṣṇa left all the //gopīs// and took only Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī with Him. At that time all the //gopīs// lamented, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, being proud of Her position, requested Kṛṣṇa to carry Her wherever He liked. Then Kṛṣṇa immediately disappeared from the scene, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī began to lament.
