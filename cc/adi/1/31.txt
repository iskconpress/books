Lord Caitanya is the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa Himself. This is substantiated by evidence from the authentic spiritual scriptures. Sometimes people accept a man as God on the basis of their whimsical sentiments and without reference to the revealed scriptures, but the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// proves all his statements by citing the //śāstras.// Thus he establishes that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
