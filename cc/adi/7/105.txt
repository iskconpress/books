===== Purport =====

In this verse the words //tomāra prabhāve// ("Your influence") are very important. Unless one is spiritually advanced he cannot influence an audience. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, //śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla.// "Unless one associates with a pure devotee he cannot be influenced to understand devotional service." These Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// were fortunate enough to meet the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of a devotee, and certainly they were greatly influenced by the Lord. They knew that since a perfectly advanced spiritualist never says anything false, all his words are reasonable and agree with the Vedic version. A highly realized person never says anything that has no meaning. Māyāvādī philosophers claim to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this has no meaning, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never uttered such nonsense. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// were convinced about His personality, and therefore they wanted to hear from Him the purport of Vedānta philosophy.
