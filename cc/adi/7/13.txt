===== Translation =====

**Śrī Advaita Ācārya is Lord Caitanya's incarnation as a devotee. Therefore these three tattvas [Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Gosāñi] are the predominators, or masters.**

===== Purport =====

//Gosāñi// means //gosvāmī.// A person who has full control over the senses and mind is called a //gosvāmī// or //gosāñi.// One who does not have such control is called //godāsa,// or a servant of the senses, and cannot become a spiritual master. A spiritual master who actually has control over the mind and senses is called //gosvāmī.// Although the //gosvāmī// title has become a hereditary designation for unscrupulous men, actually the title //gosāñi,// or //gosvāmī,// began from Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, who presented himself as an ordinary //gṛhastha// and minister in government service but became //gosvāmī// when he was actually elevated by the instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore //gosvāmī// is not a hereditary title but refers to one's qualifications. When one is highly elevated in spiritual advancement, regardless of wherefrom he comes, he may be called //gosvāmī.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Gosāñi Prabhu are natural //gosvāmīs// because They belong to the //viṣṇu-tattva// category. As such, all of Them are //prabhus// ("predominators" or "masters"), and They are sometimes called Caitanya Gosāñi, Nityānanda Gosāñi and Advaita Gosāñi. Unfortunately Their so-called descendants who do not have the qualifications of //gosvāmīs// have accepted this title as a hereditary designation or a professional degree. That is not in accord with the śāstric injunctions.
