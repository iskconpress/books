The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not stereotyped or stagnant. It will spread all over the world in spite of all objections by fools and rascals that European and American //mlecchas// cannot be accepted as //brāhmaṇas// or //sannyāsīs.// Here it is indicated that this process will spread and inundate the entire world with Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
