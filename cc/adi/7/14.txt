Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Prabhu all belong to the same Viṣṇu category, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is nevertheless accepted as the Supreme, and the other two //prabhus// engage in His transcendental loving service to teach ordinary living entities that every one of us is subordinate to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In another place in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|(Ādi 5.142)]] it is said, //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya:// the only supreme master is Kṛṣṇa, and all others, both //viṣṇu-tattva// and //jīva-tattva,// engage in the service of the Lord. Both the //vi//ṣ//ṇu-tattva// (as Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita) and the //jīva-tattva// (//śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda//) engage in the service of the Lord, but one must distinguish between the //viṣṇu-tattva// servitors and the //jīva-tattva// servitors. The //jīva-tattva// servitor, the spiritual master, is actually the servitor God. As explained in previous verses, in the absolute world there are no such differences, yet one must observe these differences in order to distinguish the Supreme from His subordinates.
