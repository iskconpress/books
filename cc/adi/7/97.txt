In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.1.38) it is stated:

> brahmānando bhaved eṣa
> cet parārdha-guṇī-kṛtaḥ
> naiti bhakti-sukhāmbhodheḥ
> paramāṇu-tulām api

"If //brahmānanda,// the transcendental bliss derived from understanding impersonal Brahman, were multiplied a million times, such a quantity of //brahmānanda// could not compare with even an atomic portion of the pleasure relished in pure devotional service."
