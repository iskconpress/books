**"To prove their philosophy, the members of the Māyāvāda school have given up the real, easily understood meaning of the Vedic literature and introduced indirect meanings based on their imaginative powers."**

===== Purport =====

Unfortunately, the Śaṅkarite interpretation has covered almost the entire world. Therefore there is a great need to present the original, easily understood natural import of the Vedic literature. We have therefore begun by presenting //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// and we propose to present all the Vedic literature in terms of the direct meaning of its words.
