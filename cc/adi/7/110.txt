The Vedic literature is to be considered a source of real knowledge, but if one does not take it as it is, one will be misled. For example, the //Bhagavad-gītā// is an important book of Vedic literature that has been taught for many years, but because it was commented upon by unscrupulous rascals, people derived no benefit from it, and no one came to the conclusion of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Since the purpose of the //Bhagavad-gītā// is now being presented as it is, however, within four or five short years thousands of people all over the world have become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the difference between direct and indirect explanations of the Vedic literature. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //mukhya-vṛttye sei artha parama mahattva:// "To teach the Vedic literature according to its direct meaning, without false commentary, is glorious." Unfortunately, Śrī Śaṅkarācārya, by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, compromised between atheism and theism in order to cheat the atheists and bring them to theism, and to do so he gave up the direct method of Vedic knowledge and tried to present a meaning which is indirect. It is with this purpose that he wrote his //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra.//

One should not, therefore, attribute very much importance to the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// In order to understand Vedānta philosophy, one must study //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which begins with the words //oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya, janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ:// "I offer my obeisances unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, who is the Supreme All-pervading Personality of Godhead. I meditate upon Him, the transcendent reality, who is the primeval cause of all causes, from whom all manifested universes arise, in whom they dwell and by whom they are destroyed. I meditate upon that eternally effulgent Lord who is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations and yet is fully independent." [[books:sb:1:1:1|(Bhāg. 1.1.1)]] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the real commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra.// Unfortunately, if one is attracted to Śrī Śaṅkarācārya's commentary, //Śārīraka-bhāṣya,// his spiritual life is doomed.

One may argue that since Śaṅkarācārya is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, how is it that he cheated people in this way? The answer is that he did so on the order of his master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the //Padma Purāṇa// in the words of Lord Śiva himself:

> māyāvādam asac chāstraṁ
> pracchannaṁ bauddham ucyate
> mayaiva kalpitaṁ devi
> kalau brāhmaṇa-rūpiṇā
>
> brahmaṇaś cāparaṁ rūpaṁ
> nirguṇaṁ vakṣyate mayā
> sarva-svaṁ jagato'py asya
> mohanārthaṁ kalau yuge
>
> vedānte tu mahā-śāstre
> māyāvādam avaidikam
> mayaiva vakṣyate devi
> jagatāṁ nāśa-kāraṇāt

"The Māyāvāda philosophy," Lord Śiva informed his wife Pārvatī, "is impious [//asac chāstra//]. It is covered Buddhism. My dear Pārvatī, in the form of a //brāhmaṇa// in the Kali-yuga I teach this imagined Māyāvāda philosophy. In order to cheat the atheists, I describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be without form and without qualities. Similarly, in explaining Vedānta I describe the same Māyāvāda philosophy in order to mislead the entire population toward atheism by denying the personal form of the Lord." In the //Śiva Purāṇa// the Supreme Personality of Godhead told Lord Śiva:

> dvāparādau yuge bhūtvā
> kalayā mānuṣādiṣu
> svāgamaiḥ kalpitais tvaṁ ca
> janān mad-vimukhān kuru

"In the Kali-yuga, mislead the people in general by propounding imaginary meanings for the //Vedas// to bewilder them." These are the descriptions of the //Purāṇas.//

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that //mukhya-vṛtti// ("the direct meaning") is //abhidhā-vṛtti,// or the meaning that one can understand immediately from the statements of dictionaries, whereas //gauṇa-vṛtti// ("the indirect meaning") is a meaning that one imagines without consulting the dictionary. For example, one politician has said that Kurukṣetra refers to the body, but in the dictionary there is no such definition. Therefore this imaginary meaning is //gauṇa-vṛtti,// whereas the direct meaning found in the dictionary is //mukhya-vṛtti// or //abhidhā-vṛtti.// This is the distinction between the two. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends that one understand the Vedic literature in terms of //abhidhā-vṛtti,// and the //gauṇa-vṛtti// He rejects. Sometimes, however, as a matter of necessity, the Vedic literature is described in terms of the //lakṣaṇā-vṛtti// or //gauṇa-vṛtti,// but one should not accept such explanations as permanent truths.

The purpose of the discussions in the //Upaniṣads// and //Vedānta-sūtra// is to philosophically establish the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. The impersonalists, however, in order to establish their philosophy, accept these discussions in terms of //lakṣaṇā-vṛtti,// or indirect meanings. Thus instead of being //tattva-vāda,// or in search of the Absolute Truth, they become Māyāvāda, or illusioned by the material energy. When Śrī Viṣṇusvāmī, one of the four //ācaryas// of the Vaiṣṇava cult, presented his thesis on the subject matter of //śuddhādvaita-vāda,// immediately the Māyāvādīs took advantage of this philosophy and tried to establish their //advaita-vāda// or //kevalādvaita-vāda.// To defeat this //kevalādvaita-vāda,// Śrī Rāmānujācārya presented his philosophy as //viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda,// and Śrī Madhvācārya presented his philosophy of //tattva-vāda,// both of which are stumbling blocks to the Māyāvādīs because they defeat their philosophy in scrupulous detail. Students of Vedic philosophy know very well how strongly Śrī Rāmānujācārya's //viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda// and Śrī Madhvācārya's //tattva-vāda// contest the impersonal Māyāvāda philosophy. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, accepted the direct meaning of the Vedānta philosophy and thus defeated the Māyāvāda philosophy immediately. He opined in this connection that anyone who follows the principles of the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// is doomed. This is confirmed in the //Padma Purāṇa,// where Lord Śiva tells Pārvatī:

> śṛṇu devi pravakṣyāmi
> tāmasāni yathā-kramam
> yeṣāṁ śravaṇa-mātreṇa
> pātityaṁ jñāninām api
>
> apārthaṁ śruti-vākyānāṁ
> darśayaḹ loka-garhitam
> karma-svarūpa-tyājyatvam
> atra ca pratipādyate
>
> sarva-karma-paribhraṁśān
> naiṣkarmyaṁ tatra cocyate
> parātma-jīvayor aikyaṁ
> mayātra pratipādyate

"My dear wife, hear my explanations of how I have spread ignorance through Māyāvāda philosophy. Simply by hearing it, even an advanced scholar will fall down. In this philosophy, which is certainly very inauspicious for people in general, I have misrepresented the real meaning of the //Vedas// and recommended that one give up all activities in order to achieve freedom from //karma.// In this Māyāvāda philosophy I have described the //jīvātmā// and Paramātmā to be one and the same." How the Māyāvāda philosophy was condemned by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His followers is described in //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Antya-līlā,// Second Chapter, verses 94 through 99, where Svarūpa-dāmodara Gosvāmī says that anyone who is eager to understand the Māyāvāda philosophy must be considered insane. This especially applies to a Vaiṣṇava who reads the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// and considers himself to be one with God. The Māyāvādī philosophers have presented their arguments in such attractive, flowery language that hearing Māyāvāda philosophy may sometimes change the mind of even a //mahā-bhāgavata,// or very advanced devotee. An actual Vaiṣṇava cannot tolerate any philosophy that claims God and the living being to be one and the same.
