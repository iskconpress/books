Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara appealed to the lotus feet of the Lord regarding their grief at the criticism of Him by the //sannyāsīs// in Benares. Caitanya Mahāprabhu merely smiled, yet He wanted to fulfill the desires of His devotees, and the opportunity came when the //brāhmaṇa// came to request Him to accept his invitation to be present in the midst of the other //sannyāsīs.// This coincidence was made possible by the omnipotency of the Lord.
