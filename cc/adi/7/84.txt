While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should not desire the material advancements represented by economic development, religiosity, sense gratification and ultimately liberation from the material world. As stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the highest perfection in life is to develop one's love for Kṛṣṇa (//premā pum-artho mahān śri-caitanya-mahāprabhor matam idam//). When we compare love of Godhead with religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, we can understand that these achievements may be desirable objectives for //bubhukṣus,// or those who desire to enjoy this material world, and //mumukṣus,// or those who desire liberation from it, but they are very insignificant in the eyes of a pure devotee who has developed //bhāva,// the preliminary stage of love of Godhead.

//Dharma// (religiosity), //artha// (economic development), //kāma// (sense gratification) and //mokṣa// (liberation) are the four principles of religion that pertain to the material world. Therefore in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is declared, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra:// cheating religious systems in terms of these four material principles are completely discarded from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// for //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// teaches only how to develop one's dormant love of God. The //Bhagavad-gītā// is the preliminary study of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and therefore it ends with the words, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]] To adopt this means, one should reject all ideas of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation and fully engage in the service of the Lord, which is transcendental to these four principles. Love of Godhead is the original function of the spirit soul, and it is as eternal as the soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This eternity is called //sanātana.// When a devotee revives his loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it should be understood that he has been successful in achieving the desired goal of his life. At that time everything is automatically done by the mercy of the holy name, and the devotee automatically advances in his spiritual progress.
