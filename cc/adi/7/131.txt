It is said:

> vede rāmāyaṇe caiva
> purāṇe bhārate tathā
> ādāv ante ca madhye ca
> hariḥ sarvatra gīyate

In the Vedic literature, including the //Rāmāyaṇa, Purāṇas// and //Mahābhārata,// from the very beginning (//ādau//) to the end (//ante ca//), as well as within the middle (//madhye ca//), only Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is explained.
