This statement by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:11|(1.2.11)]]:

"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān." The Absolute Truth is ultimately understood as Bhagavān, partially understood as Paramātmā and vaguely understood as the impersonal Brahman. Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is opulent in all excellence; no one can be equal to or greater than Him. This is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:7|(Bg. 7.7)]], where the Lord says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya:// "O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me." There are many other verses which prove that the Absolute Truth in the ultimate sense is understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.
