===== Purport =====

By offering His obeisances to the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very clearly exhibited His humbleness to everyone. Vaiṣṇavas must not be disrespectful to anyone, to say nothing of a //sannyāsī.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches, //amāninā māna-dena:// one should always be respectful to others but should not demand respect for himself. A //sannyāsī// should always walk barefoot, and therefore when he enters a temple or a society of devotees he should first wash his feet and then sit down in a proper place. In India it is still the prevalent custom that one put his shoes in a specified place and then enter the temple barefoot after washing his feet. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an ideal //ācārya,// and those who follow in His footsteps should practice the methods of devotional life that He teaches us.
