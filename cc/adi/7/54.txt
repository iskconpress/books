===== Purport =====

This //brāhmaṇa// knew that Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the only Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// in Benares at that time and all the others were Māyāvādīs. It is the duty of a //gṛhastha// to sometimes invite //sannyāsīs// to take food at his home. This //gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa// wanted to invite all the //sannyāsīs// to his house, but he also knew that it would be very difficult to induce Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to accept such an invitation because the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// would be present. Therefore he fell down at His feet and fervently appealed to the Lord to be compassionate and grant his request. Thus he humbly submitted his desire.
