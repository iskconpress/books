===== Purport =====

Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// address each other as Nārāyaṇa. Whenever they see another //sannyāsī,// they offer him respect by calling //oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya// ("I offer my respect unto you, Nārāyaṇa"), although they know perfectly well what kind of Nārāyaṇa he is. Nārāyaṇa has four hands, but although they are puffed up with the idea of being Nārāyaṇa, they cannot exhibit more than two. Since their philosophy declares that Nārāyaṇa and an ordinary human being are both on the same level, they sometimes use the term //daridra-nārāyaṇa// ("poor Nārāyaṇa"), which was invented by a so-called //svāmī// who did not know anything about Vedānta philosophy. Therefore although all these Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// who called themselves Nārāyaṇa were actually unaware of the position of Nārāyaṇa, due to their austerities Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu enabled them to understand Him to be Nārāyaṇa Himself. Lord Caitanya is certainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa appearing as a devotee of Nārāyaṇa, and thus the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// understanding that He was directly Nārāyaṇa Himself whereas they were false, puffed-up Nārāyaṇas, spoke to Him as follows.
