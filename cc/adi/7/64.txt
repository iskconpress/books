Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// are always very puffed up because of their knowledge of Sanskrit and because they belong to the Śaṅkara-sampradāya. They are always under the impression that unless one is a //brāhmaṇa// and a very good Sanskrit scholar, especially in grammar, one cannot accept the renounced order of life or become a preacher. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// always misinterpret all the //śāstras// with their word jugglery and grammatical compositions, yet Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya himself condemned such jugglery of words in the verse //prāpte sannihite kāle na hi na hi rakṣati ḍukṛñ karaṇe. Ḍukṛñ// refers to suffixes and prefixes in Sanskrit grammar. Śaṅkarācārya warned his disciples that if they concerned themselves only with the principles of grammar, not worshiping Govinda, they were fools who would never be saved. Yet in spite of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya's instructions, foolish Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// are always busy juggling words on the basis of strict Sanskrit grammar.

Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// are very puffed up if they hold the elevated //sannyāsa// title Tīrtha, Āśrama or Sarasvatī. Even among Māyāvādīs, those who belong to other //sampradāyas// and hold other titles, such as Vana, Araṇya or Bhāratī, are considered to be lower-grade //sannyāsīs.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa// from the Bhāratī-sampradāya, and thus He considered Himself a lower //sannyāsī// than Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. To remain distinct from Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// the //sannyāsīs// of the Māyāvādi-sampradāya always think themselves to be situated in a very elevated spiritual order, but Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in order to teach them how to become humble and meek, accepted Himself as belonging to a lower //sampradāya// of //sannyāsīs.// Thus He wanted to point out clearly that a //sannyāsī// is one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge. One who is advanced in spiritual knowledge should be accepted as occupying a better position than those who lack such knowledge.

The Māyāvādi-sampradāya //sannyāsīs// are generally known as Vedāntīs, as if Vedānta were their monopoly. Actually, however, Vedāntī refers to a person who perfectly knows Kṛṣṇa. As confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gitā, vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// "By all the //Vedas// it is Kṛṣṇa who is to be known." [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]] The so-called Māyāvādī Vedāntīs do not know who Kṛṣṇa is; therefore their title of Vedāntī, or "knower of Vedānta philosophy," is simply a pretension. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// always think of themselves as real //sannyāsīs// and consider //sannyāsīs// of the Vaiṣṇava order to be //brahmacārīs.// A //brahmacārī// is supposed to engage in the service of a //sannyāsī// and accept him as his //guru.// Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// therefore declare themselves to be not only //gurus// but //jagad-gurus,// or the spiritual masters of the entire world, although, of course, they cannot see the entire world. Sometimes they dress gorgeously and travel on the backs of elephants in processions, and thus they are always puffed up, accepting themselves as //jagad-gurus.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, however, has explained that //jagad-guru// properly refers to one who is the controller of his tongue, mind, words, belly, genitals and anger. //Pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt:// such a //jagad-guru// is completely fit to make disciples all over the world. Due to false prestige, Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// who do not have these qualifications sometimes harass and blaspheme a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// who humbly engages in the service of the Lord.
