Becoming one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not very important for a devotee. //Muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān// (//Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// 107). Speaking from his actual experience, Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura says that if one develops love of Godhead, //mukti// (liberation) becomes subservient and unimportant to him. //Mukti// stands before the devotee and is prepared to render all kinds of services. The Māyāvādī philosophers' standard of //mukti// is very insignificant for a devotee, for by devotional service even the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes subordinate to him. An actual example is that the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa became the chariot driver of Arjuna, and when Arjuna asked Him to draw his chariot between the two armies (//senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta//), Kṛṣṇa executed his order. Such is the relationship between the Supreme Lord and a devotee that although the Lord is greater than the greatest, He is prepared to render service to the insignificant devotee by dint of his sincere and unalloyed devotional service.
