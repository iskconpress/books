Here again it may be emphasized that although jealous rascals protest that Europeans and Americans cannot be given the sacred thread or //sannyāsa,// there is no need even to consider whether one is a gentleman or a rogue because this is a spiritual movement which is not concerned with the external body of skin and bones. Because it is being properly conducted under the guidance of the Pañca-tattva, strictly following the regulative principles, it has nothing to do with external impediments.
