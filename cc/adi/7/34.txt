===== Purport =====

There are four orders of spiritual life, namely, //brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa,// and in each of these //āśramas// there are four divisions. The divisions of the //brahmacary-āśrama// are //sāvitrya, prājāpatya, brāhma// and //bṛhat,// and the divisions of the //gṛhasthāśrama// are //vārtā// (professionals), //sañcaya// (accumulators), //śālīna// (those who do not ask anything from anyone) and //śiloñchana// (those who collect grains from the paddy fields). Similarly, the divisions of the //vānaprasthāśrama// are //vaikhānasa, vālakhilya, auḍumbara// and //pheṇapa,// and the divisions of //sannyāsa// are //kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, haṁsa// and //niṣkriya.// There are two kinds of //sannyāsīs,// who are called //dhīras// and //narottamas,// as stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (1.13.26-27). At the end of the month of January in the year 1432 //śakābda// (A.D. 1511), Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the //sannyāsa// order from Keśava Bhāratī, who belonged to the Śaṅkara-sampradāya.
