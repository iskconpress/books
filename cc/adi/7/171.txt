===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to preach the //saṅkīrtana// movement of love of Kṛṣṇa throughout the entire world, and therefore during His presence He inspired the //saṅkīrtana// movement. Specifically, He sent Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī to Vṛndāvana and Nityānanda to Bengal and personally went to South India. In this way He kindly left the task of preaching His cult in the rest of the world to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The members of this Society must always remember that if they stick to the regulative principles and preach sincerely according to the instructions of the //ācāryas,// surely they will have the profound blessings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and their preaching work will be successful everywhere throughout the world.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-lilā,  Seventh Chapter, describing Lord Caitanya in five features.//
