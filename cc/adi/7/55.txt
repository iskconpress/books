An //ācārya,// or great personality of the Vaiṣṇava school, is very strict in his principles, but although he is as hard as a thunderbolt, sometimes he is as soft as a rose. Thus actually he is independent. He follows all the rules and regulations strictly, but sometimes he slackens this policy. It was known that Lord Caitanya never mixed with the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// yet He conceded to the request of the //brāhmaṇa,// as stated in the next verse.
