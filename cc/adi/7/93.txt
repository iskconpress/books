===== Purport =====

This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.2.40) was spoken by Śrī Nārada Muni to Vasudeva to teach him about //Bhāgavata-dharma.// Vasudeva had already achieved the result of //Bhāgavata-dharma// because Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in his house as his son, yet in order to teach others, he desired to hear from Śrī Nārada Muni to be enlightened in the process of //Bhāgavata-dharma.// This is the humbleness of a great devotee.
