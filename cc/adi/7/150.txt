Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the mercy incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is addressed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī as //mahā-vadānyāvatāra,// or the most magnanimous incarnation. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also says, //karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau:// it is only by His mercy that He has descended in this Age of Kali. Here this is exemplified. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like to see Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// because He thought of them as offenders to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, but here He excuses them (//tāṅ-sabāra kṣami' aparādha//). This is an example in preaching. //Āpani ācari' bhakti śikhāimu sabāre.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches us that those whom preachers meet are almost all offenders who are opposed to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but it is a preacher's duty to convince them of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and then induce them to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Our propagation of the //saṅkīrtana// movement is continuing, despite many opponents, and people are taking up this chanting process even in remote parts of the world like Africa. By inducing the offenders to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu exemplified the success of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We should follow very respectfully in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, and there is no doubt that we shall be successful in our attempts.
