===== Purport =====

The word //rāsādi-vilāsī// ("the enjoyer of the //rāsa// dance") is very important. The //rāsa// dance can be enjoyed only by Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the supreme leader and chief of the damsels of Vṛndāvana. All other devotees are His associates. Although no one can compare with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are many unscrupulous rascals who imitate the //rāsa// dance of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They are Māyāvādīs, and people should be wary of them. The //rāsa// dance can be performed only by Śrī Kṛṣṇa and no one else.
