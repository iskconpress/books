===== Purport =====

The respectful behavior of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī toward Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very much to be appreciated. Such behavior is calculated to be //ajñāta-sukṛti,// or pious activities that one executes unknowingly. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very tactfully gave Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī an opportunity to advance in //ajñāta-sukṛti// so that in the future he might actually become a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī.//
