Here it is said that Lord Caitanya made the entire universe thankful to Him for propagating the //saṅkīrtana// movement with His associates. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has already sanctified the entire universe by His presence five hundred years ago, and therefore anyone who attempts to serve Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sincerely by following in His footsteps and following the instructions of the //ācāryas// will successfully be able to preach the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// all over the universe. There are some foolish critics who say that Europeans and Americans cannot be offered //sannyāsa,// but here we find that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to preach the //saṅkīrtana// movement all over the universe. For preaching work, //sannyāsīs// are essential. These critics think that only Indians or Hindus should be offered //sannyāsa// to preach, but their knowledge is practically nil. Without //sannyāsīs,// the preaching work will be impeded. Therefore, under the instruction of Lord Caitanya and with the blessings of His associates, there should be no discrimination in this matter, but people in all parts of the world should be trained to preach and given //sannyāsa// so that the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //saṅkīrtana// movement will expand boundlessly. We do not care about the criticism of fools. We shall go on with our work and simply depend on the blessings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates, the Pañca-tattva.
