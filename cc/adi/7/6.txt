Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu is the immediate expansion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as His brother. He is the personified spiritual bliss of //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.// His body is transcendental and full of ecstasy in devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is therefore called //bhakta-rūpa// (the form of a devotee), and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu is called //bhakta-svarūpa// (the expansion of a devotee). Śrī Advaita Prabhu, the incarnation of a devotee, is //viṣṇu-tattva// and belongs to the same category. There are also different types of //bhaktas,// or devotees, on the platforms of neutrality, servitude, friendship, parenthood and conjugal love. Devotees like Śrī Dāmodara, Śrī Gadādhara and Śrī Rāmānanda are different energies. This confirms the Vedic //sūtra parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.// All these //bhakta// subjects taken together constitute Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself.
