Lord Caitanya taught Sanātana Gosvāmī in the line of disciplic succession. Sanātana Gosvāmī was a very learned scholar in Sanskrit and other languages, but until instructed by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu he did not write anything about Vaiṣṇava behavior. His very famous book //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// which gives directions for Vaiṣṇava candidates, was written completely in compliance with the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In this //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī gives definite instructions that by proper initiation by a bona fide spiritual master one can immediately become a //brāhmaṇa.// In this connection he says:

> yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ
> tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām

"As bell metal is turned to gold when mixed with mercury in an alchemical process, so one who is properly trained and initiated by a bona fide spiritual master immediately becomes a //brāhmaṇa.//" Sometimes those born in //brāhmaṇa// families protest this, but they have no strong arguments against this principle. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa and His devotee, one's life can change. This is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// by the words //jahāti bandham// and //śudhyanti. Jahāti bandham// indicates that a living entity is conditioned by a particular type of body. The body is certainly an impediment, but one who associates with a pure devotee and follows his instructions can avoid this impediment and become a regular //brāḥmaṇa// by initiation under his strict guidance. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states how a non-//brāhmaṇa// can be turned into a //brāhmaṇa// by the association of a pure devotee. //Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ:// Lord Viṣṇu is so powerful that He can do anything He likes. Therefore it is not difficult for Viṣṇu to change the body of a devotee who is under the guidance of a pure devotee of the Lord.
