Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this connection, "Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// accept that the commentary by Śrī Śaṅkarācārya known as //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// gives the real meaning of the //Vedanta-sūtra.// In other words, Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// accept the meanings expressed in the explanations of the //Vedānta-sūtra// by Śaṅkarācārya, which are based on monism. Thus they explain the //Vedānta-sūtra,// the //Upaniṣads// and all such Vedic literature in their own impersonal way." The great Māyāvādī //sannyāsī// Sadānanda Yogīndra has written a book known as //Vedānta-sāra,// in which he writes, //vedānto nāma upaniṣat-pramāṇam. tad-upakārīṇi śārīraka-sūtrādīni ca.// According to Sadānanda Yogīndra, the //Vedānta-sūtra// and //Upaniṣads,// as presented by Śrī Śaṅkarācārya in his //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// commentary, are the only sources of Vedic evidence. Actually, however, //Vedānta// refers to the essence of Vedic knowledge, and it is not a fact that there is nothing more than Śaṅkarācārya's //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// There are other //Vedānta// commentaries, written by Vaiṣṇava //ācāryas,// none of whom follow Śrī Śaṅkarācārya or accept the imaginative commentary of his school. Their commentaries are based on the philosophy of duality. Monist philosophers like Śaṅkarācārya and his followers want to establish that God and the living entity are one, and instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead they present themselves as God. They want to be worshiped as God by others. Such persons do not accept the philosophies of the Vaiṣṇava //ācāryas,// which are known as //śuddhādvaita// (purified monism), //śuddha-dvaita// (purified dualism), //viśiṣṭādvaita// (specific monism), //dvaitādvaita// (monism and dualism) and //acintya-bhedābheda// (inconceivable oneness and difference). Māyāvādīs do not discuss these philosophies, for they are firmly convinced of their own philosophy of //kevalādvaita,// exclusive monism. Accepting this system of philosophy as the pure understanding of the //Vedānta-sūtra,// they believe that Kṛṣṇa has a body made of material elements and that the activities of loving service to Kṛṣṇa are sentimentality. They are known as Māyāvādīs because according to their opinion Kṛṣṇa has a body made of //māyā,// and the loving service of the Lord executed by devotees is also //māyā.// They consider such devotional service to be an aspect of fruitive activities (//karma-kāṇḍa//). According to their view, //bhakti// consists of mental speculation or sometimes meditation. This is the difference between the Māyāvādī and Vaiṣṇava philosophies.
