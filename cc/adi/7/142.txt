===== Purport =====

By the practice of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting, the impure heart of a conditioned soul is purified, and thus he can understand his eternal relationship with the Supreme personality of Godhead. That eternal relationship is described by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //jīvera 'svarūpa' haya kṛṣṇera 'nitya-dāsa'.// "The living entity is an eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." When one is convinced about this relationship, which is called //sambandha,// he then acts accordingly. That is called //abhidheya.// The next step is //prayojana-siddhi,// or fulfillment of the ultimate goal of one's life. If one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and act accordingly, automatically his mission in life is fulfilled. The Māyāvādī philosophers miss even the first stage in self-realization because they have no conception of God's being personal. He is the master of all, and He is the only person who can accept the service of all living entities, but since this knowledge is lacking in Māyāvāda philosophy, Māyāvādīs do not have knowledge even of their relationship with God. They wrongly think that everyone is God or that everyone is equal to God. Therefore, since the real position of the living entity is not clear to them, how can they advance further? Although they are very puffed-up at being liberated, Māyāvādī philosophers very shortly fall down again to material activities due to their neglecting the lotus feet of the Lord. That is called //patanty adhaḥ.//

> patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ

(//Bhāg.// 10.2.32)

>It is the statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja that persons who think themselves liberated but do not execute devotional service, not knowing their relationship with the Lord, are certainly misled. One must know his relationship with the Lord and act accordingly. Then the fulfillment of his life's mission will be possible.
