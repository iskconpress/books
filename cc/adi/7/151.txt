Previously Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu neither mixed nor talked with the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// but now He is taking lunch with them. It is to be concluded that when Lord Caitanya induced them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and excused them for their offenses, they were purified, and therefore there was no objection to taking lunch, or //bhagavat-prasāda,// with them, although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu knew that the food was not offered to the Deity. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// do not worship the Deity, or if they do so they generally worship the deity of Lord Śiva or the //pañcopāsanā// (Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Śiva, Durgādevī, Gaṇeśa and Sūrya). Here we do not find any mention of the demigods or Viṣṇu, and yet Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted food in the midst of the //sannyāsīs// on the basis that they had chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and that He had excused their offenses.
