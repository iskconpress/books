The complete path of //bhakti-yoga// is based upon the process of becoming humble and submissive. By the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// were very humble and submissive after hearing His explanation of the //Vedānta-sūtra,// and they begged to be pardoned for the offenses they had committed by criticizing the Lord for simply chanting and dancing and not taking part in the study of the //Vedānta-sūtra.// We are propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement simply by following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We may not be very well versed in the //Vedānta-sūtra// aphorisms and may not understand their meaning, but we follow in the footsteps of the //ācāryas,// and because of our strictly and obediently following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it is to be understood that we know everything regarding the //Vedānta-sūtra.//
