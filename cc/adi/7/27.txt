In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his //Anubhāṣya// that since the living entities all belong to the marginal potency of the Lord, each and every living entity has a natural tendency to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, although at the same time the seed of material enjoyment is undoubtedly within him. The seed of material enjoyment, watered by the course of material nature, fructifies to become a tree of material entanglement that endows the living entity with all kinds of material enjoyment. To enjoy such material facilities is to be afflicted with the three material miseries. However, when by nature's law there is a flood, the seeds within the earth become inactive. Similarly, as the inundation of love of Godhead spreads all over the world, the seeds of material enjoyment become impotent. Thus the more the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads, the more the desire for material enjoyment decreases. The seed of material enjoyment automatically becomes impotent with the increase of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Instead of being envious that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is spreading all over the world by the grace of Lord Caitanya, those who are jealous should be happy, as indicated here by the words //parama ullāsa.// But because they are //kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs// or //prākṛta-bhaktas// (materialistic devotees who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge), they are envious instead of happy, and they try to find faults in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Yet Śrīmat Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī writes in his //Caitanya-candrāmṛta// that when influenced by Lord Caitanya's Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, materialists become averse to talking about their wives and children, supposedly learned scholars give up their tedious studies of Vedic literature, //yogīs// give up their impractical practices of mystic //yoga,// ascetics give up their austere activities of penance and austerity, and //sannyāsīs// give up their study of Sāṅkhya philosophy. Thus they are all attracted by the //bhakti-yoga// practices of Lord Caitanya and cannot relish a mellow taste superior to that of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
