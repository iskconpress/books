===== Purport =====

As explained in regard to verse 41, Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// do not approve of chanting and dancing. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, misunderstood Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be a misled young //sannyāsī,// and therefore he asked Him why He indulged in the association of fanatics instead of executing the duty of a //sannyāsī.//
