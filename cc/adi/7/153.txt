===== Purport =====

Here is an example of how a //sannyāsī// should preach. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Vārāṇasī, He went there alone, not with a big party. Locally, however, He made friendships with Candraśekhara and Tapana Miśra, and Sanātana Gosvāmī also came to see Him. Therefore, although He did not have many friends there, due to His sound preaching and His victory in arguing with the local //sannyāsīs// on the Vedānta philosophy, He became greatly famous in that part of the country, as explained in the next verse.
