As already explained, there are three //prasthānas// on the path of advancement in spiritual knowledge-namely, //nyāya-prasthāna// (Vedānta philosophy), //śruti-prasthāna// (the //Upaniṣads// and Vedic //mantras//) and //smṛti-prasthāna// (the //Bhagavad-gītā, Mahābhārata, Purāṇas,// etc.). Unfortunately, Māyāvādī philosophers do not accept the //smṛti-prasthāna. Smṛti// refers to the conclusions drawn from the Vedic evidence. Sometimes Māyāvādī philosophers do not accept the authority of the //Bhagavad-gītā// and the //Purāṇas,// and this is called //ardha-kukkuṭī-nyāya,// "the logic of half a hen." (A foolish farmer once thought he would save money by cutting off his hen's head, which he had to feed, and leaving its tail, which produced the eggs.) If one believes in the Vedic literature, one must accept all the Vedic scriptures recognized by the great //ācāryas,// but these Māyāvādī philosophers accept only the //nyāya-prasthāna// and //śruti-prasthāna,// rejecting the //smṛti-prasthāna.// Here, however, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu cites evidence from the //Gītā, Viṣṇu Purāṇa,// etc., which are //smṛti-prasthāna.// No one can avoid the Personality of Godhead in the statements of the //Bhagavad-gītā// and other Vedic scripttures such as the //Mahābhārata// and the //Purāṇas.// Lord Caitanya therefore quotes a passage from the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:5|(Bg. 7.5)]].
