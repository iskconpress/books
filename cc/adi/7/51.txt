This is a manifestation of real love for Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There are three categories of Vaiṣṇavas: //kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs, madhyama-adhikārīs// and //uttama-adhikārīs.// The //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// or the devotee in the lowest stage of Vaiṣṇava life, has firm faith but is not familiar with the conclusions of the //śāstras.// The devotee in the second stage, the //madhyama-adhikārī,// is completely aware of the śāstric conclusion and has firm faith in his //guru// and the Lord. He, therefore, avoiding nondevotees, preaches to the innocent. However, the //mahā-bhāgavata// or //uttama-adhikārī,// the devotee in the highest stage of devotional life, does not see anyone as being against the Vaiṣṇava principles, for he regards everyone as a Vaiṣṇava but himself. This is the essence of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction that one be more tolerant than a tree and think oneself lower than the straw in the street (//tṛṇād api su-nīcena taror iva sahiṣṇunā//). However, even if a devotee is in the //uttama-bhāgavata// status he must come down to the second status of life, //madhyama-adhikārī,// to be a preacher, for a preacher should not tolerate blasphemy against another Vaiṣṇava. Although a //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī// also cannot tolerate such blasphemy, he is not competent to stop it by citing śāstric evidences. Therefore Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara are understood to be //kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs// because they could not refute the arguments of the //sannyāsīs// in Benares. They appealed to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to take action, for they felt that they could not tolerate such criticism although they also could not stop it.
