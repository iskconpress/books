===== Purport =====

When Lord Nityānanda Prabhu rebuked Śivānanda Sena on the way to Purī, these two nephews of Śivānanda left the company as a protest and went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. The Lord could understand the feelings of the boys, and He asked His personal assistant Govinda to supply them //prasāda// until the party of Śivānanda arrived. During the Ratha-yātrā //saṅkīrtana// festival these two brothers were members of the party led by Mukunda. In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 174, it is said that the //gopī// whose name was Kātyāyanī appeared as Śrīkānta Sena.
