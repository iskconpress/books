===== Purport =====

In the //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Twenty-one, it is stated that Devānanda Paṇḍita and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's father, Viśārada, lived in the same village. Devānanda Paṇḍita was a professional reciter of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// but Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like his interpretation of it. In the present town of Navadvīpa, which was formerly known as Kuliyā, Lord Caitanya showed such mercy to him that he gave up the Māyāvādī interpretation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and learned how to explain //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in terms of //bhakti.// Formerly, when Devānanda was expounding the Māyāvādī interpretation, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura was once present in his meeting, and when he began to cry, Devānanda's students drove him away. Some days later, Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed that way, and when He met Devānanda He chastised him severely because of his Māyāvāda interpretation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// At that time Devānanda had little faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but one night some time later Vakreśvara Paṇḍita was a guest in his house, and when he explained the science of Kṛṣṇa, Devānanda was convinced about the identity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus he was induced to explain //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// according to the Vaiṣṇava understanding In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 106, it is described that he was formerly Bhāguri Muni, who was the //sabhā-paṇḍita// who recited Vedic literature in the house of Nanda Mahārāja.
