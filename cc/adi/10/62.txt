===== Purport =====

Caitanya dāsa, the eldest son of Śivānanda Sena, wrote a commentary on //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// that was later translated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his paper //Sajjana-toṣaṇī.// According to expert opinion, Caitanya dāsa was the author of the book //Caitanya-carita// (also known as //Caitanya-caritāmṛta//), which was written in Sanskrit. The author was not Kavi-karṇapūra, as generally supposed. This is the opinion of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Śrī Rāmadāsa was the second son of Śivānanda Sena. It is stated in the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// (145) that the two famous parrots named Dakṣa and Vicakṣaṇa in //kṛṣṇa-līlā// became the elder brothers of Kavi-karṇapūra, namely, Caitanya dāsa and Rāmadāsa. Karṇapūra, the third son, who was also known as Paramānanda dāsa or Purī dāsa, was initiated by Śrīnātha Paṇḍita, who was a disciple of Śrī Advaita Prabhu. Karṇapūra wrote many books that are important in Vaiṣṇava literature, such as //Ānanda-vṛndāvana-campū, Alaṅkāra-kaustubha, Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// and the great epic //Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka.// He was born in the year 1448 //śakābda// (A.D. 1527). He continually wrote books for ten years, from 1488 until 1498.
