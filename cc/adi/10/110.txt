Śubhānanda, who formerly lived in Vṛndāvana as Mālatī, was one of the //kīrtana// performers who danced in front of the Ratha-yātrā car during the Jagannātha festival. It is said that he ate the foam that came out of the mouth of the Lord while He danced before the Ratha-yātrā car. Īśāna was a personal servant of Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, who showered her great mercy upon him. He was also very dear to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
