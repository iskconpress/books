These two students were inhabitants of Navadvīpa and were the Lord's first companions in the //saṅkīrtana// movement. According to the //Caitanya-bhāgavata,// Puruṣottama Sañjaya was the son of Mukunda Sañjaya, but the author of //Śrī Caitanya-caritamṛta// has clarified that Puruṣottama and Sañjaya were two people, not one.
