Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya, or Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, one of the six Gosvāmīs, was the son of Tapana Miśra. Born in approximately 1425 //śakābda// (A.D. 1504), he was expert in reciting //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and in the //Antya-līlā,// Chapter Thirteen, it is stated that he was also expert in cooking; whatever he cooked would be nectarean. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was greatly pleased to accept the food that he cooked, and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa used to take the remnants of food left by Śri Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya lived for eight months in Jagannātha Purī, after which Lord Caitanya ordered him to go to Vṛndāvana to join Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya not to marry but to remain a //brahmacārī,// and He also ordered him to read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// constantly. Thus he went to Vṛndāvana, where he engaged in reciting //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. He was so expert in reciting //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that he would recite each and every verse in three melodious tunes. While Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was living with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord blessed him by offering him betel nuts offered to the Jagannātha Deity and a garland of //tulasī// said to be as long as fourteen cubits. Under Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī's order, one of his disciples constructed the Govinda temple. Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī supplied all the ornaments of the Govinda Deity. He never talked of nonsense or worldly matters but always engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day. He never cared to hear blasphemy of a Vaiṣṇava. Even when there were points to be criticized, he used to say that since all the Vaiṣṇavas were engaged in the service of the Lord, he did not mind their faults. Later Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī lived by Rādhā-kuṇḍa in a small cottage. In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 185, it is said that Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was formerly the //gopī// named Rāga-mañjarī.
