There is some question about whether Dvija Haridāsa was the author of //Aṣṭottara-śata-nāma.// He had two sons named Śrīdāma and Gokulānanda, who were disciples of Śrī Advaita Ācārya. Their village, Kāñcana-gaḍiyā, is situated within five miles of the Bājārasāu station, the fifth station from Ājīmagañja in the district of Murśidābād, West Bengal.
