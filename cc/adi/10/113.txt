In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// (203) it is said, "Bhāgavatācārya compiled a book entitled //Kṛṣṇa-prema-taraṅgiṇī,// and he was the most beloved devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu." When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited Varāhanagara, a suburb of Calcutta, He stayed in the house of a most fortunate //brāhmaṇa// who was a very learned scholar in //Bhāgavata// literature. As soon as this //brāhmaṇa// saw Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he began to read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// When Mahāprabhu heard his explanation, which expounded //bhakti-yoga,// He immediately became unconscious in ecstasy. Lord Caitanya later said, "I have never heard such a nice explanation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// I therefore designate you Bhāgavatācārya. Your only duty is to recite //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That is My injunction." His real name was Raghunātha. His monastery, which is situated in Varāhanagara, about three and a half miles north of Calcutta on the bank of the Ganges, still exists, and it is managed by the initiated disciples of the late Śrī Rāmadāsa Bābājī. Presently, however, it is not as well managed as in the presence of Bābājī Mahārāja.

Another name of Ṭhākura Śāraṅga dāsa was Śārṅga Ṭhākura. Sometimes he was also called Śārṅgapāṇi or Śārṅgadhara. He was a resident of Navadvīpa in the neighborhood known as Modadruma-dvīpa, and he used to worship the Supreme Lord in a secluded place on the bank of the Ganges. He did not accept disciples, but he was repeatedly inspired from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do so. Thus one morning he decided, "Whomever I see I shall make my disciple." When he went to the bank of the Ganges to take his bath, by chance he saw a dead body floating in the water, and he touched it with his feet. This immediately brought the body to life, and Ṭhākura Sāraṅga dāsa accepted him as his disciple. This disciple later became famous as Ṭhākura Murāri, and his name is always associated with that of Śrī Sāraṅga. His disciplic succession still inhabits the village of Śar. There is a temple at Māmagācchi that is said to have been started by Śārṅga Ṭhākura. Not long ago, a new temple building was erected in front of a //bakula// tree there, and it is now being managed by the members of the Gauḍīya Maṭha. It is said that the management of the temple is now far better than before. In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// (172) it is stated that Śāraṅga Ṭhākura was formerly a //gopī// named Nāndīmukhī. Some devotees say that he was formerly Prahlāda Mahārāja, but Śrī Kavi-karṇapūra says that his father, Śivānanda Sena, does not accept this proposition.
