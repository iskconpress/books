The three brothers Govinda, Mādhava and Vāsudeva Ghoṣa all belonged to a //kāyastha// family. Govinda established the Gopīnātha temple in Agradvīpa, where he resided. Mādhava Ghoṣa was expert in performing //kīrtana.// No one within this world could compete with him. He was known as the singer of Vṛndāvana and was very dear to Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. It is said that when the three brothers performed //saṅkīrtana,// immediately Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda would dance in ecstasy. According to the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// (188), the three brothers were formerly Kalāvatī, Rasollāsā and Guṇatuṅgā, who recited the songs composed by Śrī Viśākhā-gopī. The three brothers were among one of the seven parties that performed //kīrtana// when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu attended the Ratha-yātrā festival at Jagannātha Purī. Vakreśvara Paṇḍita was the chief dancer in their party. This is vividly described in the //Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Thirteen, verses 42 and 43.
