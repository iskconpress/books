Kara was the surname of Makaradhvaja. At present this surname is generally found in the Kāyastha community. The //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 166, states:

> dhaniṣṭhā bhakṣya-sāmagrīṁ
> kṛṣṇāyādād vraje 'mitām
> saiva sāmprataṁ gaurāṅga-
> priyo rāghava-paṇḍitaḥ

Rāghava Paṇḍita was formerly a confidential //gopī// in Vraja during the time of Lord Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, and his former name was Dhaniṣṭhā. This //gopī,// Dhaniṣṭhā, always engaged in preparing foods for Kṛṣṇa.
