In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 90, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita (Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura) is described as an incarnation of Nārada Muni, and Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita, his younger brother, is said to be an incarnation of Parvata Muni, a great friend of Nārada's. Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita's wife, Mālinī, is celebrated as an incarnation of the nurse Ambikā, who fed Lord Kṛṣṇa with her breast milk, and as already noted, his niece Nārāyaṇī, the mother of Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana dāsa, the author of //ŚrīCaitanya-bhāgavata,// was the sister of Ambikā in //kṛṣṇa-līlā.// We also understand from the description of //Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata// that after Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of the //sannyāsa// order, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita left Navadvīpa, possibly because of feelings of separation, and domiciled at Kumārahaṭṭa.
