Govinda was the personal servant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 137, it is stated that the servants formerly named Bhṛṅgāra and Bhaṅgura in Vṛndāvana became Kāśīśvara and Govinda in Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes. Govinda always engaged in the service of the Lord, even at great risk.
