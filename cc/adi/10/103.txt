Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī accepted Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī as his special guide. Therefore at the end of every chapter he says, //śrī-rūpa-raghunātha-pade yāra āśa caitanya-caritāmṛta kahe kṛṣṇadāsa.// Sometimes it is misunderstood that by using the word //raghunātha// he wanted to offer his respectful obeisances to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, for it is sometimes stated that Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was his initiating spiritual master. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī does not approve of this statement; he does not accept Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī as the spiritual master of Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī.
