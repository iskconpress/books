It should be noted that a //gṛhastha// (householder) must not make his livelihood by begging from anyone. Every householder of the higher castes should engage himself in his own occupational duty as a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya,// but he should not engage in the service of others, for this is the duty of a //śūdra.// One should simply accept whatever he earns by his own profession. The engagements of a //brāhmaṇa// are //yajana, yājana, paṭhana, pāṭhana, dāna// and //pratigraha.// A //brāhmaṇa// should be a worshiper of Viṣṇu, and he should also instruct others how to worship Him. A //kṣatriya// can become a landholder and earn his livelihood by levying taxes or collecting rent from tenants. A //vaiśya// can accept agriculture or general trade as an occupational duty. Since Murāri Gupta was born in a physician's family (//vaidya-vaṁśa//), he practiced as a physician, and with whatever income he earned he maintained his family. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// everyone should try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the execution of his occupational duty. That is the perfection of life. This system is called //daivī-varṇāśrama.// Murāri Gupta was an ideal //gṛhastha,// for he was a great devotee of Lord Rāmacandra and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By practicing as a physician he maintained his family and at the same time satisfied Lord Caitanya to the best of his ability. This is the ideal of householder life.
