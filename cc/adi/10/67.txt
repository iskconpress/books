===== Purport =====

Śrīdhara was a poor //brāhmaṇa// who made a living by selling banana-tree bark to be made into cups. Most probably he had a banana-tree garden and collected the leaves, skin and pulp of the banana trees to sell daily in the market. He spent fifty percent of his income to worship the Ganges, and the balance he used for his subsistence. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started His civil disobedience movement in defiance of the Kāzī, Śrīdhara danced in jubilation.The Lord used to drink water from his water jug. Śrīdhara presented a squash to Śacīdevī to cook before Lord Caitanya took //sannyāsa.// Every year he went to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. According to Kavi-karṇapūra, Śrīdhara was a cowherd boy of Vṛndāvana whose name was Kusumāsava. In his //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 133, it is stated:

> kholā-vecātayā khyātaḥ
> paṇḍitaḥ śrīdharo dvijaḥ
> āsīd vraje hāsya-karo
> yo nāmnā kusumāsavaḥ

"The cowherd boy known as Kusumāsava in //kṛṣṇa-līlā// later became Kholāvecā Śrīdhara during Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //līlā// at Navadvīpa."
