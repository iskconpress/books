It is said that Śaṅkarāraṇya was the //sannyāsa// name of Śrīla Viśvarūpa, who was the elder brother of Viśvambhara (the original name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu). Śaṅkarāraṇya expired in 1432 //śakābda// (A.D. 1512) at Sholapur, where there is a place of pilgrimage known as Pāṇḍerapura. This is referred to in the //Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Nine, verses 299 and 300.

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu opened a primary school in the house of Mukunda, or Mukunda Sañjaya, and Mukunda's son, whose name was Puruṣottama, became the Lord's student. Kāśīnātha arranged the marriage of Lord Caitanya in His previous //āśrama,// when His name was Viśvambhara. Kāśīnātha induced the court //paṇḍita,// Sanātana, to offer Viśvambhara his daughter. In the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verse 50, it is mentioned that Kāśīnātha was an incarnation of the //brāhmaṇa// Kulaka, whom Satrājit sent to arrange the marriage of Kṛṣṇa and Satyabhāmā, and it is mentioned in verse 135 that Rudra, or Śrī Rudrarāma Paṇḍita, was formerly a friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa's named Varūthapa. Śrī Rudrarāma Paṇḍita constructed a big temple at Vallabhapura, which is one mile north of Māheśa, for the Deities named Rādhāvallabha. The descendants of his brother, Yadunandana Vandyopādhyāya, are known as Cakravartī Ṭhākuras, and they are in charge of the maintenance of this temple as //sevaits.// Formerly the Jagannātha Deity used to come to the temple of Rādhāvallabha from Māheśa during the Ratha-yātrā festival, but in the Bengali year 1262 (A.D. 1855), due to a misunderstanding between the priests of the two temples, the Jagannātha Deity stopped coming.
