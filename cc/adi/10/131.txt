In Jagannātha Purī Lord Caitanya lived at the house of Kāśī Miśra, who was the priest of the king. Later this house was inherited by Vakreśvara Paṇḍita and then by his disciple Gopālaguru Gosvāmī, who established there a Deity of Rādhākānta. The //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā// (193) states that Kāśī Miśra was formerly Kubjā in Mathurā.. Pradyumna Miśra, an inhabitant of Orissa, was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Pradyumna Miśra was born of a //brāhmaṇa// family and Rāmānanda Rāya of a non-//brāhmaṇa// family, yet Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised Pradyumna Miśra to take instruction from Rāmānanda Rāya. This incident is described in the //Antya-līlā,// Chapter Five.

Bhavānanda Rāya was the father of Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. His residence was in Ālālanātha (Brahmagiri), which is about twelve miles west of Jagannātha Purī. By caste he belonged to the //karaṇa// community of Orissa, whose members were sometimes known as //kāyasthas// and sometimes as //śūdras,// but he was the governor of Madras under the control of King Pratāparudra of Jagannātha Purī.
