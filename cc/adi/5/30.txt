===== Purport =====

There are two kinds of liberated souls---those who are liberated by the favor of the Lord and those who are liberated by their own effort. One who gets liberation by his own effort is called an impersonalist, and he merges in the glaring effulgence of the Lord, the //brahmajyoti.// But devotees of the Lord who qualify themselves for liberation by devotional service are offered four kinds of liberation, namely //sālokya// (status equal to that of the Lord), //sāmīpya// (constant association with the Lord), //sārṣṭi// (opulence equal to that of the Lord) and //sārūpya// (features like those of the Lord).
