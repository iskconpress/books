Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī Prabhu, the teacher of the science of devotional service, wrote several books, of which the //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta// is very famous; anyone who wants to know about the subject matter of devotees, devotional service and Kṛṣṇa must read this book. Sanātana Gosvāmī also wrote a special commentary on the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// known as the //Daśama-ṭippanī// which is so excellent that by reading it one can understand very deeply the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in His exchanges of loving activities. Another famous book by Sanātana Gosvāmī is the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// which states the rules and regulations for all divisions of Vaiṣṇavas, namely, Vaiṣṇava householders, Vaiṣṇava //brahmacārīs,// Vaiṣṇava //vānaprasthas// and Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs.// This book was especially written, however, for Vaiṣṇava householders. Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī has described Sanātana Gosvāmī in his prayer //Vilāpa-kusumāñjali,// verse six, where he has expressed his obligation to Sanātana Gosvāmī in the following words:

> vairāgya-yug-bhakti-rasaṁ prayatnair
> apāyayan mām anabhīpsum andham
> kṛpāmbudhir yaḥ para-duḥkha-duḥkhī
> sanātanas taṁ prabhum āśrayāmi

"I was unwilling to drink the nectar of devotional service possessed of renunciation, but Sanātana Gosvāmī, out of his causeless mercy, made me drink it, even though I was otherwise unable to do so. Therefore he is an ocean of mercy. He is very compassionate to fallen souls like me, and thus it is my duty to offer my respectful obeisances unto his lotus feet." Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī also, in the last section of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// specifically mentions the names of Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and offers his respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of these three spiritual masters, as well as Raghunātha dāsa. Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī also accepted Sanātana Gosvāmī as the teacher of the science of devotional service. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī is described as the //bhakti-rasācārya,// or one who knows the essence of devotional service. His famous book //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// is the science of devotional service, and by reading this book one can understand the meaning of devotional service. Another of his famous books is //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi.// In this book he elaborately explains the loving affairs and transcendental activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī.
