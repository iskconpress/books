//Māyā,// the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is divided into two parts. //Māyā// is the cause and the ingredient of the cosmic manifestation. As the cause of the cosmic manifestation she is known as //māyā,// and as the agent supplying the ingredients of the cosmic manifestation she is known as //pradhāna.// An explicit description of these divisions of external energy is given in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.24.1-4). Elsewhere in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.63.26) the ingredients and cause of the material cosmic manifestation are described as follows:

> kālo daivaṁ karma jīvaḥ svabhāvo
> dravyaṁ kṣetraṁ prāṇa ātmā vikāraḥ
> tat-saṅghāto bīja-roha-pravāhas
> tvan-māyaiṣā tan-niṣedhaṁ prapadye

"O my Lord! Time, activity, providence and nature are four parts of the causal aspect [//māyā//] of the external energy. The conditioned vital force, the subtle material ingredients called the //dravya,// and material nature (which is the field of activity where the false ego acts as the soul), as well as the eleven senses and five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), which are the sixteen ingredients of the body---these are the ingredient aspect of //māyā.// The body is generated from activity, and activity is generated from the body, just as a tree is generated from a seed that is generated from a tree. This reciprocal cause and effect is called //māyā.// My dear Lord, You can save me from this cycle of cause and effect. I worship Your lotus feet."

Although the living entity is primarily related to the causal portion of //māyā,// he is nevertheless conducted by the ingredients of //māyā.// Three forces work in the causal portion of //māyā:// knowledge, desire and activity. The material ingredients are a manifestation of //māyā// as //pradhāna.// In other words, when the three qualities of //māyā// are in a dormant stage, they exist as //prakṛti, avyakta// or //pradhāna.// The word //avyakta,// referring to the nonmanifest, is another name of //pradhāna.// In the //avyakta// stage, material nature is without varieties. Varieties are manifested by the //pradhāna// portion of //māyā.// The word //pradhāna// is therefore more important than //avyakta// or //prakṛti.//
