===== Purport =====

With reference to the //Viṣṇu-dharmottara,// the //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// explains that Rāma is an incarnation of Vāsudeva, Lakṣmaṇa is an incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Bharata is an incarnation of Pradyumna, and Śatrughna is an incarnation of Aniruddha. The //Padma Purāṇa// describes that Rāmacandra is Nārāyaṇa and that Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna are respectively Śeṣa, Cakra and Śaṅkha (the conchshell in the hand of Nārāyaṇa). In the //Rāma-gīta// of the //Skanda Purāṇa,// Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna have been described as the triple attendants of Lord Rāma.
