//Tamas// means darkness. The material world is dark, and beyond the material world is light. In other words, after passing through the entire material atmosphere, one can come to the luminous spiritual sky, whose impersonal effulgence is known as Siddhaloka. Māyāvādī philosophers who aspire to merge with the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as well as demoniac persons who are killed by Kṛṣṇa, such as Kaṁsa and Śiśupāla, enter that Brahman effulgence. //Yogīs// who attain oneness through meditation according to the Patañjali //yoga// system also reach Siddhaloka. This is a verse from the //Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa.//
