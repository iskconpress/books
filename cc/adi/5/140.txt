The playful pastimes of the Lord caused suspicion in the mind of Lord Brahmā, and therefore Lord Brahmā, to test Kṛṣṇa's Lordship, stole all the Lord's cows and cowherd boys with his own mystic power. Śrī Kṛṣṇa responded, however, by replacing all the cows and boys in the field. Lord Balarāma's thoughts of astonishment at such wonderful retaliation are recorded in this verse [[books:sb:10:13:37|(Bhāg. 10.13.37)]].
