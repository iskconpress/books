===== Purport =====

In his own planet, Lord Brahmā, with the inhabitants of that planet, worships the form of Lord Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, by the //mantra// of eighteen syllables, //klīṁ kṛṣṇāya govindāya gopī-jana-vallabhāya svāhā.// Those who are initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and who chant the Gāyatrī //mantra// three times a day know this //aṣṭādaśākṣara// (eighteen-syllable) //mantra.// The inhabitants of Brahmaloka and the planets below Brahmaloka worship Lord Govinda by meditating with this //mantra.// There is no difference between meditating and chanting, but in the present age meditation is not possible on this planet. Therefore loud chanting of a //mantra// like the //mahā-mantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, with soft chanting of the //aṣṭādaśākṣara,// the //mantra// of eighteen syllables, is recommended.

Lord Brahmā lives in the highest planetary system, known as Brahmaloka or Satyaloka. In every planet there is a predominating deity. As the predominating deity in Satyaloka is Lord Brahmā, so in the heavenly planets Indra is the predominating deity, and on the sun, the sun-god, Vivasvān, is the predominating deity. The inhabitants and predominating deities of every planet are all recommended to worship Govinda either by meditation or by chanting.
