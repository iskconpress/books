===== Purport =====

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in his //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta,// has quoted from the //Padma Purāṇa,// where it is stated that Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune, after seeing the attractive features of Lord Kṛṣṇa, was attracted to Him, and to get the favor of Lord Kṛṣṇa she engaged herself in meditation. When asked by Kṛṣṇa why she engaged in meditation with austerity, Lakṣmīdevī answered, "I want to be one of Your associates like the //gopīs// in Vṛndāvana." Hearing this, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa replied that it was quite impossible. Lakṣmīdevī then said that she wanted to remain just like a golden line on the chest of the Lord. The Lord granted the request, and since then Lakṣmī has always been situated on the chest of Lord Kṛṣṇa as a golden line. The austerity and meditation of Lakṣmīdevī are also mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.16.36), where the Nāga-patnīs, the wives of the serpent Kāliya, in the course of their prayers to Kṛṣṇa, said that the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, also wanted His association as a //gopī// and desired the dust of His lotus feet.
