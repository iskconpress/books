This is a verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:3:1|(1.3.1)]]. The commentary of Madhva on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// mentions that the following sixteen spiritual energies are present in the spiritual world: (1) //śrī,// (2) //bhū,// (3) //līlā,// (4) //kānti,// (5) //kīrti,// (6) //tuṣṭi,// (7) //gīr,// (8) //puṣṭi,// (9) //satyā// (10) //jñānājñānā,// (11) //jayā utkarṣiṇī,// (12) //vimalā,// (13) //yogamāyā,// (14) //prahvī,// (15) //īśānā// and (16) //anugrahā.// In his commentary on the //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta,// Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has said that the above energies are also known by nine names: (1) //vimalā,// (2) //utkarṣiṇī// (3) //jñānā,// (4) //kriyā,// (5) //yogā,// (6) //prahvī,// (7) //satyā,// (8) //īśānā// and (9) //anugrahā.// In the //Bhagavat-sandarbha// of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī (//Anuccheda// 103) they are described as //śrī, puṣṭi, gīr, kānti, kīrti, tuṣṭi, ilā, jaya; vidyāvidyā, māyā, samvit, sandhinī, hlādinī, bhakti, mūrti, vimalā, yogā, prahvī, īśānā, anugrahā,// etc. All these energies act in different spheres of the Lord's supremacy.
