Among the //sannyāsīs// of the Śaṅkara-sampradāya there are different names for //brahmacārīs.// Each //sannyāsī// has some assistants, known as //brahmacārīs,// who are called by different names according to the names of the //sannyāsī.// Among such //brahmacārīs// there are four names: Svarūpa, Ānanda, Prakāśa and Caitanya. Nityānanda Prabhu maintained Himself as a //brahmacārī;// He never took //sannyāsa.// As a //brahmacārī// His name was Nityānanda Svarūpa, and therefore the //sannyāsī// under whom He was living must have been from the //tīrthas// or //āśramas.//
