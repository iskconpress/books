Outside of Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Kṛṣṇa, which is called //paravyoma,// is the glaring effulgence of Kṛṣṇa's bodily rays. This is called the //brahmajyoti.// The transcendental region of that effulgence is called Siddhaloka or Brahmaloka. When impersonalists achieve liberation, they merge into that Brahmaloka effulgence. This transcendental region is undoubtedly spiritual, but it contains no manifestations of spiritual activities or variegatedness. It is compared to the glow of the sun. Within the sun's glow is the sphere of the sun, where one can experience all sorts of varieties.
