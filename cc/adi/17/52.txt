There are many tantric followers who practice the black art of worshiping the goddess Bhavānī in a crematorium, wishing to eat meat and drink wine. Such fools also consider this //bhavānī-pūjā// as good as worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa in devotional service. Such abominable tantric activities performed by so-called //svāmīs// and //yogīs// are herein condemned, however, by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He declares that such //bhavānī-pūjā// for drinking wine and eating meat quickly plunges one into hellish life. The method of worship itself is already hellish, and its results must also be hellish and nothing more.

Many rascals say that whatever way one accepts, one will ultimately reach Brahman. Yet we can see from this verse how such persons reach Brahman. Brahman spreads everywhere, but appreciation of Brahman in different objects leads to different results. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]] the Lord says, //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham:// "I reward everyone according to his surrender unto Me." Māyāvādīs certainly realize Brahman in certain aspects, but realization of Brahman in the aspects of wine, women and meat is not the same realization of Brahman that devotees achieve by chanting, dancing and eating //prasāda.// Māyāvādī philosophers, being educated in paltry knowledge, think all sorts of Brahman realization one and the same and do not consider varieties. But although Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, by His inconceivable potency He is simultaneously not everywhere. Thus the Brahman realization of the tantric cult is not the same Brahman realization as that of pure devotees. Unless one reaches the highest point of Brahman realization, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is punishable. All people except Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees are to some proportion //pāṣaṇḍīs,// or demons, and thus they are punishable by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, as stated below.
