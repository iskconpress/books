**The Kazi said, "To as many descendants as take birth in my dynasty in the future, I give this grave admonition: No one should check the saṅkīrtana movement."**

===== Purport =====

As a result of this grave injunction by the Kazi, even at present the descendants of the Kazi's family do not oppose the //saṅkīrtana// movement under any circumstances. Even during the great Hindu-Muslim riots in neighboring places, the descendants of the Kazi honestly preserved the assurance given by their forefather.
