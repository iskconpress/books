In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes in his //Anubhāṣya,// "Śrī Gaurasundara is Kṛṣṇa Himself with the attitude of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never gave up the attitude of the //gopīs.// He remained everlastingly predominated by Kṛṣṇa and never accepted the part of the predominator by imitating conjugal love with an ordinary woman, as //sahajiyās// generally do. He never placed Himself in the position of a debauchee. Lusty materialists like the members of the //sahajiyā-sampradāya// hanker after women, even others' wives. But when they try to ascribe the responsibility for their lusty activities to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they become offenders to Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. In //Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata, Ādi-khaṇḍa,// Chapter Fifteen, it is said:

> sabe para-strīra prati nāhi parihāsa
> strī dekhi' dūre prabhu hayena eka-pāśa

'Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never even joked with others' wives. As soon as He saw a woman coming, He would immediately give her ample room to pass without talking.' He was extremely strict regarding the association of women. The //sahajiyās,// however, pose as followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu although they indulge in lusty affairs with women. In His youth Lord Caitanya was very humorous with everyone, but He never joked with any woman, nor in this incarnation did He talk about women. The //gaurāṅga-nāgarī// party is not approved by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Even though one may offer all kinds of prayers to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one should strictly avoid worshiping Him as the Gaurāṅga Nāgara. The personal behavior of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the verses written by Śrī Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura have completely repudiated the lusty desires of the //gaurāṅga-nāgarīs.//"
