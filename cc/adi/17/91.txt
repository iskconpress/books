===== Purport =====

The //Caitanya-maṅgala, Madhya-khaṇḍa,// describes this incident as follows: Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita was performing the //śrāddha// ceremony of his father, and as is customary, he was hearing the thousand names of Lord Viṣṇu. At that time Gaurahari (Lord Caitanya) appeared on the scene, and He also began to hear the thousand names of Viṣṇu with full satisfaction. When He thus heard the holy name of Lord Nṛsiṁha, Lord Caitanya became absorbed in thought, and He became angry like Nṛsiṁha Prabhu in His angry mood. His eyes became red, His hairs stood on end, all the parts of His body trembled, and He made a thundering sound. All of a sudden He took up a club, and people became greatly afraid, thinking, "We do not know what kind of offense we have now committed!" But then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu adjusted His thoughts and sat down on His seat.
