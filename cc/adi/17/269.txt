According to the system of Vedic society, whenever an unknown //sannyāsī// comes to a village or town, someone must invite him to take //prasāda// in his home. //Sannyāsīs// generally take //prasāda// in the house of a //brāhmaṇa// because the //brāhmaṇa// worships the Lord Nārāyaṇa //śilā,// or //śālagrāma-śilā,// and therefore there is //prasāda// that the //sannyāsī// may take. Keśava Bhāratī accepted the invitation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus the Lord had a good opportunity to explain His desire to take //sannyāsa// from him.
