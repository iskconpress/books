===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gayā to offer respectful oblations to His forefathers. This process is called //piṇḍa-dāna.// In Vedic society, after the death of a relative, especially one's father or mother, one must go to Gayā and there offer oblations to the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore hundreds and thousands of men gather in Gayā daily to offer such oblations, or //śrāddha.// Following this principle, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu also went there to offer //piṇḍa// to His dead father. Fortunately He met Īśvara Purī there.
