The Kazi had issued an order not to perform //kīrtana,// congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord. But when this was brought up to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He ordered civil disobedience to the Kazi's order. Lord Caitanya and all His devotees, naturally enthusiastic although agitated, must have made a great noise with their loud cries.
