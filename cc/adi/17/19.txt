===== Purport =====

One day Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to cry out, "Śūkara! Śūkara!" Thus crying out for the boar incarnation of the Lord, He assumed His form as the boar incarnation and got up on the shoulders of Murāri Gupta. He carried a small //gāḍu,// a small waterpot with a nozzle, and thus He symbolically picked up the earth from the depths of the ocean, for this is the pastime of Lord Varāha.
