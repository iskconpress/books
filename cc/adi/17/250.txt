===== Purport =====

It is mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that when Uddhava came from Lord Kṛṣṇa with a message for the //gopīs,// all the //gopīs,// especially Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, denounced Kṛṣṇa in various ways. Such denunciations, however, reflect an exuberant loving attitude that an ordinary man cannot understand. When the foolish student questioned Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Caitanya similarly rebuked Lord Kṛṣṇa in loving exuberance. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in the mood of the //gopīs// and the student advocated the cause of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya was greatly angry. Seeing His anger, the foolish student, who was an ordinary atheistic //smārta-brāhmaṇa,// foolishly misjudged Him. Thus he and a party of students were ready to strike the Lord in retaliation. After this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to take //sannyāsa// so that people would not commit offenses against Him, considering Him an ordinary householder, for in India even now a //sannyāsī// is naturally offered respect.
