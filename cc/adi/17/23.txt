===== Purport =====

To emphasize something to an ordinary person, one may repeat it three times, just as one might say, "You must do this! You must do this! You must do this!" Thus the //Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa// repeatedly emphasizes the chanting of the holy name so that people may take it seriously and thus free themselves from the clutches of //māyā.// It is our practical experience in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world that many millions of people are factually coming to the spiritual stage of life simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// regularly, according to the prescribed principles. Therefore our request to all our students is that they daily chant at least sixteen rounds of this //harer nāma mahā-mantra// offenselessly, following the regulative principles. Thus their success will be assured without a doubt.
