**In the evening Lord Gaurasundara went out and formed three parties to perform kīrtana.**

===== Purport =====

This is a scheme for performing //kīrtana// in a procession. During Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's time, one party was composed of twenty-one men: four people playing //mṛdaṅgas,// one leading the chanting, and sixteen others striking //karatālas,// responding to the leading chanter. If many men join the //saṅkīrtana// movement, they may follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and form different parties according to the time and the number of men available.
