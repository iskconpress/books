The word //ṭhākura// has two meanings. One meaning is "God" or "a godly person," and another meaning is "//kṣatriya.//" Here the //pāṣaṇḍī brāhmaṇas// address the Kazi as //ṭhākura,// considering him the ruler of the town. There are different names by which to address the members of different castes. The //brāhmaṇas// are addressed as //mahārāja,// the //kṣatriyas// as //ṭhākura,// the //vaiśyas// as //śetha// or //mahājana,// and the //śūdras// as //caudhurī.// This etiquette is still followed in northern India, where the //kṣatriyas// are addressed as Ṭhākura Sāhab. The //pāsaṇḍīs// went so far as to request the magistrate, or Kazi, to have Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expelled from the town because of His introducing //hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.// Fortunately our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement all over the world, especially in the civilized world of Europe and America, has become very popular. Generally no one complains against us to have us removed from a city. Although such an attempt was indeed made in Melbourne, Australia, the attempt failed. Thus we are now introducing this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in great cities of the world like New York, London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu everything is going on nicely. People are happy to accept the principle of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and the result is most satisfactory.
