===== Purport =====

At the end of His twenty-fourth year, at the end of the fortnight of the waxing moon, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left Navadvīpa and crossed the river Ganges at a place known as Nidayāra-ghāṭa. Then He reached Kaṇṭaka-nagara, or Kāṭoyā (Katwa), where He accepted //ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa// according to the Śaṅkarite system. Since Keśava Bhāratī belonged to the Śaṅkarite sect, he could not initiate Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsa// order, whose members carry the //tridaṇḍa.//

Candraśekhara Ācārya assisted in the routine ceremonial work of the Lord's acceptance of //sannyāsa.// By the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //kīrtana// was performed for the entire day, and at the end of the day the Lord shaved off His hair. On the next day He became a regular //sannyāsī,// with one rod (//ekadaṇḍa//). From that day on His name was Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. Before that, He was known as Nimāi Paṇḍita. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in the //sannyāsa// order, traveled all over Rāḍha-deśa, the region where the Ganges River cannot be seen. Keśava Bhāratī accompanied Him for some distance.
