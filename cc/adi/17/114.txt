The incident of Lord Caitanya's meeting the all-knowing astrologer is not mentioned in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata,// but we cannot therefore say that it did not take place. On the contrary, we must accept the statement of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī that whatever the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// did not mention he has especially mentioned in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//
