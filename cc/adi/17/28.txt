This practice of forbearance (//tṛṇād api sunīcena//) is very difficult, but when one actually engages in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// the quality of forbearance automatically develops. A person advanced in spiritual consciousness through the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// need not practice to develop it separately, for a devotee develops all good qualities simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// regularly.
