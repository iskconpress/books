===== Purport =====

Chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is open to everyone, but sometimes nonbelievers come to disturb the ceremony of chanting. It is indicated herein that under such circumstances the temple doors should be closed. Only bona fide chanters should be admitted; others should not. But when there is large-scale congregational chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// we keep our temples for everyone to join, and by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu this policy has given good results.
