Kumbhīpāka, a type of hellish condition, is described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:26:13|(5.26.13)]], wherein it is said that a person who cooks living birds and beasts to satisfy his tongue is brought before Yamarāja after death and punished in the Kumbhīpāka hell. There he is put into boiling oil called //kumbhī-pāka,// from which there is no deliverance. Kumbhīpāka is meant for persons who are unnecessarily envious. Those who are envious of the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are punished in that hellish condition.
