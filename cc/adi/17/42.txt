According to the Vedic system there are four castes---the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras//-and below them are the //pañcamas,// who are lower than the //śūdras.// The higher castes---the //brāhmaṇas,// the //kṣatriyas// and even the //vaiśyas//-were known as //brāhmaṇa-saj-jana.// The //brāhmaṇas// especially were known as //sajjana,// or respectable gentlemen who guided the entire society. If there were disputes in the village, people would approach these respectable //brāhmaṇas// to settle them. Now it is very difficult to find such //brāhmaṇas// and //saj-janas,// and thus every village and town is so disrupted that there is no peace and happiness anywhere. To revive a fully cultured civilization, the scientific division of society into //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras// must be introduced all over the world. Unless some people are trained as //brāhmaṇas,// there cannot be peace in human society.
