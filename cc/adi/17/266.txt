===== Purport =====

According to Vedic injunctions, only a //brāhmaṇa// may be offered //sannyāsa.// The Śaṅkara-sampradāya (//ekadaṇḍa-sannyāsa-sampradāya//) awards the //sannyāsa// order only to caste //brāhmaṇas,// or born //brāhmaṇas,// but in the Vaiṣṇava system even one not born in a //brāhmaṇa// family may be made a //brāhmaṇa// according to the direction of the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (//tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām//). Any person from any part of the world may be made a //brāhmaṇa// by the regular process of initiation, and when he follows brahminical behavior, observing the principle of abstaining from intoxication, illicit sex, meat-eating and gambling, he may be offered //sannyāsa.// All the //sannyāsīs// in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, who are preaching all over the world, are regular //brāhmaṇa-sannyāsīs.// Thus the so-called caste //brāhmaṇas// should not object to offering them respectful obeisances. By offering such obeisances, as recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they will diminish their offenses and automatically awaken to their natural position of devotional service. As it is said, //nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema sādhya kabhu naya:kṛṣṇa-prema// can be awakened in a purified heart. The more we offer obeisances to //sannyāsīs,// especially Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// the more we diminish our offenses and purify our hearts. Only in a purified heart can //kṛṣṇa-prema// awaken. This is the process of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's cult, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.
