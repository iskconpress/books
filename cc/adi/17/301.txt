In verses 296 through 301 the emotional devoted service of Śrī Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita Prabhu and others has been fully described. Describing such individual service, the //Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā,// verses 11 through 16, declares that although Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared as a devotee, He is none other than the son of Nanda Mahārāja. Similarly, although Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu appeared as Lord Caitanya's assistant, He is none other than Baladeva, the carrier of the plow. Advaita Ācārya is the incarnation of Sadāśiva from the spiritual world. All the devotees headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura are His marginal energy, whereas the devotees headed by Gadādhara Paṇḍita are manifestations of His internal potency.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Advaita Prabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu all belong to the //viṣṇu-tattva// category. Because Lord Caitanya is an ocean of mercy, He is addressed as //mahāprabhu,// whereas Nityānanda and Advaita, being two great personalities who assist Lord Caitanya, are addressed as //prabhu.// Thus there are two //prabhus// and one //mahāprabhu.// Gadādhara Gosvāmī is a representative of a perfect //brāhmaṇa// spiritual master. Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura represents a perfect //brāhmaṇa// devotee. These five are known as the Pañca-tattva.
