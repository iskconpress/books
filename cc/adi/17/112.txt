It appears that the astrologer not only was a knower of past, present and future through astrological calculation, but was a great meditator as well. Therefore he was a great devotee and could see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be the same personality as Kṛṣṇa. He was puzzled, however, about whether Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were actually the same person.
