In our practical preaching work we meet many Christians who talk about statements of the Bible. When we question whether God is limited or unlimited, Christian priests say that God is unlimited. But when we question why the unlimited God should have only one son and not unlimited sons, they are unable to answer. Similarly, from a scientific point of view, the answers of the Old Testament, New Testament and Koran to many questions have changed. But a //śāstra// cannot change at a person's whim. All //śāstras// must be free from the four defects of human nature. The statements of //śāstras// must be correct for all time.
