Sometimes demoniac nonbelievers, not understanding the potency of the holy name, make fun of the Vaiṣṇavas when the Vaiṣṇavas chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// This joking is also beneficial for such persons. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Canto, Second Chapter, verse 14, indicates that the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// even in joking, in the course of ordinary discussion, in indicating something extraneous, or in negligence, is called //nāmābhāsa,// which is chanting that is almost on the transcendental stage. This //nāmābhāsa// stage is better than //nāmāparādha. Nāmābhāsa// awakens the supreme remembrance of Lord Viṣṇu. When one remembers Lord Viṣṇu, he becomes free from material enjoyment. Thus he gradually comes forward toward the transcendental service of the Lord and becomes eligible to chant the holy name of the Lord in the transcendental position.
