In the Deity's room there must be a bed for the Deity behind the Deity's throne. (This system should immediately be introduced in all our centers. It does not matter whether the bed is big or small; it should be of a size the Deity room can conveniently accommodate, but there must be at least a small bed.) One day in the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down on the bed of Viṣṇu, and all the devotees worshiped Him with the Vedic //mantras// of the //Puruṣa-sūkta,// beginning with //sahasra-śīrṣā puruṣaḥ sahasrākṣaḥ sahasra-pāt.// This //veda-stuti// should also be introduced, if possible, for installations of Deities. While bathing the Deity, all the priests and devotees must chant this //Puruṣa-sūkta// and offer the appropriate paraphernalia for worshiping the Deity, such as flowers, fruits, incense, //ārati// paraphernalia, //naivedya, vastra// and ornaments. All the devotees worshiped Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in this way, and the Lord remained in ecstasy for seven //praharas,// or twenty-one hours. He took this opportunity to show the devotees that He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the source of all other incarnations, as confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]]: //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.// All the different forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or //viṣṇu-tattva,// emanate from the body of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu exposed all the private desires of the devotees, and thus all of them became fully confident that Lord Caitanya is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Some devotees call this exhibition of ecstasy by the Lord //sāta-prahariyā bhāva,// or "the ecstasy of twenty-one hours," and others call it //mahābhāva-prakāśa// or //mahā-prakāśa.// There are other descriptions of this //sāta-prahariyā bhāva// in the //Caitanya-bhāvagata,// Chapter Nine, which mentions that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu blessed a maidservant named Duḥkhī with the name Sukhī. He called for Kholāvecā Śrīdhara, and showed him His //mahā-prakāśa.// Then He called for Murāri Gupta and showed him His feature as Lord Rāmacandra. He offered His blessings to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and at this time He also asked Advaita Prabhu to explain the //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is (//gītāra satya-pāṭha//) and showed special favor to Mukunda.
