===== Purport =====

In this verse we find the word //dvija,// indicating that the student was a //brāhmaṇa.// Actually, in those days, only members of the //brāhmaṇa// class became students of Vedic literature. Schooling is meant especially for //brāhmaṇas;// previously there was no question of schooling for //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// or //śūdras. Kṣatriyas// used to learn the technology of warfare, and //vaiśyas// learned business from their fathers or other businessmen; they were not meant to study the //Vedas.// At present, however, everyone goes to school, and everyone is given the same type of education, although no one knows what the result will be. The result, however, is most unsatisfactory, as we have seen in the Western countries especially. The United States has vast educational institutions where everyone is allowed to receive an education, but the result is that most students become like hippies.

Higher education is not meant for everyone. Only selected individuals trained in brahminical culture should be allowed to pursue a higher education. Educational institutions should not aim to teach technology, for a technologist cannot properly be called educated. A technologist is a //śūdra;// only one who studies the //Vedas// may properly be called a learned man (//paṇḍita//). The duty of a //brāhmaṇa// is to become learned in the Vedic literature and teach the Vedic knowledge to other //brāhmaṇas.// In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we are simply teaching our students to become fit //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas. In our school at Dallas, the students are learning English and Sanskrit, and through these two languages they are studying all our books, such as //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītāAs It Is// and //The Nectar of Devotion.// It is a mistake to educate every student as a technologist. There must be a group of students who become //brāhmaṇas.// Without //brāhmaṇas// who study the Vedic literature, human society will be entirely chaotic.
