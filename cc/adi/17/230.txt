Nārāyaṇī was a niece of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, and later she became the mother of Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. In this connection the //sahajiyās// cite a malicious story that after eating the remnants of Lord Caitanya's food Nārāyaṇī became pregnant and gave birth to Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. The rascal //sahajiyās// may manufacture such false statements, but no one should believe them because they are motivated by enmity against the Vaiṣṇavas.
