In this connection Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that once when Lord Caitanya was performing //saṅkīrtana// a short way from the village, some clouds appeared overhead. By the supreme will of the Lord, the clouds were asked to disperse, and they did. Because of this incident, that place is still known as Meghera-cara. Since the course of the Ganges has now changed, the village of the name Belapukhuriyā, which was formerly situated in a different place, called Tāraṇavāsa, has now become known as the Meghera-cara. The //Madhya-khaṇḍa// of the //Caitanya-maṅgala// also relates that once at the end of the day, when evening clouds assembled overhead and thundered threateningly, all the Vaiṣṇavas were very much afraid. But the Lord took His //karatālas// in His hands and personally began chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// looking up towards the sky as if to direct the demigods in the higher planets. Thus all the assembled clouds dispersed, and as the sky became clear, with the moon rising, the Lord began dancing very happily with His jubilant and satisfied devotees.
