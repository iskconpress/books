Brāhmaṇas generally used to become astrologers, Āyur-vedic physicians, teachers and priests. Although highly learned and respectable, such //brāhmaṇas// went from door to door to distribute their knowledge. A //brāhmaṇa// would first go to a householder's home to give information about the functions to be performed on a particular //tithi,// or date, but if there were sickness in the family, the family members would consult the //brāhmaṇa as// a physician, and the //brāhmaṇa// would give instruction and some medicine. Often, since the //brāhmaṇas// were expert in astrology, people would also be greatly inquisitive about their past, present and future.

Although the //brāhmaṇa// appeared at Lord Caitanya's house as a beggar, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu received him with great respect because he was a qualified //brāhmaṇa// who knew the astrological science perfectly. Although //brāhmaṇas// would go door to door just like beggars, they were honored as very respectable guests. This was the system in Hindu society five hundred years ago, during the time of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This system was current even one hundred years ago; even fifty or sixty years ago, when we were children, such //brāhmaṇas// would visit householders like humble beggars, and people would derive great benefit from the mercy of such //brāhmaṇas.// The greatest benefit was that a householder could save a great deal of money from being spent on doctor bills because the //brāhmaṇas,// aside from explaining the past, present and future, could ordinarily cure all kinds of diseases simply by giving instructions and some medicine. Thus no one was bereft of the benefit of a first-class physician, astrologer and priest. The important members of ISKCON should give careful attention to our Dallas school, where children are being taught Sanskrit and English to become perfect //brāhmaṇas.// If they are actually trained as perfect //brāhmaṇas,// they can save society from rogues and ruffians; indeed, people can live happily under the protection of qualified //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]] gives special stress to the division of society (//cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ//). Unfortunately some people are now claiming to be //brāhmaṇas// simply by birthright, with no qualifications. Therefore the entire society is in chaos.
