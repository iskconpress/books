In the list of offenses in the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, it is said, //dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ:// to consider the chanting of the holy name of the Lord equal to the execution of some auspicious religious ceremony is an offense. According to the materialistic point of view, observing a religious ceremony invokes an auspicious atmosphere for the material benefit of the entire world. Materialists therefore manufacture religious principles to live comfortably and without disturbance in executing their material activities. Since they do not believe in the existence of God, they have manufactured the idea that God is impersonal and that to have some conception of God one may imagine any form. Thus they respect the many forms of the demigods as different representations or manifestations of the Lord. They are called //bahv-īśvara-vādīs, or// followers of thousands and thousands of gods. They consider the chanting of the names of the demigods an auspicious activity. Great so-called //svāmīs// have written books saying that one may chant any name-Durgā, Kālī, Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, and so on-because any name is all right for invoking an auspicious atmosphere in society. Thus they are called //pāṣaṇḍīs//-unbelievers or faithless demons.

Such //pāṣaṇḍīs// do not know the actual value of the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Foolishly proud of their material birth as //brāhmaṇas// and their consequently higher position in the social order, they think of the other classes-namely, the //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras//-as lower classes. According to them, no one but the //brāhmaṇas// can chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, for if others chanted the holy name, its potency would be reduced. They are unaware of the potency of Lord Kṛṣṇa's name. The //Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa// recommends:

> harer nāma harer nāma
> harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva
> nāsty eva gatir anyathā

"For spiritual progress in this age of Kali, there is no alternative, no alternative, no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord." The //pāṣaṇḍīs// do not accept that the potency of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so great that one can be delivered simply by chanting the holy name, although this is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.3.51): //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.// Any man from any part of the world who practices chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa can be liberated and after death go back home, back to Godhead. The rascal //pāṣaṇḍīs// think that if anyone but a //brāhmaṇa// chants the holy name, the potency of the holy name is vanquished. According to their judgment, instead of delivering the fallen souls, the potency of the holy name is reduced. Believing in the existence of many gods and considering the chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa no better than other hymns, these //pāṣaṇḍīs// do not believe in the words of the //śāstra// (//harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam//). But Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms in His //Śikṣāṣṭaka, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:// one must chant the holy name of the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day. The //pāṣaṇḍīs,// however, are so fallen and falsely proud of having taken birth in //brāhmaṇa// families that they think that instead of delivering all the fallen souls, the holy name becomes impotent when constantly chanted by lower-class men.

Significant in verse 211 are the words //kṛṣṇera kīrtana kare nīca bāḍa bāḍa,// indicating that anyone can join in the //saṅkīrtana// movement. This is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:4:18|(2.4.18)]]: //kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ.// This is a list of the names of //caṇḍālas.// The //pāṣaṇḍīs// say that when these lower-class men are allowed to chant, their influence is enhanced. They do not like the idea that others should also develop spiritual qualities, because this would curb their false pride in having taken birth in families of the elevated //brāhmaṇa// caste, with a monopoly on spiritual activities. But despite all protests from so-called Hindus and members of the //brāhmaṇa// caste, we are propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world, according to the injunctions of the //śāstras// and the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus we are sure that we are delivering many fallen souls, making them bona fide candidates for going back home, back to Godhead.
