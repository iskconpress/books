**In Gayā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was initiated by Īśvara Purī, and immediately afterwards He exhibited signs of love of Godhead. He again displayed such symptoms after returning home.**

===== Purport =====

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Gayā, accompanied by many of His disciples, He became sick on the way. He had such a high fever that He asked His students to bring water that had washed the feet of //brāhmaṇas,// and when they brought it the Lord drank it and was cured. Therefore everyone should respect the position of a //brāhmaṇa,// as indicated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Neither the Lord nor His followers displayed any disrespect to //brāhmaṇas.//

The followers of the Lord must be prepared to offer //brāhmaṇas// all due respect. But preachers of Lord Caitanya's cult object if someone presents himself as a //brāhmaṇa// without having the necessary qualifications. The followers of Lord Caitanya cannot blindly accept that everyone born in a //brāhmaṇa// family is a //brāhmaṇa.// Therefore one should not indiscriminately follow the Lord's example of showing respect to //brāhmaṇas// by drinking water that has washed their feet. Gradually the //brāhmaṇa// families have become degraded because of the contamination of Kali-yuga. Thus they misguide people by exploiting their sentiments.
