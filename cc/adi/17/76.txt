Karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs, tapasvīs and students of Vedic literature who do not have Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply beat around the bush and do not get any final profit because they have no clear knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nor do they have faith in approaching Him by discharging devotional service, although everywhere such service is repeatedly emphasized, as it is in this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.14.20). The //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:55|(Bg. 18.55)]] also declares, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ:// "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." If one wants to understand the Supreme Personality factually, he must take to the path of devotional service and not waste time in profitless philosophical speculation, fruitive activity, mystic yogic practice or severe austerity and penance. Elsewhere in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:12:5|(Bg. 12.5)]] the Lord confirms, //kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām:// "For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome." People who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Lord are obliged to take great trouble, yet nevertheless they cannot understand the Absolute Truth. As explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:11|(1.2.11)]], //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.// Unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original source of both Brahman and Paramātmā, one is still in darkness about the Absolute Truth.
