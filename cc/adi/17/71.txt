===== Purport =====

On the //mahā-prakāśa// day, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Haridāsa Ṭhākura and informed him that he was none other than an incarnation of Prahlāda Mahārāja. When Viśvarūpa took //sannyāsa,// Śacīmātā thought that Advaita Ācārya had persuaded Him to do so. Therefore she accused Him of this, which was an offense at Advaita Ācārya's lotus feet. Later Lord Caitanya induced His mother to take the dust of Advaita Ācārya's lotus feet, and thus her //vaiṣṇava-aparādha// was nullified.
