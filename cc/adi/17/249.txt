It is said, //vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:// no one can understand the activities of a pure devotee. A student or neophyte devotee could not possibly understand why Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was chanting the name of the //gopīs,// nor should the student have asked the Lord about the potency of chanting "Gopī, Gopī." The neophyte student was certainlv convinced of the piety in the chanting of Kṛṣṇa's holy name, but this sort of attitude is also offensive. //Dharma-vrata-tyāga-hutādi-sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ:// to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in exchange for the achievement of piety is an offense. This, of course, was unknown to the student. Thus he innocently asked, "What piety is there in the chanting of the name Gopī?" //He// did not know that there is no question of piety or impiety. The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa or the holy name Gopī is on the transcendental platform of loving affairs. Since he was not expert in understanding such transcendental activities, his question was merely impudent. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, apparently greatly angry at him, reacted as follows.
