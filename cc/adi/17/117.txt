Yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā is the pastime of attracting Yamunā. One day, Śrī Baladeva wanted the Yamunā River to come before Him, and when the river Yamunā refused, He took His plow, wanting to dig a canal so that Yamunā would be obliged to come there. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the original form of Baladeva, in His ecstasy He asked everyone to bring honey. In this way, all the devotees standing there saw the //yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā.// In this //līlā,// Baladeva was accompanied by His girlfriends. After drinking a honey beverage called Vāruṇī, He wanted to jump into the Yamunā and swim with the girls. It is stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.65.25-30, 33) that Lord Baladeva asked Yamunā to come near, and when the river disobeyed the, order of the Lord, He became angry and thus wanted to snatch her near to Him with His plow. Yamunā, however, very much afraid of Lord Balarāma's anger, immediately came and surrendered unto Him, praying to the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and admitting her fault. She was then excused. This is the sum and substance of the //yamunākarṣaṇa-līlā.// The incident is also described in the prayer of Jayadeva Gosvāmī concerning the ten incarnations:

> vahasi vapuṣi viśade vasanaṁ jaladābhaṁ
> halahati-bhīti-milita-yamunābham
> keśava dhṛta-haladhara-rūpa jaya jagad-īśa hare
