===== Purport =====

Śrī Kṛṣṇa's beauty attracted the eyes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇa's singing and the vibration of His flute attracted the Lord's ears, the transcendental fragrance of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet attracted His nostrils, Kṛṣṇa's transcendental sweetness attracted His tongue, and Kṛṣṇa's bodily touch attracted the Lord's sensation of touch. Thus each of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's five senses was attracted by one of the five attributes of Lord Kṛṣṇa.
