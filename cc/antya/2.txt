~~Title:Cc. Antya 2: The Chastisement of Junior Haridāsa~~

====== The Chastisement of Junior Haridāsa ======

The purport of this chapter is explained by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya// as follows. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, the author of //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// wanted to explain direct meetings with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, meetings with those empowered by Him, and His //āvirbhāva// appearance. Thus he described the glories of Nṛsiṁhānanda and other devotees. A devotee named Bhagavān Ācārya was exceptionally faithful to the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Nevertheless, his brother, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Ācārya, discoursed upon the commentary of impersonalism (Māyāvāda). Śrīla Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, the secretary of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, forbid Bhagavān Ācārya to indulge in hearing that commentary. Later, when Junior Haridāsa, following the order of Bhagavān Ācārya, went to collect alms from Mādhavīdevī, he committed an offense by talking intimately with a woman although he was in the renounced order. Because of this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected Junior Haridāsa, and despite all the requests of the Lord's stalwart devotees, the Lord did not accept him again. One year after this incident, Junior Haridāsa went to the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā and committed suicide. In his spiritual body, however, he continued to sing devotional songs, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard them. When the Vaiṣṇavas of Bengal went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, these incidents became known to Svarūpa Dāmodara and others.

  ; [[.2:1|Cc. Antya 2.1]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master and of all the other preceptors on the path of devotional service. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇavas and unto the six Gosvāmīs, including Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī and their associates. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and all His devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. I then offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and all the gopīs, headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.

  ; [[.2:2|Cc. Antya 2.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[.2:3|Cc. Antya 2.3]]
  : In His incarnation as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descended to deliver all the living beings in the three worlds, from Brahmaloka down to Pātālaloka. He caused their deliverance in three ways.

  ; [[.2:4|Cc. Antya 2.4]]
  : The Lord delivered the fallen souls in some places by meeting them directly, in other places by empowering a pure devotee, and in still other places by appearing before someone Himself.

  ; [[.2:5-6|Cc. Antya 2.5-6]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered almost all the fallen souls by directly meeting them. He delivered others by entering the body of Nakula Brahmacārī and by appearing before Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī. "I shall deliver the fallen souls." This statement characterizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.2:7|Cc. Antya 2.7]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was personally present, anyone in the world who met Him even once was fully satisfied and became spiritually advanced.

  ; [[.2:8|Cc. Antya 2.8]]
  : Every year, devotees from Bengal would go to Jagannātha Purī to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and after the meeting they would return to Bengal.

  ; [[.2:9|Cc. Antya 2.9]]
  : Similarly, people who went to Jagannātha Purī from various provinces of India were fully satisfied after seeing the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:10|Cc. Antya 2.10]]
  : People from all over the universe, including the seven islands, the nine khaṇḍas, the planets of the demigods, Gandharvaloka and Kinnaraloka, would go there in the forms of human beings.

  ; [[.2:11|Cc. Antya 2.11]]
  : Having seen the Lord, they all became Vaiṣṇavas. Thus they danced and chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra in ecstatic love of Godhead.

  ; [[.2:12|Cc. Antya 2.12]]
  : Thus by direct meetings, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered the three worlds. Some people, however, could not go and were entangled in material activities.

  ; [[.2:13|Cc. Antya 2.13]]
  : To deliver people in regions throughout the universe who could not meet Him, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally entered the bodies of pure devotees.

  ; [[.2:14|Cc. Antya 2.14]]
  : Thus He empowered living beings [His pure devotees] by manifesting in them so much of His own devotion that people in all other countries became devotees by seeing them.

  ; [[.2:15|Cc. Antya 2.15]]
  : In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered the entire three worlds, not only by His personal presence but also by empowering others. I shall briefly describe how He empowered a living being in Bengal.

  ; [[.2:16|Cc. Antya 2.16]]
  : In Āmbuyā-muluka there was a person named Nakula Brahmacārī, who was a perfectly pure devotee, greatly advanced in devotional service.

  ; [[.2:17|Cc. Antya 2.17]]
  : Desiring to deliver all the people of Bengal, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the heart of Nakula Brahmacārī.

  ; [[.2:18|Cc. Antya 2.18]]
  : Nakula Brahmacārī became exactly like a man haunted by a ghost. Thus he sometimes laughed, sometimes cried, sometimes danced and sometimes chanted like a madman.

  ; [[.2:19|Cc. Antya 2.19]]
  : He continuously exhibited bodily transformations of transcendental love. Thus he cried, trembled, became stunned, perspired, danced in love of Godhead and made sounds like those of a cloud.

  ; [[.2:20|Cc. Antya 2.20]]
  : His body shone with the same luster as that of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he showed the same absorption in ecstatic love of Godhead. People came from all provinces of Bengal to see these symptoms.

  ; [[.2:21|Cc. Antya 2.21]]
  : He advised whomever he met to chant the holy names Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thus upon seeing him, people were overwhelmed with love of Godhead.

  ; [[.2:22|Cc. Antya 2.22]]
  : When Śivānanda Sena heard that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had entered the body of Nakula Brahmacārī, he went there with doubts in his mind.

  ; [[.2:23|Cc. Antya 2.23]]
  : Desiring to test the authenticity of Nakula Brahmacārī, he stayed outside, thinking as follows.

  ; [[.2:24-25|Cc. Antya 2.24-25]]
  : "If Nakula Brahmacārī personally calls me and knows my worshipable mantra, then I shall understand that he is inspired by the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu." Thinking in this way, he stayed some distance apart.

  ; [[.2:26|Cc. Antya 2.26]]
  : There was a large crowd of people, some coming and some going. Indeed, some people in that great crowd could not even see Nakula Brahmacārī.

  ; [[.2:27|Cc. Antya 2.27]]
  : In his inspired state, Nakula Brahmacārī said, "Śivānanda Sena is staying some distance away. Two or four of you go call him."

  ; [[.2:28|Cc. Antya 2.28]]
  : Thus people began running here and there, calling in all directions, "Śivānanda! Whoever is Śivānanda, please come. Nakula Brahmacārī is calling you."

  ; [[.2:29|Cc. Antya 2.29]]
  : Hearing these calls, Śivānanda Sena quickly went there, offered obeisances to Nakula Brahmacārī, and sat down near him.

  ; [[.2:30|Cc. Antya 2.30]]
  : Nakula Brahmacārī said, "I know that you are doubtful. Now please hear this evidence with great attention.

  ; [[.2:31|Cc. Antya 2.31]]
  : "You are chanting the Gaura-gopāla mantra composed of four syllables. Now please give up the doubts that have resided within you."

  ; [[.2:32|Cc. Antya 2.32]]
  : Śivānanda Sena thereupon developed full confidence in his mind that Nakula Brahmacārī was filled with the presence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śivānanda Sena then offered him respect and devotional service.

  ; [[.2:33|Cc. Antya 2.33]]
  : In this way, one should understand the inconceivable potencies of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now please hear how His appearance [āvirbhāva] takes place.

  ; [[.2:34-35|Cc. Antya 2.34-35]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu always appeared in four places-in the household temple of mother Śacī, in the places where Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu danced, in the house of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita during congregational chanting and in the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita. He appeared because of His attraction to the love of His devotees. That is His natural characteristic.

  ; [[.2:36|Cc. Antya 2.36]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared before Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī and ate his offerings. Please hear about this with attention.

  ; [[.2:37|Cc. Antya 2.37]]
  : Śivānanda Sena had a nephew named Śrīkānta Sena, who by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was extremely fortunate.

  ; [[.2:38|Cc. Antya 2.38]]
  : One year, Śrīkānta Sena came alone to Jagannātha Purī in great eagerness to see the Lord.

  ; [[.2:39|Cc. Antya 2.39]]
  : Seeing Śrīkānta Sena, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bestowed causeless mercy upon him. Śrīkānta Sena stayed near Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for about two months at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.2:40|Cc. Antya 2.40]]
  : When he was about to return to Bengal, the Lord told him, "Forbid the devotees of Bengal to come to Jagannātha Purī this year.

  ; [[.2:41|Cc. Antya 2.41]]
  : "This year I shall personally go to Bengal and meet all the devotees there, headed by Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.2:42|Cc. Antya 2.42]]
  : "Please inform Śivānanda Sena that this December I shall certainly go to his home.

  ; [[.2:43|Cc. Antya 2.43]]
  : "Jagadānanda is there, and he will give Me offerings of food. Inform them all that no one should come to Jagannātha Purī this year."

  ; [[.2:44|Cc. Antya 2.44]]
  : When Śrīkānta Sena returned to Bengal and delivered this message, the minds of all the devotees were very pleased.

  ; [[.2:45|Cc. Antya 2.45]]
  : Advaita Ācārya was just about to go to Jagannātha Purī with the other devotees, but upon hearing this message, He waited. Śivānanda Sena and Jagadānanda also stayed back, awaiting the arrival of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:46|Cc. Antya 2.46]]
  : When the month of Pauṣa arrived, both Jagadānanda and Śivānanda collected all kinds of paraphernalia for the Lord's reception. Every day, they would wait until evening for the Lord to come.

  ; [[.2:47|Cc. Antya 2.47]]
  : As the month passed but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not come, Jagadānanda and Śivānanda became most unhappy.

  ; [[.2:48-49|Cc. Antya 2.48-49]]
  : Suddenly Nṛsiṁhānanda arrived, and Jagadānanda and Śivānanda arranged for him to sit near them. Seeing them both so unhappy, Nṛsiṁhānanda inquired, "Why do I see that you are both despondent?"

  ; [[.2:50|Cc. Antya 2.50]]
  : Then Śivānanda Sena told him, "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu promised that He would come. Why, then, has He not arrived?"

  ; [[.2:51|Cc. Antya 2.51]]
  : Hearing this, Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī replied, "Please be satisfied. I assure you that I shall bring Him here three days from now."

  ; [[.2:52|Cc. Antya 2.52]]
  : Śivānanda and Jagadānanda knew of Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī's influence and love of Godhead. Therefore they now felt assured that he would certainly bring Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:53|Cc. Antya 2.53]]
  : His real name was Pradyumna Brahmacārī. The name Nṛsiṁhānanda had been given to him by Lord Gaurasundara Himself.

  ; [[.2:54|Cc. Antya 2.54]]
  : After meditating for two days, Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī told Śivānanda Sena, "I have already brought Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the village known as Pāṇihāṭi.

  ; [[.2:55|Cc. Antya 2.55]]
  : "Tomorrow at noon He will come to your home. Therefore please bring all kinds of cooking ingredients. I shall personally cook and offer Him food.

  ; [[.2:56|Cc. Antya 2.56]]
  : "In this way I shall bring Him here very soon. Be assured that I am telling you the truth. Do not be doubtful.

  ; [[.2:57|Cc. Antya 2.57]]
  : "Bring all the ingredients very soon, for I want to begin cooking immediately. Please do what I say."

  ; [[.2:58|Cc. Antya 2.58]]
  : Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī said to Śivānanda, "Please bring whatever cooking ingredients I want." Thus Śivānanda Sena immediately brought whatever he asked for.

  ; [[.2:59|Cc. Antya 2.59]]
  : Beginning early in the morning, Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī cooked many varieties of food, including vegetables, cakes, sweet rice and other preparations.

  ; [[.2:60|Cc. Antya 2.60]]
  : After he finished cooking, he brought separate dishes for Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:61|Cc. Antya 2.61]]
  : He also separately offered dishes to Nṛsiṁhadeva, his worshipable Deity. Thus he divided all the food into three offerings. Then, outside the temple, he began to meditate upon the Lord.

  ; [[.2:62|Cc. Antya 2.62]]
  : In his meditation he saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu quickly come, sit down and eat all three offerings, leaving behind no remnants.

  ; [[.2:63|Cc. Antya 2.63]]
  : Pradyumna Brahmacārī was overwhelmed by transcendental ecstasy upon seeing Caitanya Mahāprabhu eating everything. Thus tears flowed from his eyes. Nevertheless, he expressed dismay, saying, "Alas, alas! My dear Lord, what are You doing? You are eating everyone's food!

  ; [[.2:64|Cc. Antya 2.64]]
  : "My dear Lord, You are one with Jagannātha; therefore I have no objection to Your eating His offering. But why are You touching the offering to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva?

  ; [[.2:65|Cc. Antya 2.65]]
  : "I think that Nṛsiṁhadeva could not eat anything today, and therefore He is fasting. If the master fasts, how can the servant live?"

  ; [[.2:66|Cc. Antya 2.66]]
  : Although Nṛsiṁha Brahmacārī felt jubilation within his heart to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu eating everything, for the sake of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva he externally expressed disappointment.

  ; [[.2:67|Cc. Antya 2.67]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Therefore there is no difference between Him, Lord Jagannātha and Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva.

  ; [[.2:68|Cc. Antya 2.68]]
  : Pradyumna Brahmacārī was deeply eager to understand this fact. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu revealed it to him by a practical demonstration.

  ; [[.2:69|Cc. Antya 2.69]]
  : After eating all the offerings, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started for Pāṇihāṭi. There, He was greatly satisfied to see the different varieties of vegetables prepared in the house of Rāghava.

  ; [[.2:70|Cc. Antya 2.70]]
  : Śivānanda said to Nṛsiṁhānanda, "Why are you expressing dismay?" Nṛsiṁhānanda replied, "Just see the behavior of your Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:71|Cc. Antya 2.71]]
  : "He alone has eaten the offerings for all three Deities. Because of this, both Jagannātha and Nṛsiṁhadeva remain fasting."

  ; [[.2:72|Cc. Antya 2.72]]
  : When Śivānanda Sena heard this statement, he was unsure whether Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī was speaking that way because of ecstatic love or because it was actually a fact.

  ; [[.2:73|Cc. Antya 2.73]]
  : When Śivānanda Sena was thus perplexed, Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī said to him, "Bring more food. Let me cook again for Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva."

  ; [[.2:74|Cc. Antya 2.74]]
  : Then Śivānanda Sena again brought the ingredients with which to cook, and Pradyumna Brahmacārī again cooked and offered the food to Nṛsiṁhadeva.

  ; [[.2:75|Cc. Antya 2.75]]
  : The next year, Śivānanda went to Jagannātha Purī with all the other devotees to see the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:76|Cc. Antya 2.76]]
  : One day, in the presence of all the devotees, the Lord raised these topics concerning Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī and praised his transcendental qualities.

  ; [[.2:77|Cc. Antya 2.77]]
  : The Lord said, "Last year in the month of Pauṣa, when Nṛsiṁhānanda gave me varieties of sweetmeats and vegetables to eat, they were so good that I had never before eaten such preparations."

  ; [[.2:78|Cc. Antya 2.78]]
  : Hearing this, all the devotees were struck with wonder, and Śivānanda became confident that the incident was true.

  ; [[.2:79|Cc. Antya 2.79]]
  : In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to eat at the temple of Śacīmātā every day and also visit the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura when kīrtana was performed.

  ; [[.2:80|Cc. Antya 2.80]]
  : Similarly, He was always present when Nityānanda Prabhu danced, and He regularly appeared at the house of Rāghava.

  ; [[.2:81|Cc. Antya 2.81]]
  : Lord Gaurasundara is greatly influenced by the love of His devotees. Therefore wherever there is pure devotion to the Lord, the Lord Himself, subdued by such love, appears, and His devotees see Him.

  ; [[.2:82|Cc. Antya 2.82]]
  : Influenced by the loving affairs of Śivānanda Sena, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came again and again. Therefore who can estimate the limits of his love?

  ; [[.2:83|Cc. Antya 2.83]]
  : Thus I have described the appearance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Anyone who hears about these incidents can understand the transcendental opulence of the Lord.

  ; [[.2:84|Cc. Antya 2.84]]
  : At Jagannātha Purī, in the association of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, lived Bhagavān Ācārya, who was certainly a gentleman, a learned scholar and a great devotee.

  ; [[.2:85|Cc. Antya 2.85]]
  : He was fully absorbed in thoughts of fraternal relationships with God. He was an incarnation of a cowherd boy, and thus his dealings with Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī were very friendly.

  ; [[.2:86|Cc. Antya 2.86]]
  : He sought the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with full surrender. Sometimes he would invite the Lord to dine at his home.

  ; [[.2:87|Cc. Antya 2.87]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya prepared varieties of rice and vegetables at home and brought the Lord there alone to eat.

  ; [[.2:88|Cc. Antya 2.88]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya's father, whose name was Śatānanda Khān, was an expert statesman, whereas Bhagavān Ācārya was not at all interested in the management of the state. Indeed, he was almost in the renounced order of life.

  ; [[.2:89|Cc. Antya 2.89]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya's brother, whose name was Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya, had studied Vedānta philosophy at Benares and had then returned to Bhagavān Ācārya's home.

  ; [[.2:90|Cc. Antya 2.90]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya took his brother to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but the Lord, knowing that Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya was a Māyāvādī philosopher, could not get much happiness from meeting him.

  ; [[.2:91|Cc. Antya 2.91]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu derives no happiness from meeting one who is not a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Thus because Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya was a Māyāvādī scholar, the Lord felt no jubilation in meeting him. Nevertheless, because Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya was related to Bhagavān Ācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu feigned pleasure in seeing him.

  ; [[.2:92|Cc. Antya 2.92]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya said to Svarūpa Dāmodara, "Gopāla, my younger brother, has returned to my home, having concluded his study of Vedānta philosophy."

  ; [[.2:93|Cc. Antya 2.93]]
  : Bhagavān Ācārya requested Svarūpa Dāmodara to hear from Gopāla the commentary upon Vedānta. Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, however, somewhat angry because of love, spoke as follows.

  ; [[.2:94|Cc. Antya 2.94]]
  : "You have lost your intelligence in the association of Gopāla, and therefore you are eager to hear the Māyāvāda philosophy.

  ; [[.2:95|Cc. Antya 2.95]]
  : "When a Vaiṣṇava listens to the Śārīraka-bhāṣya, the Māyāvāda commentary upon Vedānta-sūtra, he gives up the Kṛṣṇa conscious attitude that the Lord is the master and the living entity is His servant. Instead, he considers himself the Supreme Lord.

  ; [[.2:96|Cc. Antya 2.96]]
  : "The Māyāvāda philosophy presents such a jugglery of words that even a highly elevated devotee who has accepted Kṛṣṇa as his life and soul changes his decision when he reads the Māyāvāda commentary on Vedānta-sūtra."

  ; [[.2:97|Cc. Antya 2.97]]
  : In spite of Svarūpa Dāmodara's protest, Bhagavān Ācārya continued, "We are all fixed at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa with our hearts and souls. Therefore the Śārīraka-bhāṣya cannot change our minds."

  ; [[.2:98|Cc. Antya 2.98]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara replied, "Nevertheless, when we hear the Māyāvāda philosophy, we hear that Brahman is knowledge and that the universe of māyā is false, but we gain no spiritual understanding.

  ; [[.2:99|Cc. Antya 2.99]]
  : "The Māyāvādī philosopher tries to establish that the living entity is only imaginary and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is under the influence of māyā. Hearing this kind of commentary breaks the heart and life of a devotee."

  ; [[.2:100|Cc. Antya 2.100]]
  : Thus Bhagavān Ācārya, greatly ashamed and fearful, remained silent. The next day, he asked Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya to return to his own district.

  ; [[.2:101|Cc. Antya 2.101]]
  : One day Bhagavān Ācārya invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to dine at his home. Thus he was preparing rice and various types of vegetables.

  ; [[.2:102|Cc. Antya 2.102]]
  : A devotee named Choṭa Haridāsa used to sing for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Bhagavān Ācārya called him to his home and spoke as follows.

  ; [[.2:103|Cc. Antya 2.103]]
  : "Please go to the sister of Śikhi Māhiti. In my name, ask her for a māna of white rice and bring it here."

  ; [[.2:104|Cc. Antya 2.104]]
  : Śikhi Māhiti's sister was named Mādhavīdevī. She was an elderly lady who always performed austerities. She was very advanced in devotional service.

  ; [[.2:105|Cc. Antya 2.105]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted her as having formerly been an associate of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. In the entire world, three and a half people were His intimate devotees.

  ; [[.2:106|Cc. Antya 2.106]]
  : The three were Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Rāmānanda Rāya and Śikhi Māhiti, and the half a person was Śikhi Māhiti's sister.

  ; [[.2:107|Cc. Antya 2.107]]
  : After begging the rice from her, Junior Haridāsa brought it to Bhagavān Ācārya, who was very pleased to see its quality.

  ; [[.2:108|Cc. Antya 2.108]]
  : In great affection, Bhagavān Ācārya cooked varieties of vegetables and other preparations dear to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He also obtained remnants of food from Lord Jagannātha and digestive aids such as ground ginger and also lime with salt.

  ; [[.2:109|Cc. Antya 2.109]]
  : At noon, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to eat the offerings of Bhagavān Ācārya, He first appreciated the fine rice and therefore questioned him.

  ; [[.2:110|Cc. Antya 2.110]]
  : "Where did you get such fine rice?" the Lord asked. Bhagavān Ācārya replied, "I got it by begging from Mādhavīdevī."

  ; [[.2:111|Cc. Antya 2.111]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked who had begged the rice and brought it back, Bhagavān Ācārya mentioned the name of Junior Haridāsa.

  ; [[.2:112|Cc. Antya 2.112]]
  : Praising the quality of the rice, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu partook of the prasāda. Then, after returning to His residence, He gave the following order to Govinda, His personal assistant.

  ; [[.2:113|Cc. Antya 2.113]]
  : " From this day forward, do not allow Choṭa Haridāsa to come here."

  ; [[.2:114|Cc. Antya 2.114]]
  : When Junior Haridāsa heard that he had been ordered not to approach Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy. No one could understand why he had been ordered not to come.

  ; [[.2:115|Cc. Antya 2.115]]
  : Haridāsa fasted continuously for three days. Then Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and other confidential devotees approached Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to inquire from Him.

  ; [[.2:116|Cc. Antya 2.116]]
  : "What great offense has Junior Haridāsa committed? Why has he been forbidden to come to Your door? He has now been fasting for three days."

  ; [[.2:117|Cc. Antya 2.117]]
  : The Lord replied, "I cannot tolerate seeing the face of a person who has accepted the renounced order of life but who still talks intimately with a woman.

  ; [[.2:118|Cc. Antya 2.118]]
  : "So strongly do the senses adhere to the objects of their enjoyment that indeed a wooden statue of a woman attracts the mind of even a great saintly person.

  ; [[.2:119|Cc. Antya 2.119]]
  : " 'One should not sit closely with one's mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that they may attract even a person advanced in knowledge.'

  ; [[.2:120|Cc. Antya 2.120]]
  : "There are many persons with little in their possession who accept the renounced order of life like monkeys. They go here and there engaging in sense gratification and speaking intimately with women."

  ; [[.2:121|Cc. Antya 2.121]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered His room. Seeing Him in such an angry mood, all the devotees fell silent.

  ; [[.2:122|Cc. Antya 2.122]]
  : The next day, all the devotees together approached the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to submit an appeal on behalf of Junior Haridāsa.

  ; [[.2:123|Cc. Antya 2.123]]
  : "Haridāsa has committed a small offense," they said. "Therefore, O Lord, please be merciful to him. Now he has received a sufficient lesson. In the future he will not commit such a offense."

  ; [[.2:124|Cc. Antya 2.124]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My mind is not under My control. It does not like to see anyone in the renounced order who talks intimately with women.

  ; [[.2:125|Cc. Antya 2.125]]
  : "You should all tend to your respective engagements. Give up this useless talk. If you speak this way again, I shall go away, and you will no longer see Me here."

  ; [[.2:126|Cc. Antya 2.126]]
  : Hearing this, all the devotees covered their ears with their hands, got up and went about their respective duties.

  ; [[.2:127|Cc. Antya 2.127]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also left that place to perform His noon duties. No one could understand His pastimes.

  ; [[.2:128|Cc. Antya 2.128]]
  : The next day, all the devotees went to Śrī Paramānanda Purī and requested him to pacify the Lord.

  ; [[.2:129|Cc. Antya 2.129]]
  : Paramānanda Purī thereupon went alone to the residence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord, after offering him obeisances, seated him by His side with great respect.

  ; [[.2:130|Cc. Antya 2.130]]
  : The Lord inquired, "What is your order? For what purpose have you come here?" Paramānanda Purī then submitted his prayer that the Lord show favor to Junior Haridāsa.

  ; [[.2:131|Cc. Antya 2.131]]
  : Hearing this request, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "My dear lord, please hear me. It is better for you to stay here with all the Vaiṣṇavas.

  ; [[.2:132|Cc. Antya 2.132]]
  : "Please give Me permission to go to Ālālanātha. I shall remain there alone; only Govinda will go with Me."

  ; [[.2:133|Cc. Antya 2.133]]
  : After saying this, the Lord called for Govinda. Offering obeisances to Paramānanda Purī, He got up and began to leave.

  ; [[.2:134|Cc. Antya 2.134]]
  : In great haste Paramānanda Purī Gosāñi went before Him and with great humility persuaded Him to sit down in His own room.

  ; [[.2:135|Cc. Antya 2.135]]
  : Paramānanda Purī said, "My dear Lord Caitanya, You are the independent Personality of Godhead. You can do whatever You like. Who can say anything above You?

  ; [[.2:136|Cc. Antya 2.136]]
  : "All Your activities are for the benefit of people in general. We cannot understand them, for Your intentions are deep and grave."

  ; [[.2:137|Cc. Antya 2.137]]
  : After saying this, Paramānanda Purī Gosāñi left for his own home. Then all the devotees went to see Junior Haridāsa.

  ; [[.2:138|Cc. Antya 2.138]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosāñi said, "Please hear us, Haridāsa, for we all wish you well. Please believe this.

  ; [[.2:139|Cc. Antya 2.139]]
  : "At present Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is persisting in His mood of anger because He is the independent Supreme Personality of Godhead. At some time, however, He will surely be merciful, for at heart He is very kind.

  ; [[.2:140|Cc. Antya 2.140]]
  : "The Lord is persisting, and if you also persist, His persistence will increase. It is better for you to bathe and take prasāda. In due course, His anger will automatically subside."

  ; [[.2:141|Cc. Antya 2.141]]
  : Having said this, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī induced Haridāsa to bathe and take prasāda. After thus reassuring him, he returned home.

  ; [[.2:142|Cc. Antya 2.142]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to see Lord Jagannātha in the temple, Haridāsa would stay a long distance away and see Him.

  ; [[.2:143|Cc. Antya 2.143]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the ocean of mercy. Who can understand Him? When He chastises His dear devotees, He certainly does so to reestablish the principles of religion or duty.

  ; [[.2:144|Cc. Antya 2.144]]
  : After all the devotees saw this example, a mentality of fear grew among them. Therefore they all stopped talking with women, even in dreams.

  ; [[.2:145|Cc. Antya 2.145]]
  : In this way a complete year passed for Junior Haridāsa, but still there was not a sign of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy toward him.

  ; [[.2:146|Cc. Antya 2.146]]
  : Thus at the end of one night, Junior Haridāsa, after offering Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu his respectful obeisances, departed for Prayāga without saying anything to anyone.

  ; [[.2:147|Cc. Antya 2.147]]
  : Junior Haridāsa had conclusively decided to attain shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus he entered deep into the water at Triveṇī, the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā at Prayāga, and in this way gave up his life.

  ; [[.2:148|Cc. Antya 2.148]]
  : Immediately after committing suicide in this way, he went in his spiritual body to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and received the mercy of the Lord. However, he still remained invisible.

  ; [[.2:149|Cc. Antya 2.149]]
  : In a spiritual body resembling that of a Gandharva, Junior Haridāsa, although invisible, would sing at night for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to hear. No one but the Lord, however, knew of this.

  ; [[.2:150|Cc. Antya 2.150]]
  : One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired from the devotees, "Where is Haridāsa? Now you may bring him here."

  ; [[.2:151|Cc. Antya 2.151]]
  : The devotees all replied, "One night at the end of a full year, Junior Haridāsa got up and went away. No one knows where he has gone."

  ; [[.2:152|Cc. Antya 2.152]]
  : While hearing the devotees lament, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was mildly smiling. Thus all the devotees were very astonished.

  ; [[.2:153-154|Cc. Antya 2.153-154]]
  : One day Jagadānanda, Svarūpa, Govinda, Kāśīśvara, Śaṅkara, Dāmodara and Mukunda all went to bathe in the sea. They could hear Haridāsa singing from a distant place as if calling them in his original voice.

  ; [[.2:155|Cc. Antya 2.155]]
  : No one could see him, but they could hear him singing in a sweet voice. Therefore all the devotees, headed by Govinda, made this guess.

  ; [[.2:156|Cc. Antya 2.156]]
  : "Haridāsa must have committed suicide by drinking poison, and because of this sinful act, he has now become a brāhmaṇa ghost.

  ; [[.2:157|Cc. Antya 2.157]]
  : "We cannot see his material form," they said, "but still we hear his sweet singing. Therefore he must have become a ghost." Svarūpa Dāmodara, however, protested, "This is a false guess.

  ; [[.2:158|Cc. Antya 2.158]]
  : "Junior Haridāsa chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra throughout his entire life and served the Supreme Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Moreover, he is dear to the Lord and has died in a holy place.

  ; [[.2:159|Cc. Antya 2.159]]
  : "Haridāsa cannot have been degraded; he must have attained liberation. This is a pastime of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. You will all understand it later."

  ; [[.2:160|Cc. Antya 2.160]]
  : A devotee returned to Navadvīpa from Prayāga and told everyone the details of Junior Haridāsa's suicide.

  ; [[.2:161|Cc. Antya 2.161]]
  : He explained how Junior Haridāsa had made his resolution and had thus entered the waters at the confluence of the Yamunā and Ganges. Hearing these details, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura and the other devotees were very surprised.

  ; [[.2:162|Cc. Antya 2.162]]
  : At the end of the year, Śivānanda Sena came to Jagannātha Purī as usual, accompanied by the other devotees, and thus in great happiness met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:163|Cc. Antya 2.163]]
  : When Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura inquired from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Where is Junior Haridāsa?" The Lord replied, "A person is sure to achieve the results of his fruitive activities."

  ; [[.2:164|Cc. Antya 2.164]]
  : Then Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura related the details of Haridāsa's decision and his entering the waters at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamunā.

  ; [[.2:165|Cc. Antya 2.165]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard these details, He smiled in a pleased mood and said, "If with sensual intentions one looks at women, this is the only process of atonement."

  ; [[.2:166|Cc. Antya 2.166]]
  : Then all the devotees, headed by Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, concluded that because Haridāsa had committed suicide at the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamunā, he must have ultimately attained shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.2:167|Cc. Antya 2.167]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of mother Śacī, performs His pastimes, which greatly satisfy the ears and minds of pure devotees who hear about them.

  ; [[.2:168|Cc. Antya 2.168]]
  : This incident manifests the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His teaching that a sannyāsī should remain in the renounced order, and the deep attachment to Him felt by His faithful devotees.

  ; [[.2:169|Cc. Antya 2.169]]
  : It also demonstrates the glories of holy places and shows how the Lord accepts His faithful devotee. Thus the Lord fulfilled five or seven purposes by performing one pastime.

  ; [[.2:170|Cc. Antya 2.170]]
  : The pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are like nectar, and they are deep like the ocean. People in general cannot understand them, but a sober devotee can.

  ; [[.2:171|Cc. Antya 2.171]]
  : Please hear the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with faith and confidence. Do not argue, for arguments will produce a contrary result.

  ; [[.2:172|Cc. Antya 2.172]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
