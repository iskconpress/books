**Saying this, he offered prayers to the mahā-prasāda, took a little portion, and ate it.**

===== Purport =====

//Mahā-prasāda// is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, instead of eating //mahā-prasāda,// one should honor it. It is said here, //karilā vandana,// "he offered prayers." When taking //mahā-prasāda,// one should not consider the food ordinary preparations. //Prasāda// means favor. One should consider //mahā-prasāda// a favor of Kṛṣṇa. As stated by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, //kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya karibāre jihvā jaya svaprasāda-anna dilā bhāi. Kṛṣṇa// is very kind. In this material world we are all very attached to tasting various types of food. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa eats many nice varieties of food and offers the food back to the devotees, so that not only are one's demands for various tastes satisfied, but by eating //prasāda// he makes advancement in spiritual life. Therefore, we should never consider ordinary food on an equal level with //mahā-prasāda.//
