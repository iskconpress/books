Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, in his //Anubhāṣya,// quotes from the //Viṣṇu-smṛti// in reference to //śrāddha-pātra.//

> brāhmaṇāpasadā hy ete
> kathitāḥ paṅkti-dūṣakāḥ
> etān vivarjayed yatnāt
> śrāddha-karmaṇi paṇḍitaḥ

According to this verse, if one is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family but does not behave according to brahminical standards, he should not be offered the //śrāddha-pātra,// which is //prasāda// offered to the forefathers. Advaita Ācārya offered the //śrāddha-pātra// to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, not to a //brāhmaṇa// who had been born in a //brāhmaṇa// family. Although Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in the family of meateaters, because he was an advanced devotee he was shown more respect than a first-class //brāhmaṇa.//
