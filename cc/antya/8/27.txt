===== Purport =====

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has explained in his //Anubhāṣya// that the word //nirbandha// indicates that Rāmacandra Purī had a steady desire to criticize others. Impersonalist Māyāvādīs who have no relationship with Kṛṣṇa, who cannot take to devotional service and who simply engage in material arguments to understand Brahman regard devotional service to Kṛṣṇa as //karma-kāṇḍa,// or fruitive activities. According to them, devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is but another means for attaining //dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa.// Therefore they criticize the devotees for engaging in material activities. They think that devotional service is //māyā// and that Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu is also //māyā.// Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Such a mentality awakens in a person who is an offender to Kṛṣṇa and His devotees.
