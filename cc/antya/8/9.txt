===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered obeisances to Rāmacandra Purī in consideration of his being a disciple of Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī, the spiritual master of His own spiritual master, Īśvara Purī. When a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// meets another Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī,// they both remember Kṛṣṇa. Even Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// generally remember Nārāyaṇa, who is also Kṛṣṇa, by saying //oṁ namo bhagavate nārāyaṇa// or //namo nārāyaṇa.// Thus it is the duty of a //sannyāsī// to remember Kṛṣṇa. According to //smṛti-śāstra,// a //sannyāsī// does not offer obeisances or blessings to anyone. it is said, //sannyāsī nirāśīr nirnamaṣkriyaḥ:// a //sannyāsī// should not offer anyone blessings or obeisances.
