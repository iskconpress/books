Because Rāmacandra Purī was a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī, both Paramānanda Purī and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered him respectful obeisances. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that although Rāmacandra Purī was naturally very envious and although he was against the principles of Vaiṣṇavism-or, in other words, against the principles of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees-common people nevertheless addressed him as //Gosvāmī// or //Gosāñi// because he was superficially in the renounced order and dressed like a //sannyāsī.// In the modern age the title //gosvāmī// is used by a caste of //gṛhasthas,// but formerly it was not. Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, for example, were called //gosvāmī// because they were in the renounced order. Similarly, because Paramānanda Purī was a //sannyāsī,// he was called Purī Gosvāmī. By careful scrutiny, therefore, one will find that gosvāmī is not the title for a certain caste; rather, it is properly the title for a person in the renounced order.
