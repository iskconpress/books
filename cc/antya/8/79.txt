**"Of the two rules, Rāmacandra Purī obeys the first by abandoning praise, but although he knows that the second is more prominent, he neglects it by criticizing others.**

===== Purport =====

The above-mentioned verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// gives two injunctions. The first, called //pūrva-vidhi,// is that one should not praise, and the second, //para-vidhi,// is that one should not criticize. As will be apparent from the following verse, the injunction against praise is less important than the injunction against blasphemy. One should carefully observe the //para-vidhi,// although one may neglect the //pūrva-vidhi.// Thus the actual injunction is that one may praise but should not criticize. This is called //śleṣokti,// or a statement having two meanings. Rāmacandra Purī, however, acted in just the opposite way, for he neglected the //para-vidhi// but strictly observed the //pūrva-vidhi.// Since he avoided following the principle of not criticizing, Rāmacandra Purī broke both the rules.
