===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā:// a Brahman realized person is always happy. //Na śocati na kāṅkṣati:// he neither laments nor aspires for anything. Not knowing why Mādhavendra Purī was crying, Rāmacandra Purī tried to become his advisor. Thus he committed a great offense, for a disciple should never try to instruct his spiritual master.
