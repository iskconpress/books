===== Purport =====

Generally those who invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for dinner used to offer Him the remnants of food that had first been offered to Lord Jagannātha. Bhagavān Ācārya, however, instead of giving Him the remnants of Jagannātha's food, prepared dinner at his home. In Orissa, food offered to Lord Jagannātha is called //prasādī,// and that which is not offered to Lord Jagannātha is known as //āmānī// or //ghara-bhāta,// rice prepared at home.
