As stated in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:antya:7:11|(Antya 7.11)]]:

Unless one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one cannot spread the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// throughout the world. Persons who do so are empowered. Therefore they are sometimes called //āveśa-avatāras// or incarnations, for they are endowed with the power of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
