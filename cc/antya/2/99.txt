Śrīla Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī wanted to impress upon Bhagavān Ācārya that even though someone firmly fixed in devotion to Kṛṣṇa's service might not be deviated by hearing the Māyāvāda //bhāṣya,// that //bhāṣya// is nevertheless full of impersonal words and ideas such as Brahman which represent knowledge but which are impersonal. The Māyāvādīs say that the world created by //māyā// is false, and that actually there is no living entity but only one spiritual effulgence. They further say that God is imaginary, that people think of God only because of ignorance, and that when the Supreme Absolute Truth is befooled by the external energy, //māyā,// He becomes a //jīva,// or living entity. Upon hearing all these nonsensical ideas from the nondevotee, a devotee is greatly afflicted, as if his heart and soul were broken.
