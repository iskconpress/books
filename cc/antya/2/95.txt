**"When a Vaiṣṇava listens to the Śārīraka-bhāṣya, the Māyāvāda commentary upon Vedānta-sūtra, he gives up the Kṛṣṇa conscious attitude that the Lord is the master and the living entity is His servant. Instead, he considers himself the Supreme Lord.**

===== Purport =====

The philosophers known as //kevalādvaita-vādīs// generally occupy themselves with hearing the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya,// a commentary by Śaṅkarācārya advocating that one impersonally consider oneself the Supreme Lord. Such Māyāvāda philosophical commentaries upon Vedānta are simply imaginary, but there are other commentaries on Vedānta philosophy. The commentary by Śrīla Rāmānujācārya, known as //Śrī-bhāṣya,// establishes the //viśiṣṭādvaita-vāda// philosophy. Similarly, in the Brahma-sampradāya, Madhvācārya's //Pūrṇaprajña-bhāṣya// establishes //śuddha-dvaita-vāda.// In the Kumāra-sampradāya, or Nimbārka-sampradāya, Śrī Nimbārka establishes the philosophy of //dvaitādvaita-vāda// in the //Pārijāta-saurabha-bhāṣya.// And in the Viṣṇusvāmi-sampradāya, or Rudra-sampradāya, which comes from Lord Śiva, Viṣṇusvāmī has written a commentary called //Sarvajña-bhāṣya,// which establishes //śuddhādvaita-vāda.//

A Vaiṣṇava should study the commentaries on //Vedānta-sūtra// written by the four //sampradāya-ācāryas,// namely Śrī Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇusvāmī and Nimbārka, for these commentaries are based upon the philosophy that the Lord is the master and that all living entities are His eternal servants. One interested in studying Vedānta philosophy properly must study these commentaries, especially if he is a Vaiṣṇava. These commentaries are always adored by Vaiṣṇavas. The commentary by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī is elaborately given in the //Ādi-līlā,// Chapter Seven, text 101. The Māyāvāda commentary //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// is like poison for a Vaiṣṇava. It should not be touched at all. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura remarks that even a //mahā-bhāgavata,// or highly elevated devotee who has surrendered himself unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, sometimes falls down from pure devotional service if he hears the Māyāvāda philosophy of //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// This commentary should therefore be shunned by all Vaiṣṇavas.
