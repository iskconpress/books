===== Purport =====

In connection with //strī-sambhāṣaṇa,// talking with women, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that talking with women for the purpose of mingling with them for sense gratification, subtle or gross, is strictly prohibited. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, the great moral instructor, says, //mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.// Thus not only a person in the renounced order or one engaged in devotional service but everyone should avoid mingling with women. One should consider another's wife his mother.
