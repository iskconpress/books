**Bhagavān Ācārya's brother, whose name was Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya, had studied Vedānta philosophy at Benares and had then returned to Bhagavān Ācārya's home.**

===== Purport =====

During those days and also at the present, Vedānta philosophy is understood through the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, which is known as //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// Thus it appears that Gopāla Bhaṭṭācārya the younger brother of Bhagavān Ācārya, had studied Vedānta according to the way of the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya,// which expounds the Māyāvāda philosophy of the impersonalists.
