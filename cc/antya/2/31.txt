Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains the Gaura-gopāla //mantra// in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// Worshipers of Śrī Gaurasundara accept the four syllables //gau-ra-aṇ-ga// as the Gaura //mantra,// but pure worshipers of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa accept the four syllables //rā-dhā kṛṣ-ṇa// as the Gaura-gopāla //mantra.// However, Vaiṣṇavas consider Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu nondifferent from Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa (//śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya//). Therefore one who chants the //mantra// Gaurāṅga and one who chants the names of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are on the same level.
