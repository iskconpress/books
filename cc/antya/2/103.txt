In India //śukla-cāula// (white rice) is also called //ātapa-cāula,// or rice that has not been boiled before being threshed. Another kind of rice, called //siddha-cāula// (brown rice), is boiled before being threshed. Generally, first-class fine white rice is required for offerings to the Deity. Thus Bhagavān Ācārya asked Choṭa Haridāsa, or Junior Haridāsa, a singer in the assembly of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to get some of this rice from the sister of Śikhi Māhiti. A //māna// is a standard of measurement in Orissa for rice and other food grains.
