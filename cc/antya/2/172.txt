**Instructions from this Chapter**

Summarizing this chapter, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that one should derive from it the following lessons. (1) Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is an incarnation of mercy, He nevertheless gave up the company of one of His personal associates, namely Junior Haridāsa, for if He had not done so, pseudo-devotees would have taken advantage of Junior Haridāsa's fault by using it as an excuse to live as devotees and at the same time have illicit sexual connections. Such activities would have demoralized the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and as a result, devotees would surely have gone to a hellish life in the name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. (2) By chastising Junior Haridāsa, the Lord set the standard for //ācāryas,// or the heads of institutions propagating the Caitanya cult, and for all actual devotees. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to maintain the highest standard. (3) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed that a pure devotee should be simple and free from sinful activities, for thus one can be His bona fide servant. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His followers how to observe the renounced order strictly. (4) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to prove that His devotees are exalted and that their character is ideal. He kindly accepts His faithful devotees and teaches them how much tribulation and disturbance can be produced by even a slight deviation from the strict principles of devotional life. (5) By chastising Junior Haridāsa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His mercy toward him, thus showing how elevated was junior Haridāsa's devotion for Him. Because of this transcendental relationship, the Lord corrected even a slight offense committed by His pure devotee. Therefore one who wants to be a pure devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should give up all material sense gratification; otherwise, the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are very difficult to attain. (6) If one dies in such a celebrated holy place as Prayāga, Mathurā or Vṛndāvana, one can be relieved of the reactions to sinful life and then attain the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (7) Although a pure or faithful devotee may fall down, he nevertheless ultimately gets the chance to go back home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Antya-līlā,  Second Chapter, describing the chastisement of Junior Haridāsa.//
