{{description>"The blue lotuses are friends of the sun-god, and though they all live together, the blue lotuses plunder the cakravākas. The red lotuses, however, blossom at night and are therefore strangers or enemies to the cakravākas. Yet in Kṛṣṇa's pastimes the red lotuses, which are the hands of the gopīs, protect their cakravāka breasts. This is a metaphor of contradiction."}}

Because the blue lotus flower blossoms with the rising of the sun, the sun is the friend of the blue lotus. The //cakravāka// birds also appear when the sun rises, and therefore the //cakravākas// and blue lotuses meet. Although the blue lotus is a friend of the sun, in Kṛṣṇa's pastimes it nevertheless plunders their mutual friend the //cakravāka.// Normally, //cakravākas// move about whereas lotuses stand still, but herein Kṛṣṇa's hands, which are compared to blue lotuses, attack the breasts of the //gopīs,// which are compared to //cakravākas.// This is called a reverse analogy. At night the red lotus blossoms, whereas in sunlight it closes. Therefore the red lotus is an enemy to the sun and is unknown to the sun's friend the //cakravāka.// The //gopīs'// breasts, however, are compared to //cakravākas// and their hands to red lotuses protecting them. This is a wonderful instance of reverse analogy.
