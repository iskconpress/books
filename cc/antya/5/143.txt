===== Purport =====

In this verse also, mother Sarasvatī offers prayers to Kṛṣṇa. The word //puruṣa-adhama// refers to the Personality of Godhead, under whom all other persons remain, or, in other words, //puruṣa-uttama,// the best of all living beings. Similarly, the word //bandhu-han// means "the killer of māyā." In the conditioned state of life, one is closely related with //māyā// as a friend, but when one comes in contact with Kṛṣṇa one is freed from that relationship.
