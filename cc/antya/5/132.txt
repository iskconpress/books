It is clearly to be understood in this connection that the followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's way of devotional service are eternally associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and perfect knowers of the Absolute Truth. If one immediately follows the principles of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by associating with His devotees, lusty desires for material enjoyment will vanish from one's heart. Then one will be able to understand the meaning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and the purpose of listening to it. Otherwise such understanding is impossible.
