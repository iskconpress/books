**"When one hears or describes with great faith the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, such as His rāsa dance with the gopīs, the disease of lusty desires in his heart and the agitation caused by the three modes of material nature are immediately nullified, and he becomes sober and silent.**

===== Purport =====

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments in this connection, "Any person seriously inclined to hear about the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa// dance, as mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// with great faith and a transcendental, spiritually inspired mind, is immediately freed from the natural lusty desires found within the heart of a materialistic man."

When a pure Vaiṣṇava speaks on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and another pure Vaiṣṇava hears //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from such a realized soul, both of them live in the transcendental world, where the contamination of the modes of material nature cannot touch them. Freed from the contamination of the modes of nature, the speaker and hearer are fixed in a transcendental mentality, knowing that their position on the transcendental platform is to serve the Supreme Lord. The class known as //prākṛta-sahajiyā,// who consider the transcendental pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa something like the behavior between a man and a woman in the material field, artificially think that hearing the //rāsa-līlā// will help them by diminishing the lusty desires of their diseased hearts. But because they do not follow the regulative principles but instead violate even ordinary morals, their contemplation of //rāsa-līlā// is a futile attempt, which sometimes results in their imitating the dealings of the //gopīs// and Lord Kṛṣṇa. To forbid such habits of the //prākṛta-sahajiyās,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has excluded their material intelligence by using the word //viśvāsa// ("faith"). In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.33.30), Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī says:

> naitat samācarej jātu
> manasāpi hy anīśvaraḥ
> vinaśyaty ācaran mauḍhyād
> yathā rudro 'bdhijaṁ viṣam

"Certainly one who is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead should never, even within his mind, imitate the activities of the transcendental //rāsa-līlā// of Kṛṣṇa. If out of ignorance one does so, he will be destroyed, just as if he were to imitate Lord Śiva, who drank poison produced from the ocean."
