A mellow temporarily appearing transcendental but contradicting mellows previously stated and lacking some of a mellow's necessities is called //rasābhāsa,// an overlapping mellow, by advanced devotees who know how to taste transcendental mellows. Such mellows are called //uparasa// (submellows), //anurasa// (imitation transcendental mellows) and //aparasa// (opposing transcendental mellows). Thus the overlapping of transcendental mellows is described as being first //grade,// second grade or third grade. When the twelve mellows-such as neutrality, servitorship and friendship-are characterized by adverse //sthāyi-bhāva, vibhāva// and //anubhāva// ecstasies, they are known as //uparasa,// submellows. When the seven indirect transcendental mellows and the dried up mellow of neutrality are produced by devotees and moods not directly related to Kṛṣṇa and devotional service in ecstatic love, they are described as //anurasa,// imitation mellows. If Kṛṣṇa and the enemies who harbor feelings of opposition toward Him are respectively the object and abodes of the mellow of laughter, the resulting feelings are called //aparasa,// opposing mellows. Experts in distinguishing one mellow from another sometimes accept some overlapping transcendental mellows (rasābhāsa) as //rasas// due to their being pleasurable and tasteful. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, //paraspara-vairayor yadi yogas tadā rasābhāsaḥ:// "When two opposing transcendental mellows overlap, they produce //rasābhāsa,// or an overlapping of transcendental mellows."
