When a man is greatly learned in the //Vedānta-sūtras,// he is known as //paṇḍita,// or a learned scholar. Generally this qualifications attributed to //brāhmaṇas// and //sannyāsīs. Sannyāsa,// the renounced order of life, is the topmost position for a //brāhmaṇa,// a member of the highest of the four //varṇas// (//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra).// According to public opinion, a person born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, duly reformed by the purificatory processes and properly initiated by a spiritual master, is an authority on Vedic literature. When such a person is offered the //sannyāsa// order, he comes to occupy the topmost position. The //brāhmaṇa// is supposed to be the spiritual master of the other three //varṇas,// namely //kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra,// and the //sannyāsī// is supposed to be the spiritual master even of the exalted //brāhmaṇas.//

Generally //brāhmaṇas// and //sannyāsīs// are very proud of their spiritual positions. Therefore, to cut down their false pride, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness through Rāmānanda Rāya, who was neither a member of the renounced order nor a born //brāhmaṇa.// indeed, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was a //gṛhastha// belonging to the //śūdra// class, yet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arranged for him to be the master who taught Pradyumna Miśra, a highly qualified //brāhmaṇa// born in a //brāhmaṇa// family. Even Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, although belonging to the renounced order, took instruction from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His opulence through Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya. That is the special significance of this incident.

According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, //yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru' haya:// anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa can become a spiritual master, without reference to whether or not he is a //brāhmaṇa// or //sannyāsī.// Ordinary people cannot understand the essence of śāstra, nor can they understand the pure character, behavior and abilities of strict followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's principles. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is creating pure, exalted Vaiṣṇavas even from those born in families considered lower than those of //śūdras.// This is proof that a Vaiṣṇava may appear in any family, as confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ

"Kirāta, Hūṇa, Āndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana and the //Khasa// races, and even others addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." [[books:sb:2:4:18|(Bhāg. 2.4.18)]] By the grace of the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, one can be completely purified, become a preacher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and become the spiritual master of the entire world. This principle is accepted in all Vedic literature. Evidence can be quoted from authoritative //śāstras// showing how a lowborn person can become the spiritual master of the entire world. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is to be considered the most munificent personality, for He distributes the real essence of Vedic //śāstras// to anyone who becomes qualified by becoming His sincere servant.
