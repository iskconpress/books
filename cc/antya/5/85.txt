**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached about devotional service, ecstatic love and the Absolute Truth by making Rāmānanda Rāya, a gṛhastha born in a low family, the speaker. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, the exalted brāhmaṇa-sannyāsī, and Pradyumna Miśra, the purified brāhmaṇa, both became the hearers of Rāmānanda Rāya.**

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya// that //sannyāsīs// in the line of Śaṅkarācārya always think that they have performed all the duties of //brāhmaṇas// and that, furthermore, having understood the essence of //Vedānta-sūtra// and become //sannyāsīs,// they are the natural spiritual masters of all society. Similarly, persons born in brāhmaṇa families think that because they execute the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the //Vedas// and follow the principles of //smṛti,// they alone can become spiritual masters of society. These highly exalted //brāhmaṇas// think that unless one is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, one cannot become a spiritual master and teach the Absolute Truth. To cut down the pride of these birthright //brāhmaṇas// and Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proved that a person like Rāmānanda Rāya, although born in a //śūdra// family and situated in the //gṛhastha-āśrama,// can become the spiritual master of such exalted personalities as Himself and Pradyumna Miśra. This is the principle of the Vaiṣṇava cult, as evinced in the teachings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A person who knows what is spiritual and what is material and who is firmly fixed in the spiritual position can be //jagad-guru,// the spiritual master of the entire world. One cannot become //jagad-guru// simply by advertising oneself as //jagad-guru// without knowing the essential principles for becoming //jagad-guru.// Even people who never see what a //jagad-guru// is and never talk with other people become puffed-up //sannyāsīs// and declare themselves //jagad-gurus.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like this. Any person who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa and who is fully qualified in spiritual life can become //jagad-guru.// Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally took lessons from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and also sent Pradyumna Miśra, an exalted //brāhmaṇa,// to take lessons from him.
