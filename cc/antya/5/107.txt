===== Purport =====

//Grāmya-kavi// refers to a poet or writer such as the authors of novels and other fiction who write only about the relationships between man and woman. //Vidagdha-ātmīya-vākya,// however, refers to words written by a devotee who fully understands pure devotional service. Such devotees, who follow the //paramparā// system, are sometimes described as //sajātīyāśaya-snigdha,// or "pleasing to the same class of people." Only the poetry and other writings of such devotees are accepted with great happiness by devotees.
