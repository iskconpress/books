====== Pastimes with Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī ======

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the Thirteenth Chapter in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// Thinking Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be uncomfortable sleeping on bark of plantain trees, Jagadānanda made a pillow and quilt for Him. The Lord, however, did not accept them. Then Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī made another pillow and quilt from finely shredded plantain leaves, and after strongly objecting, the Lord accepted them. With the permission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita went to Vṛndāvana, where he discussed many devotional subjects with Sanātana Gosvāmī. There was also a discussion about Mukunda Sarasvatī's garment. When Jagadānanda returned to Jagannātha Purī, he presented Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu some gifts from Sanātana Gosvāmī, and the incident of the //pīlu// fruit took place.

Once, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became ecstatic upon hearing the songs of a //deva-dāsī.// Unaware of who was singing, He ran toward her through thorny bushes, but when Govinda informed the Lord that it was a woman singing, He immediately stopped. By this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed everyone that //sannyāsīs// and Vaiṣṇavas should not hear women singing.

When Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī left Vārāṇasī on his way to Jagannātha Purī after completing his education, he met Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa Paṇḍita. Viśvāsa Paṇḍita was very proud of his education, and being an impersonalist, he was not well received by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. A partial study of the life of Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī comprises the end of this chapter.

  ; [[.13:1|Cc. Antya 13.1]]
  : Let me take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Gauracandra. His mind became exhausted and His body very thin from the pain of separation from Kṛṣṇa, but when He felt ecstatic love for the Lord, He again became fully developed.

  ; [[.13:2|Cc. Antya 13.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to the devotees of the Lord!

  ; [[.13:3|Cc. Antya 13.3]]
  : In the company of Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would taste various transcendental relationships of pure love.

  ; [[.13:4|Cc. Antya 13.4]]
  : The unhappiness of separation from Kṛṣṇa exhausted the Lord's mind and reduced the structure of His body, but when He felt emotions of ecstatic love, He again became developed and healthy.

  ; [[.13:5|Cc. Antya 13.5]]
  : Because He was very thin, when He lay down to rest on the dry bark of plantain trees, it caused Him pain in His bones.

  ; [[.13:6|Cc. Antya 13.6]]
  : All the devotees felt very unhappy to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in pain. Indeed, they could not tolerate it. Then Jagadānanda Paṇḍita devised a remedy.

  ; [[.13:7|Cc. Antya 13.7]]
  : He acquired some fine cloth and colored it with red oxide. Then he filled it with cotton from a śimula tree.

  ; [[.13:8|Cc. Antya 13.8]]
  : In this way he made a quilt and a pillow, which he then gave to Govinda, saying, "Ask the Lord to lie on this."

  ; [[.13:9|Cc. Antya 13.9]]
  : Jagadānanda said to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, "Today please personally persuade Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to lie down on the bed."

  ; [[.13:10|Cc. Antya 13.10]]
  : When it was time for the Lord to go to bed, Svarūpa Dāmodara stayed nearby, but when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the quilt and pillow, He was immediately very angry.

  ; [[.13:11|Cc. Antya 13.11]]
  : The Lord inquired from Govinda, "Who has made this?" When Govinda named Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was somewhat fearful.

  ; [[.13:12|Cc. Antya 13.12]]
  : After asking Govinda to put aside the quilt and pillow, the Lord lay down on the dry plantain bark.

  ; [[.13:13|Cc. Antya 13.13]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara said to the Lord, "I cannot contradict Your supreme will, my Lord, but if You do not accept the bedding, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita will feel great unhappiness."

  ; [[.13:14|Cc. Antya 13.14]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "You should bring a bedstead here for Me to lie on. Jagadānanda wants Me to enjoy material happiness.

  ; [[.13:15|Cc. Antya 13.15]]
  : "I am in the renounced order, and therefore I must lie on the floor. For Me to use a bedstead, quilt or pillow would be very shameful."

  ; [[.13:16|Cc. Antya 13.16]]
  : When Svarūpa Dāmodara returned and related all these incidents, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita felt very unhappy.

  ; [[.13:17|Cc. Antya 13.17]]
  : Then Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī devised another method. First he secured a large quantity of dry banana leaves.

  ; [[.13:18|Cc. Antya 13.18]]
  : He then tore the leaves into very fine fibers with his nails and filled two of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's outer garments with the fibers.

  ; [[.13:19|Cc. Antya 13.19]]
  : In this way, Svarūpa Dāmodara made some bedding and a pillow, and after much endeavor by the devotees, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted them.

  ; [[.13:20|Cc. Antya 13.20]]
  : Everyone was happy to see the Lord lie down on that bed, but Jagadānanda was inwardly angry, and externally he appeared very unhappy.

  ; [[.13:21|Cc. Antya 13.21]]
  : Formerly, when Jagadānanda Paṇḍita had desired to go to Vṛndāvana, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had not given His permission, and therefore he could not go.

  ; [[.13:22|Cc. Antya 13.22]]
  : Now, concealing his anger and unhappiness, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita again asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for permission to go to Mathurā.

  ; [[.13:23|Cc. Antya 13.23]]
  : With great affection, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "If you are angry with Me when you go to Mathurā, you will merely become a beggar and criticize Me."

  ; [[.13:24|Cc. Antya 13.24]]
  : Grasping the Lord's feet, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita then said, "For a long time I have desired to go to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.13:25|Cc. Antya 13.25]]
  : "I could not go without Your Lordship's permission. Now You must give me permission, and I shall certainly go there."

  ; [[.13:26|Cc. Antya 13.26]]
  : Because of affection for Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would not permit him to depart, but Jagadānanda Paṇḍita repeatedly insisted that the Lord give him permission to go.

  ; [[.13:27|Cc. Antya 13.27]]
  : He then submitted a plea to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. "For a very long time," he said, "I have wanted to go to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.13:28|Cc. Antya 13.28]]
  : "I cannot go there, however, without the Lord's permission, which at present He denies me. He says, 'You are going because you are angry at Me.'

  ; [[.13:29|Cc. Antya 13.29]]
  : "Naturally I have a desire to go to Vṛndāvana; therefore please humbly request Him to grant His permission."

  ; [[.13:30|Cc. Antya 13.30]]
  : Thereafter, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī submitted this appeal at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. "Jagadānanda Paṇḍita intensely desires to go to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.13:31|Cc. Antya 13.31]]
  : "He begs for Your permission again and again. Therefore, please permit him to go to Mathurā and then return.

  ; [[.13:32|Cc. Antya 13.32]]
  : "You permitted him to go see mother Śacī in Bengal, and You may similarly permit him to go see Vṛndāvana and then return here."

  ; [[.13:33|Cc. Antya 13.33]]
  : At the request of Svarūpa Dāmodara, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu granted Jagadānanda Paṇḍita permission to go. The Lord sent for him and instructed him as follows.

  ; [[.13:34|Cc. Antya 13.34]]
  : "You may go as far as Vārāṇasī without encountering disturbances, but beyond Vārāṇasī you should be very careful to travel on the path in the company of the kṣatriyas.

  ; [[.13:35|Cc. Antya 13.35]]
  : "As soon as the plunderers on the road see a Bengali traveling alone, they take everything from him, arrest him and do not let him go.

  ; [[.13:36|Cc. Antya 13.36]]
  : "When you reach Mathurā, you should remain with Sanātana Gosvāmī and offer respectful obeisances to the feet of all the leading men there.

  ; [[.13:37|Cc. Antya 13.37]]
  : "Do not mix freely with the residents of Mathurā; show them respect from a distance. Because you are on a different platform of devotional service, you cannot adopt their behavior and practices.

  ; [[.13:38|Cc. Antya 13.38]]
  : "Visit all twelve forests of Vṛndāvana in the company of Sanātana Gosvāmī. Do not leave his association for even a moment.

  ; [[.13:39|Cc. Antya 13.39]]
  : "You should remain in Vṛndāvana for only a short time and then return here as soon as possible. Also, do not climb Govardhana Hill to see the Gopāla Deity.

  ; [[.13:40|Cc. Antya 13.40]]
  : "Inform Sanātana Gosvāmī that I am coming to Vṛndāvana for a second time and that he should therefore arrange a place for Me to stay."

  ; [[.13:41|Cc. Antya 13.41]]
  : After saying this, the Lord embraced Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, who then worshiped the Lord's lotus feet and started for Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.13:42|Cc. Antya 13.42]]
  : He took permission from all the devotees and then departed. Traveling on the forest path, he soon reached Vārāṇasī.

  ; [[.13:43|Cc. Antya 13.43]]
  : When he met Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara in Vārāṇasī, they both heard from him about topics concerning Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:44|Cc. Antya 13.44]]
  : Finally Jagadānanda Paṇḍita reached Mathurā, where he met Sanātana Gosvāmī. They were very pleased to see each other.

  ; [[.13:45|Cc. Antya 13.45]]
  : After Sanātana Gosvāmī had taken Jagadānanda to see all twelve forests of Vṛndāvana, concluding with Mahāvana, they both remained in Gokula.

  ; [[.13:46|Cc. Antya 13.46]]
  : They stayed in Sanātana Gosvāmī's cave, but Jagadānanda Paṇḍita would go cook for himself at a nearby temple.

  ; [[.13:47|Cc. Antya 13.47]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī would beg alms from door to door in the vicinity of Mahāvana. Sometimes he would go to a temple and sometimes to a brāhmaṇa's house.

  ; [[.13:48|Cc. Antya 13.48]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī attended to all of Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's needs. He begged in the area of Mahāvana and brought Jagadānanda all kinds of things to eat and drink.

  ; [[.13:49|Cc. Antya 13.49]]
  : One day Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, having invited Sanātana to the nearby temple for lunch, finished his routine duties and began to cook.

  ; [[.13:50|Cc. Antya 13.50]]
  : Previously, a great sannyāsī named Mukunda Sarasvatī had given Sanātana Gosvāmī an outer garment.

  ; [[.13:51|Cc. Antya 13.51]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī was wearing this cloth bound about his head when he came to Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's door and sat down.

  ; [[.13:52|Cc. Antya 13.52]]
  : Assuming the reddish cloth to be a gift from Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita was overwhelmed with ecstatic love. Thus he questioned Sanātana Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.13:53|Cc. Antya 13.53]]
  : "Where did you get that reddish cloth on your head?" Jagadānanda asked. Sanātana Gosvāmī replied, "Mukunda Sarasvatī gave it to me."

  ; [[.13:54|Cc. Antya 13.54]]
  : Hearing this, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita was immediately very angry and took a cooking pot in his hand, intending to beat Sanātana Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.13:55|Cc. Antya 13.55]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, knew Jagadānanda Paṇḍita very well and was consequently somewhat ashamed. Jagadānanda therefore left the cooking pot on the stove and spoke as follows.

  ; [[.13:56|Cc. Antya 13.56]]
  : "You are one of the chief associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Indeed, no one is dearer to Him than you.

  ; [[.13:57|Cc. Antya 13.57]]
  : "Still, you have bound your head with a cloth given to you by another sannyāsī. Who can tolerate such behavior?"

  ; [[.13:58|Cc. Antya 13.58]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "My dear Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, you are a greatly learned saint. No one is dearer to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu than you.

  ; [[.13:59|Cc. Antya 13.59]]
  : "This faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fits you quite well. Unless you demonstrate it, how could I learn such faith?

  ; [[.13:60|Cc. Antya 13.60]]
  : "My purpose in binding my head with the cloth has now been fulfilled because I have personally seen your uncommon love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:61|Cc. Antya 13.61]]
  : "This saffron cloth is unfit for a Vaiṣṇava to wear; therefore I have no use for it. I shall give it to a stranger."

  ; [[.13:62|Cc. Antya 13.62]]
  : When Jagadānanda Paṇḍita finished cooking, he offered the food to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then he and Sanātana Gosvāmī sat down and ate the prasāda.

  ; [[.13:63|Cc. Antya 13.63]]
  : After eating the prasāda, they embraced each other and cried due to separation from Lord Caitanya.

  ; [[.13:64|Cc. Antya 13.64]]
  : They passed two months in Vṛndāvana in this way. Finally they could no longer tolerate the unhappiness of separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:65|Cc. Antya 13.65]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita therefore gave Sanātana Gosvāmī the message from the Lord: "I am also coming to Vṛndāvana; please arrange a place for Me to stay."

  ; [[.13:66|Cc. Antya 13.66]]
  : When Sanātana Gosvāmī granted permission for Jagadānanda to return to Jagannātha Purī, he gave Jagadānanda some gifts for Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:67|Cc. Antya 13.67]]
  : The gifts consisted of some sand from the site of the rāsa-līlā, a stone from Govardhana Hill, dry ripened pīlu fruits and a garland of small conchshells.

  ; [[.13:68|Cc. Antya 13.68]]
  : Thus Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, bearing all these gifts, started on his journey. Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, was very agitated after bidding him farewell.

  ; [[.13:69|Cc. Antya 13.69]]
  : Soon afterward, Sanātana Gosvāmī selected a place where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could stay while in Vṛndāvana. It was a temple in the highlands named Dvādaśāditya-ṭilā.

  ; [[.13:70|Cc. Antya 13.70]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī kept the temple very clean and in good repair. In front of it he erected a small hut.

  ; [[.13:71|Cc. Antya 13.71]]
  : Meanwhile, traveling very quickly, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita soon arrived in Jagannātha Purī, much to the joy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees.

  ; [[.13:72|Cc. Antya 13.72]]
  : After offering prayers at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita greeted everyone. Then the Lord embraced Jagadānanda very strongly.

  ; [[.13:73|Cc. Antya 13.73]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita also offered obeisances to the Lord on behalf of Sanātana Gosvāmī. Then he gave the Lord the dust from the site of the rāsa dance and the other gifts.

  ; [[.13:74|Cc. Antya 13.74]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu kept all the gifts except the pīlu fruits, which He distributed to the devotees. Because the fruits were from Vṛndāvana, everyone ate them with great happiness.

  ; [[.13:75|Cc. Antya 13.75]]
  : Those devotees who were familiar with pīlu fruits sucked on the seeds, but the Bengali devotees who did not know what they were chewed the seeds and swallowed them.

  ; [[.13:76|Cc. Antya 13.76]]
  : The hot chili-like taste burned the tongues of those who chewed the seeds. The eating of pīlu fruits from Vṛndāvana was a pastime for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:77|Cc. Antya 13.77]]
  : When Jagadānanda Paṇḍita returned from Vṛndāvana, everyone was jubilant. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed His pastimes while residing at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.13:78|Cc. Antya 13.78]]
  : One day when the Lord was going to the temple of Yameśvara, a female singer began to sing in the Jagannātha temple.

  ; [[.13:79|Cc. Antya 13.79]]
  : She sang a gujjarī tune in a very sweet voice, and because the subject was Jayadeva Gosvāmī's Gīta-govinda, the song attracted the attention of the entire world.

  ; [[.13:80|Cc. Antya 13.80]]
  : Hearing the song from a distance, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately became ecstatic. He did not know whether it was a man or a woman singing.

  ; [[.13:81|Cc. Antya 13.81]]
  : As the Lord ran in ecstasy to meet the singer, thorny hedges pricked His body.

  ; [[.13:82|Cc. Antya 13.82]]
  : Govinda ran very quickly behind the Lord, who did not feel any pain from the pricking of the thorns.

  ; [[.13:83|Cc. Antya 13.83]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was running very rapidly, and the girl was only a short distance away. Just then Govinda caught the Lord in his arms and cried, "It is a woman singing!"

  ; [[.13:84|Cc. Antya 13.84]]
  : As soon as He heard the word "woman," the Lord became externally conscious and turned back.

  ; [[.13:85|Cc. Antya 13.85]]
  : "My dear Govinda," He said, "you have saved My life. If I had touched the body of a woman, I would certainly have died.

  ; [[.13:86|Cc. Antya 13.86]]
  : "I shall never be able to repay My debt to you." Govinda replied, "Lord Jagannātha has saved You. I am insignificant."

  ; [[.13:87|Cc. Antya 13.87]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "My dear Govinda, you should stay with Me always. There is danger anywhere and everywhere; therefore you should protect Me very carefully."

  ; [[.13:88|Cc. Antya 13.88]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned home. When Svarūpa Gosvāmī and His other attendants heard about the incident, they were very afraid.

  ; [[.13:89|Cc. Antya 13.89]]
  : During this time, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya, the son of Tapana Miśra, gave up all his duties and left home, intending to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:90|Cc. Antya 13.90]]
  : Accompanied by one servant carrying his baggage, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa started from Vārāṇasī and traveled along the path leading through Bengal.

  ; [[.13:91|Cc. Antya 13.91]]
  : In Bengal he met Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa, who belonged to the kāyastha caste. He was one of the king's secretaries.

  ; [[.13:92|Cc. Antya 13.92]]
  : Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa was very learned in all the revealed scriptures. He was a teacher of the famous book Kāvya-prakāśa and was known as an advanced devotee and worshiper of Raghunātha [Lord Rāmacandra].

  ; [[.13:93|Cc. Antya 13.93]]
  : Rāmadāsa had renounced everything and was going to see Lord Jagannātha. While traveling, he chanted the holy name of Lord Rāma twenty-four hours a day.

  ; [[.13:94|Cc. Antya 13.94]]
  : When he met Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa on the way, he took Raghunātha's baggage on his head and carried it.

  ; [[.13:95|Cc. Antya 13.95]]
  : Rāmadāsa served Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa in various ways, even massaging his legs. Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa felt some hesitation in accepting all this service.

  ; [[.13:96|Cc. Antya 13.96]]
  : "You are a respectable gentleman, a learned scholar and a great devotee," he said. "Please do not try to serve me. Just come with me in a happy mood."

  ; [[.13:97|Cc. Antya 13.97]]
  : Rāmadāsa replied, "I am a śūdra, a fallen soul. To serve a brāhmaṇa is my duty and religious principle.

  ; [[.13:98|Cc. Antya 13.98]]
  : "Therefore please do not be hesitant. I am your servant, and when I serve you my heart becomes jubilant."

  ; [[.13:99|Cc. Antya 13.99]]
  : Thus Rāmadāsa carried the baggage of Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa and served him sincerely. He constantly chanted the holy name of Lord Rāmacandra day and night.

  ; [[.13:100|Cc. Antya 13.100]]
  : Traveling in this way, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa soon arrived at Jagannātha Purī. There, with great delight, he met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and fell at His lotus feet.

  ; [[.13:101|Cc. Antya 13.101]]
  : Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa fell straight as a rod at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then the Lord embraced him, knowing well who he was.

  ; [[.13:102|Cc. Antya 13.102]]
  : Raghunātha offered respectful obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu on behalf of Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara, and the Lord also inquired about them.

  ; [[.13:103|Cc. Antya 13.103]]
  : "It is very good that you have come here," the Lord said. "Now go see the lotus-eyed Lord Jagannātha. Today you will accept prasāda here at My place."

  ; [[.13:104|Cc. Antya 13.104]]
  : The Lord asked Govinda to arrange for Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa's accommodations and then introduced him to all the devotees, headed by Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.13:105|Cc. Antya 13.105]]
  : Thus Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa lived with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continuously for eight months, and by the Lord's mercy he felt increased transcendental happiness every day.

  ; [[.13:106|Cc. Antya 13.106]]
  : He would periodically cook rice with various vegetables and invite Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to his home.

  ; [[.13:107|Cc. Antya 13.107]]
  : Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa was an expert cook. Whatever he prepared tasted just like nectar.

  ; [[.13:108|Cc. Antya 13.108]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would accept with great satisfaction all the food he prepared. After the Lord was satisfied, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa would eat His remnants.

  ; [[.13:109|Cc. Antya 13.109]]
  : When Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord did not show him any special mercy, although this was their first meeting.

  ; [[.13:110|Cc. Antya 13.110]]
  : Within his heart, Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa was an impersonalist who desired to merge into the existence of the Lord, and he was very proud of his learning. Being the omniscient Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu can understand the heart of everyone, and thus He knew all these things.

  ; [[.13:111|Cc. Antya 13.111]]
  : Rāmadāsa Viśvāsa then took up residence in Jagannātha Purī and taught the Kāvya-prakāśa to the Paṭṭanāyaka family [the descendants of Bhavānanda Rāya].

  ; [[.13:112|Cc. Antya 13.112]]
  : After eight months, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade farewell to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, the Lord flatly forbade him to marry. "Do not marry," the Lord said.

  ; [[.13:113|Cc. Antya 13.113]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, "When you return home, serve your aged father and mother, who are devotees, and try to study Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from a pure Vaiṣṇava who has realized God."

  ; [[.13:114|Cc. Antya 13.114]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu concluded, "Come again to Nīlācala [Jagannātha Purī]." After saying this, the Lord put His own neck beads on Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa's neck.

  ; [[.13:115|Cc. Antya 13.115]]
  : Then the Lord embraced him and bade him farewell. Overwhelmed with ecstatic love, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa began to cry due to imminent separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:116|Cc. Antya 13.116]]
  : After taking permission from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the devotees, headed by Svarūpa Dāmodara, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa returned to Vārāṇasī.

  ; [[.13:117|Cc. Antya 13.117]]
  : In accordance with the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he continuously rendered service to his mother and father for four years. He also regularly studied the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from a self-realized Vaiṣṇava.

  ; [[.13:118|Cc. Antya 13.118]]
  : Then his parents died at Kāśī [Vārāṇasī], and he became detached. He therefore returned to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, giving up all relationships with his home.

  ; [[.13:119|Cc. Antya 13.119]]
  : As previously, Raghunātha remained continuously with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for eight months. Then the Lord gave him the following order.

  ; [[.13:120|Cc. Antya 13.120]]
  : "My dear Raghunātha, go to Vṛndāvana, following My instructions, and place yourself under the care of Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmīs.

  ; [[.13:121|Cc. Antya 13.121]]
  : "In Vṛndāvana you should chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra twenty-four hours a day and read Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam continuously. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will very soon bestow His mercy upon you."

  ; [[.13:122|Cc. Antya 13.122]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, and by the Lord's mercy Raghunātha was enlivened with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:123|Cc. Antya 13.123]]
  : At a festival Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had been given some unspiced betel and a garland of tulasī leaves fourteen cubits long. The garland had been worn by Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.13:124|Cc. Antya 13.124]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave the garland and betel to Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, who accepted them as a worshipable Deity, preserving them very carefully.

  ; [[.13:125|Cc. Antya 13.125]]
  : Taking permission from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa then departed for Vṛndāvana. When he arrived there, he put himself under the care of Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmīs.

  ; [[.13:126|Cc. Antya 13.126]]
  : When reciting Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in the company of Rūpa and Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa would be overwhelmed with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:127|Cc. Antya 13.127]]
  : By the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he experienced the symptoms of ecstatic love-tears, trembling, and faltering of the voice. His eyes filled with tears, his throat became choked, and thus he could not recite Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

  ; [[.13:128|Cc. Antya 13.128]]
  : His voice was as sweet as a cuckoo's, and he would recite each verse of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in three or four tunes. Thus his recitations were very sweet to hear.

  ; [[.13:129|Cc. Antya 13.129]]
  : When he recited or heard about the beauty and sweetness of Kṛṣṇa, he would be overwhelmed with ecstatic love and become oblivious to everything.

  ; [[.13:130|Cc. Antya 13.130]]
  : Thus Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa surrendered fully at the lotus feet of Lord Govinda, and those lotus feet became his life and soul.

  ; [[.13:131|Cc. Antya 13.131]]
  : Subsequently Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa ordered his disciples to construct a temple for Govinda. He prepared various ornaments for Govinda, including a flute and earrings shaped like sharks

  ; [[.13:132|Cc. Antya 13.132]]
  : Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa would neither hear nor speak about anything of the material world. He would simply discuss Kṛṣṇa and worship the Lord day and night.

  ; [[.13:133|Cc. Antya 13.133]]
  : He would not listen to blasphemy of a Vaiṣṇava, nor would he listen to talk of a Vaiṣṇava's misbehavior. He knew only that everyone was engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service; he did not understand anything else.

  ; [[.13:134|Cc. Antya 13.134]]
  : When Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī was absorbed in remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he would take the tulasī garland and the prasāda of Lord Jagannātha given to him by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, bind them together and wear them on his neck.

  ; [[.13:135|Cc. Antya 13.135]]
  : Thus I have described the powerful mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by which Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī remained constantly overwhelmed with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.13:136-137|Cc. Antya 13.136-137]]
  : In this chapter I have spoken about three topics: Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's visit to Vṛndāvana, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's listening to the song of the deva-dāsī at the temple of Jagannātha, and how Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī achieved ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.13:138|Cc. Antya 13.138]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu [Gaurahari] bestows ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa upon anyone who hears all these topics with faith and love.

  ; [[.13:139|Cc. Antya 13.139]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
