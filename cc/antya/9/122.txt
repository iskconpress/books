Near Rājamahendrī is a famous railway station. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī notes that the present Rājamahendrī City is located on the northern bank of the Godāvarī. At the time when Rāmānanda Rāya was governor, however, the state capital, which was known as Vidyānagara or Vidyāpura, was located on the southern side of the Godāvarī, at the confluence of the Godāvarī and the sea. That was the part of the country which at that time was known as Rājamahendrī. North of Kaliṅga-deśa is Utkaliṅga, or the state of Orissa. The capital of southern Orissa was known as Rājamahendrī, but now the location of Rājamahendrī has changed.
