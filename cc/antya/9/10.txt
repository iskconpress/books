According to the opinion of some historians, Prahlāda Mahārāja was born in Tretā-yuga in the city of Mūlatāna in the state of Punjab. He was born of Hiraṇyakaśipu, a king of the dynasty of Kaśyapa. Prahlāda Mahārāja was a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, but his father was very much against Viṣṇu. Because the father and son thus differed in their consciousness, the demon father inflicted all kinds of bodily pain upon Prahlāda. When this torture became intolerable, the Supreme Lord appeared as Nṛsiṁhadeva and killed the great demon Hiraṇyakaśipu.

Bali Mahārāja was the grandson of Prahlāda Mahārāja. The son of Prahlāda Mahārāja was Virocana, and his son was known as Bali. Appearing as Vāmana and begging Bali Mahārāja for three feet of land, the Lord took possession of the entire three worlds. Thus Bali Mahārāja became a great devotee of Lord Vāmana. Bali Mahārāja had one hundred sons, of whom Mahārāja Bāṇa was the eldest and most famous.

Vyāsadeva was the son of the great sage Parāśara. Other names for him are Sātyavateya and Kṛṣṇa-dvaipāyana Bādarāyaṇa Muni. As one of the authorities on the //Vedas,// he divided the original //Veda,// for convenience, into four divisions-//Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg// and //Atharva.// He is the author of eighteen //Purāṇas// as well as the theosophical thesis //Brahma-sūtra// and its natural commentary, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He belongs to the Brahma-sampradāya and is a direct disciple of Nārada Muni.

Śukadeva Gosvāmī is the son of Vyāsadeva. He was a //brahmacārī// fully conscious of Brahman realization, but later he became a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He narrated //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to Mahārāja Parīkṣit.
