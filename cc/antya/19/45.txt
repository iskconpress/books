This verse, quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.39.19), was chanted by the damsels of Vraja when Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana for Mathurā with Akrūra and Balarāma. The //gopīs// lamented that providence had made it possible for them to meet Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in affection and love and had then separated them.
