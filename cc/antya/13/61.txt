Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on this incident as follows: Vaiṣṇavas are all liberated persons, unattached to anything material. Therefore a Vaiṣṇava need not accept the dress of a //sannyāsī// to prove his exalted position. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the renounced order from a //sannyāsī// of the //Māyāvāda// school. Present-day Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// however, never think that by accepting the dress of the //sannyāsa// order they have become equal to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In fact, a Vaiṣṇava accepts the //sannyāsa// order to remain an eternal servant of his spiritual master. He accepts the //sannyāsa// order knowing that he is unequal to his spiritual master, who is a //paramahaṁsa,// and he thinks that he is unfit to dress like a //paramahaṁsa.// Therefore a Vaiṣṇava accepts //sannyāsa// out of humility, not out of pride.

Sanātana Gosvāmī had adopted the dress of a //paramahaṁsa;// therefore it was inappropriate for him to wear the saffron cloth on his head. However, a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// does not think himself fit to imitate the dress of a //paramahaṁsa// Vaiṣṇava. According to the principles set down by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu //(tṛṇād api sunīcena),// one should always think himself in the lowest stage, not on the level of a //paramahaṁsa// Vaiṣṇava. Thus a Vaiṣṇava will sometimes accept the //sannyāsa// order just to keep himself below the level of a //paramahaṁsa// Vaiṣṇava. This is the instruction of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.
