===== Purport =====

This passage parallels the statement k//ṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana,// which means that unless empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, one cannot spread the holy name of the Lord throughout the entire world [[books:cc:antya:7:11|(Cc. Antya 7.11)]]. Under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a pure devotee can preach the holy name of the Lord so that everyone may take advantage of this facility and thus become Kṛṣṇa conscious.
