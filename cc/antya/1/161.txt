{{description>The flute of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes measures three fingers in length, and it is bedecked with indra-nīla gems. At the ends of the flute are aruṇa gems [rubies], glittering beautifully, and in between the flute is plated with gold, set ablaze by diamonds. This auspicious flute, pleasing to Kṛṣṇa, is glittering in His hand with transcendental brilliance.'}}
