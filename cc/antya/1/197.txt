The Supreme personality of Godhead is not partial to some and neutral to others. One can actually draw the attention of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by service. Then one is further empowered by the Lord to act in such a way that everyone can appreciate his service. This is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]]: //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham.// Kṛṣṇa is responsive. If one tries to render his best service to the Lord, the Lord gives him the power to do so. Kṛṣṇa also says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]:

"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bestowed His special favor upon Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī because Rūpa Gosvāmī wanted to serve the Lord to the best of his ability. Such is the reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord in the discharge of devotional duties.
