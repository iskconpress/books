{{description>The dust from cows and calves on the road creates a kind of darkness indicating that Kṛṣṇa is returning home from the pasture. Also, the darkness of evening provokes the gopīs to meet Kṛṣṇa. Thus the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and the gopīs are covered by a kind of transcendental darkness and are therefore impossible for ordinary scholars of the Vedas to see.'}}

===== Purport =====

This verse from the //Lalita-mādhava// (1.23) is spoken by Paurṇamāsī in a conversation with Gārgī.

Kṛṣṇa stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna.// Thus He advised Arjuna to rise above the modes of material nature, for the entire Vedic system is filled with descriptions involving //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// People are generally covered by the quality of //rajo-guṇa// and are therefore unable to understand the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the //gopīs// of Vraja. Moreover, the quality of //tamo-guṇa// further disturbs their understanding. In Vṛndāvana, however, although Kṛṣṇa is covered by the hazy darkness of the dust, the //gopīs// can nevertheless understand that within the dust storm is Kṛṣṇa. Because they are His topmost devotees, they can perceive His hand in everything. Thus even in the dark or in a hazy storm of dust, devotees can understand what Kṛṣṇa is doing. The purport of this verse is that Kṛṣṇa is never lost, under any circumstances, to the vision of exalted devotees like the //gopīs.//
