Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura interprets this verse (//Vidagdha-mādhava// 1.10) in two ways, for Lord Kṛṣṇa and for Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. When interpreted for Kṛṣṇa, the night is understood to have been a dark moon night, and when interpreted for Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, it is considered to have been a full moon night.
