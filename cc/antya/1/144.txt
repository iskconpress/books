===== Purport =====

This verse (//Vidagdha-mādhava// 2.33) is written in the Prākṛta language, not in Sanskrit. When transformed into Sanskrit, it reads as follows:

> dhṛtvā praticchanda-guṇaṁ sundara mama mandire tvaṁ vasasi
> tathā tathā ruṇatsi balitaṁ yathā yathā cakitā palāye

The meaning is the same, but the native language is different. It //was// spoken by Madhumaṅgala to Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
