Following in the footsteps of Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, I am trying to translate //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as quickly as possible. However, knowing myself to be an old man and almost an invalid because of rheumatism, I have already translated the essence of all literatures, the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// as a summary study in English. I started the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement at the age of seventy. Now I am seventy-eight, and so my death is imminent. I am trying to finish the translation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as soon as possible, but before finishing it, I have given my readers the book //Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,// so that if I die before finishing the whole task they may enjoy this book, which is the essence of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//
