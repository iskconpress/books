This verse (//Vidagdha-mādhava// 1.2) also appears in //Ādi-līlā// (1.4 and 3.4). In his commentary on //Vidagdha-mādhava,// Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī  Ṭhākura remarks: //mahā-prabhoḥ sphūrtiṁ vinā hari-līlā-rasāsvādanānupapatter iti bhāvaḥ.// Without the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one cannot describe the pastimes of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī said, //vaḥ yuṣmākaṁ hṛdaya-rūpa-guhā yāṁ śacī-nandano hariḥ, pakṣe, siṁhaḥ sphuratu:// "May Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is exactly like a lion that kills all the elephants of desire, be awakened within everyone's heart, for by His merciful blessings one can understand the transcendental pastimes of Kṛṣṇa."
