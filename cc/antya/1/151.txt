{{description>'Upon hearing of My cruelty, moon-faced Rādhārāṇī may establish some kind of tolerance in Her aggrieved heart. But then She might turn against Me. Or, indeed, being fearful of the lusty desires invoked by the bow of formidable Cupid, She might even give up Her life. Alas! I have foolishly uprooted the soft creeper of Her desire just when it was ready to bear fruit.'}}

Having been very cruel to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Kṛṣṇa is repenting in this way ( //Vidagdha-mādhava// 2.40).
