~~Title:Cc. Antya 12: The Loving Dealings Between Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Jagadānanda Paṇḍita~~

====== The Loving Dealings Between Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Jagadānanda Paṇḍita ======

A summary of the Twelfth Chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya// as follows. This chapter discusses the transformations of ecstatic love that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited day and night. The devotees from Bengal again journeyed to Jagannātha Purī to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As usual, the leader was Śivānanda Sena, who traveled with his wife and children. Because arrangements were delayed en route and Lord Nityānanda did not have a suitable place to reside, He became somewhat disturbed. Thus He became very angry with Śivānanda Sena, who was in charge of the affairs of the party, and kicked him in loving anger. Śivānanda Sena felt highly favored to have been kicked by Nityānanda Prabhu, but his nephew Śrīkānta Sena became upset and therefore left their company. He met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī before the rest of the party arrived.

That year a devotee named Parameśvara dāsa Modaka also went with his family to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. The devotees often invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to eat with them. When the Lord bade them all farewell, He talked very pleasingly with them. The year before, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita had been sent to Śacīmātā with //prasāda// and cloth. This year he returned to Purī with a big pot of floral-scented oil to massage the Lord's head. The Lord, however, would not accept the oil, and because of His refusal, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita broke the pot in front of Him and began to fast. The Lord tried to pacify him and asked Jagadānanda Paṇḍita to cook for Him. Jagadānanda Paṇḍita became so pleased when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted his cooking that he broke his fast.

  ; [[.12:1|Cc. Antya 12.1]]
  : O devotees, may the transcendental life and characteristics of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu be always heard, chanted and meditated upon with great happiness.

  ; [[.12:2|Cc. Antya 12.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is all-merciful! All glories to Nityānanda Prabhu, who is an ocean of mercy!

  ; [[.12:3|Cc. Antya 12.3]]
  : All glories to Advaita Ācārya, who is also an ocean of mercy! All glories to all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whose hearts are always filled with mercy!

  ; [[.12:4|Cc. Antya 12.4]]
  : The mind of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always morose because of a continuously manifested feeling of separation from Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.12:5|Cc. Antya 12.5]]
  : The Lord would cry, "O My Lord Kṛṣṇa, My life and soul! O son of Mahārāja Nanda, where shall I go? Where shall I attain You? O Supreme Personality who plays with Your flute to Your mouth!"

  ; [[.12:6|Cc. Antya 12.6]]
  : This was His situation day and night. Unable to find peace of mind, He passed His nights with great difficulty in the company of Svarūpa Dāmodara and Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.12:7|Cc. Antya 12.7]]
  : Meanwhile, all the devotees journeyed from their homes in Bengal to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.12:8|Cc. Antya 12.8]]
  : Headed by Śivānanda Sena, Advaita Ācārya and others, all the devotees assembled in Navadvīpa.

  ; [[.12:9|Cc. Antya 12.9]]
  : The inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma and Khaṇḍa village also assembled at Navadvīpa.

  ; [[.12:10|Cc. Antya 12.10]]
  : Because Nityānanda Prabhu was preaching in Bengal, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had ordered Him not to come to Jagannātha Purī. That year, however, He went with the rest of the party to see the Lord.

  ; [[.12:11|Cc. Antya 12.11]]
  : Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura was also there with his three brothers and his wife, Mālinī. Ācāryaratna was similarly accompanied by his wife.

  ; [[.12:12|Cc. Antya 12.12]]
  : The wife of Śivānanda Sena also came, along with their three sons. Rāghava Paṇḍita joined them, carrying his famous bags of food.

  ; [[.12:13|Cc. Antya 12.13]]
  : Vāsudeva Datta, Murāri Gupta, Vidyānidhi and many other devotees went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All together, they numbered two or three hundred.

  ; [[.12:14|Cc. Antya 12.14]]
  : The devotees first saw Śacīmātā and took her permission. Then, in great happiness, they started for Jagannātha Purī, congregationally chanting the holy name of the Lord.

  ; [[.12:15|Cc. Antya 12.15]]
  : Śivānanda Sena managed the payment of tolls at different places. Maintaining everyone, he guided all the devotees in great happiness.

  ; [[.12:16|Cc. Antya 12.16]]
  : Śivānanda Sena took care of everyone and gave each devotee places to stay. He knew all the paths leading to Orissa.

  ; [[.12:17|Cc. Antya 12.17]]
  : One day when the party was being checked by a toll collector, the devotees were allowed to pass, and Śivānanda Sena remained behind alone to pay the taxes.

  ; [[.12:18|Cc. Antya 12.18]]
  : The party went into a village and waited beneath a tree because no one but Śivānanda Sena could arrange for their residential quarters.

  ; [[.12:19|Cc. Antya 12.19]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu meanwhile became very hungry and upset. Because He had not yet obtained a suitable residence, He began calling Śivānanda Sena ill names.

  ; [[.12:20|Cc. Antya 12.20]]
  : "Śivānanda Sena has not arranged for My residence," He complained, "and I am so hungry I could die. Because he has not come, I curse his three sons to die."

  ; [[.12:21|Cc. Antya 12.21]]
  : Hearing this curse, Śivānanda Sena's wife began to cry. Just then, Śivānanda returned from the toll station.

  ; [[.12:22|Cc. Antya 12.22]]
  : Crying, his wife informed him, "Lord Nityānanda has cursed our sons to die because His quarters have not been provided."

  ; [[.12:23|Cc. Antya 12.23]]
  : Śivānanda Sena replied, "You crazy woman! Why are you needlessly crying? Let my three sons die for all the inconvenience we have caused Nityānanda Prabhu."

  ; [[.12:24|Cc. Antya 12.24]]
  : After saying this, Śivānanda Sena went to Nityānanda Prabhu, who then stood up and kicked him.

  ; [[.12:25|Cc. Antya 12.25]]
  : Very pleased at being kicked, Śivānanda Sena quickly arranged for a milkman's house to be the Lord's residence.

  ; [[.12:26|Cc. Antya 12.26]]
  : Śivānanda Sena touched the lotus feet of Nityānanda Prabhu and led Him to His residence. After giving the Lord His quarters, Śivānanda Sena, being very pleased, spoke as follows.

  ; [[.12:27|Cc. Antya 12.27]]
  : "Today You have accepted me as Your servant and have properly punished me for my offense.

  ; [[.12:28|Cc. Antya 12.28]]
  : "My dear Lord, Your chastising me is Your causeless mercy. Who within the three worlds can understand Your real character?

  ; [[.12:29|Cc. Antya 12.29]]
  : "The dust of Your lotus feet is not attainable even by Lord Brahmā, yet Your lotus feet have touched my wretched body.

  ; [[.12:30|Cc. Antya 12.30]]
  : "Today my birth, my family and my activities have all become successful. Today I have achieved the fulfillment of religious principles, economic development, satisfaction of the senses and ultimately devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.12:31|Cc. Antya 12.31]]
  : When Lord Nityānanda heard this, He was very happy. He rose and embraced Śivānanda Sena in great love.

  ; [[.12:32|Cc. Antya 12.32]]
  : Being very pleased by Nityānanda Prabhu's behavior, Śivānanda Sena began to arrange residential quarters for all the Vaiṣṇavas, headed by Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.12:33|Cc. Antya 12.33]]
  : One of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu's characteristics is His contradictory nature. When He becomes angry and kicks someone, it is actually to his benefit.

  ; [[.12:34|Cc. Antya 12.34]]
  : Śivānanda Sena's nephew, Śrīkānta, the son of his sister, felt offended, and he commented on the matter when his uncle was absent.

  ; [[.12:35|Cc. Antya 12.35]]
  : "My uncle is well known as one of the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but Lord Nityānanda Prabhu asserts His superiority by kicking him."

  ; [[.12:36|Cc. Antya 12.36]]
  : After saying this, Śrīkānta, who was only a boy, left the group and traveled on alone to the residence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.12:37|Cc. Antya 12.37]]
  : When Śrīkānta offered obeisances to the Lord, he was still wearing his shirt and coat. Therefore Govinda told him, "My dear Śrīkānta, first take off these garments."

  ; [[.12:38|Cc. Antya 12.38]]
  : As Govinda was warning Śrīkānta, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Don't bother him. Let Śrīkānta do whatever he likes, for he has come here in a distressed state of mind."

  ; [[.12:39|Cc. Antya 12.39]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired from Śrīkānta about all the Vaiṣṇavas, and the boy informed the Lord about them, naming them one after another.

  ; [[.12:40|Cc. Antya 12.40]]
  : When Śrīkānta Sena heard the Lord say, "He is distressed," he could understand that the Lord is omniscient.

  ; [[.12:41|Cc. Antya 12.41]]
  : As he described the Vaiṣṇavas, therefore, he did not mention Lord Nitya-nanda's kicking Śivānanda Sena. Meanwhile, all the devotees arrived and went to meet the Lord.

  ; [[.12:42|Cc. Antya 12.42]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received them all, just as He had in previous years. The women, however, saw the Lord from a distance.

  ; [[.12:43|Cc. Antya 12.43]]
  : The Lord again arranged for the residential quarters of all the devotees and thereafter called them to partake of the remnants of food offered to Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.12:44|Cc. Antya 12.44]]
  : Śivānanda Sena introduced his three sons to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because they were his sons, the Lord showed the boys great mercy.

  ; [[.12:45|Cc. Antya 12.45]]
  : Lord Caitanya asked the youngest son's name, and Śivānanda Sena informed the Lord that his name was Paramānanda dāsa.

  ; [[.12:46-47|Cc. Antya 12.46-47]]
  : Once before when Śivānanda Sena had visited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at His residence, the Lord had told him, "When this son is born, give him the name Purī dāsa."

  ; [[.12:48|Cc. Antya 12.48]]
  : The son was in the womb of his wife, and when he returned home the son was born.

  ; [[.12:49|Cc. Antya 12.49]]
  : The child was named Paramānanda dāsa in accordance with the Lord's order, and the Lord jokingly called him Purī dāsa.

  ; [[.12:50|Cc. Antya 12.50]]
  : When Śivānanda Sena introduced the child to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord put His toe in the child's mouth.

  ; [[.12:51|Cc. Antya 12.51]]
  : No one can cross over the ocean of Śivānanda Sena's good fortune, for the Lord considered Śivānanda's whole family His own.

  ; [[.12:52|Cc. Antya 12.52]]
  : The Lord ate lunch in the company of all the other devotees, and after washing His hands and mouth He gave an order to Govinda.

  ; [[.12:53|Cc. Antya 12.53]]
  : "As long as Śivānanda Sena's wife and children stay in Jagannātha Purī," He said, "they must be given the remnants of My food."

  ; [[.12:54|Cc. Antya 12.54]]
  : There was a resident of Nadia named Parameśvara, who was a confectioner living near the home of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.12:55|Cc. Antya 12.55]]
  : When the Lord was a boy, He would visit the house of Parameśvara Modaka again and again. The confectioner would supply the Lord milk and sweetmeats, and the Lord would eat them.

  ; [[.12:56|Cc. Antya 12.56]]
  : Parameśvara Modaka had been affectionate toward the Lord since His childhood, and he was one of those who came that year to see the Lord at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.12:57|Cc. Antya 12.57]]
  : When he offered his obeisances to the Lord, he said, "I am the same Parameśvara." Upon seeing him, the Lord asked him questions with great affection.

  ; [[.12:58|Cc. Antya 12.58]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Parameśvara, may you be blessed. It is very good that you have come here." Parameśvara then informed the Lord, "Mukundāra Mātā has also come."

  ; [[.12:59|Cc. Antya 12.59]]
  : Hearing the name of Mukundāra Mātā, Lord Caitanya hesitated, but because of affection for Parameśvara, He did not say anything.

  ; [[.12:60|Cc. Antya 12.60]]
  : An intimate relationship sometimes makes a person overstep formal etiquette. Thus Parameśvara actually pleased the Lord in His heart by his simple and affectionate behavior.

  ; [[.12:61|Cc. Antya 12.61]]
  : All the devotees engaged in the cleansing ceremony of the Guṇḍicā temple and danced in front of the Ratha-yātrā chariot, just as they had done in the past.

  ; [[.12:62|Cc. Antya 12.62]]
  : For four consecutive months, the devotees observed all the festivals. The wives, such as Mālinī, extended invitations for lunch to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.12:63|Cc. Antya 12.63]]
  : From Bengal the devotees had brought varieties of Bengali food that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu liked. They also cooked various grains and vegetables in their homes and offered them to the Lord.

  ; [[.12:64|Cc. Antya 12.64]]
  : During the day, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu engaged in various activities with His devotees, but at night He felt great separation from Kṛṣṇa and used to cry.

  ; [[.12:65|Cc. Antya 12.65]]
  : In this way the Lord spent the four months of the rainy season in various pastimes, and then He ordered the Bengali devotees to return to their homes.

  ; [[.12:66|Cc. Antya 12.66]]
  : All the devotees from Bengal would regularly invite Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for lunch, and the Lord would speak to them in very sweet words.

  ; [[.12:67|Cc. Antya 12.67]]
  : "All of you come to see Me every year," the Lord said. "To come here and then return must certainly give you great trouble.

  ; [[.12:68|Cc. Antya 12.68]]
  : "I would like to forbid you to do this, but I enjoy your company so much that My desire for your association only increases.

  ; [[.12:69|Cc. Antya 12.69]]
  : "I ordered Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu not to leave Bengal, but He has transgressed My order and come to see Me. What can I say?

  ; [[.12:70|Cc. Antya 12.70]]
  : "Out of His causeless mercy upon Me, Advaita Ācārya has also come here. I am indebted to Him for His affectionate behavior. This debt is impossible for Me to liquidate.

  ; [[.12:71|Cc. Antya 12.71]]
  : "All My devotees come here just for Me. Leaving aside their homes and families, they travel by very difficult paths to come here in great haste.

  ; [[.12:72|Cc. Antya 12.72]]
  : "There is no fatigue or trouble for Me, for I stay here at Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī, and do not move at all. This is the favor of all of you.

  ; [[.12:73|Cc. Antya 12.73]]
  : "I am a mendicant and have no money. How can I clear My debt for the favor you have shown Me?

  ; [[.12:74|Cc. Antya 12.74]]
  : "I have only this body, and therefore I surrender it unto you. Now, if you wish, you may sell it anywhere you like. It is your property."

  ; [[.12:75|Cc. Antya 12.75]]
  : When all the devotees heard these sweet words of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, their hearts melted, and they began to shed incessant tears.

  ; [[.12:76|Cc. Antya 12.76]]
  : Catching hold of His devotees, the Lord embraced them all and began to cry and cry.

  ; [[.12:77|Cc. Antya 12.77]]
  : Unable to leave, everyone remained there, and five to seven more days thus passed by.

  ; [[.12:78|Cc. Antya 12.78]]
  : Advaita Prabhu and Lord Nityānanda Prabhu submitted these words at the lotus feet of the Lord: "The entire world is naturally obligated to You for Your transcendental attributes.

  ; [[.12:79|Cc. Antya 12.79]]
  : "Yet You bind Your devotees again with Your sweet words. Under these circumstances, who can go anywhere?"

  ; [[.12:80|Cc. Antya 12.80]]
  : Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu peacefully calmed them all and bade each of them farewell.

  ; [[.12:81|Cc. Antya 12.81]]
  : The Lord specifically advised Nityānanda Prabhu, "You should not come here again and again. You will have My association in Bengal."

  ; [[.12:82|Cc. Antya 12.82]]
  : The devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began their journey crying, while the Lord remained morosely at His residence.

  ; [[.12:83|Cc. Antya 12.83]]
  : The Lord bound everyone by His transcendental mercy. Who can repay his debt for the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu?

  ; [[.12:84|Cc. Antya 12.84]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the fully independent Personality of Godhead and makes everyone dance as He likes. Leaving His company, therefore, all the devotees returned to their homes in different parts of the country.

  ; [[.12:85|Cc. Antya 12.85]]
  : As a wooden doll dances to the will of a puppeteer, everything is accomplished by the will of the Lord. Who can understand the characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?

  ; [[.12:86|Cc. Antya 12.86]]
  : The previous year, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, following the Lord's order, had returned to the city of Nadia to see Śacīmātā.

  ; [[.12:87|Cc. Antya 12.87]]
  : When he arrived, he offered prayers at her lotus feet and then offered her the cloth and prasāda of Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.12:88|Cc. Antya 12.88]]
  : He offered obeisances to Śacīmātā in the name of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and informed her of all the Lord's submissive prayers to her.

  ; [[.12:89|Cc. Antya 12.89]]
  : Jagadānanda's coming pleased mother Śacī very much. As he talked of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, she listened day and night.

  ; [[.12:90|Cc. Antya 12.90]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita said, "My dear mother, sometimes the Lord comes here and eats all the food you have offered.

  ; [[.12:91|Cc. Antya 12.91]]
  : "After eating the food, the Lord says, 'Today, mother has fed Me up to My neck.

  ; [[.12:92|Cc. Antya 12.92]]
  : "I go there and eat the food My mother offers, but she cannot understand that I am eating it directly. She thinks that this is a dream.' "

  ; [[.12:93|Cc. Antya 12.93]]
  : Śacīmātā said, "I wish Nimāi would eat all the nice vegetables I cook. That is my desire.

  ; [[.12:94|Cc. Antya 12.94]]
  : "Sometimes I think that Nimāi has eaten them, but afterwards I think that I was only dreaming."

  ; [[.12:95|Cc. Antya 12.95]]
  : In this way, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and mother Śacī talked day and night about the happiness of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.12:96|Cc. Antya 12.96]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita met all the other devotees in Nadia. They were all very happy to have him present.

  ; [[.12:97|Cc. Antya 12.97]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita thereafter went to meet Advaita Ācārya, who also was very happy to have him.

  ; [[.12:98|Cc. Antya 12.98]]
  : Vāsudeva Datta and Murāri Gupta were so pleased to see Jagadānanda Paṇḍita that they kept him at their homes and would not allow him to leave.

  ; [[.12:99|Cc. Antya 12.99]]
  : They heard confidential narrations about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu from the mouth of Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and forgot themselves in the great happiness of hearing about the Lord.

  ; [[.12:100|Cc. Antya 12.100]]
  : Whenever Jagadānanda Paṇḍita went to visit a devotee's house, that devotee immediately forgot himself in great happiness.

  ; [[.12:101|Cc. Antya 12.101]]
  : All glories to Jagadānanda Paṇḍita! He is so favored by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that anyone who meets him thinks, "Now I have gotten the association of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu directly."

  ; [[.12:102|Cc. Antya 12.102]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita stayed at Śivānanda Sena's house for some time, and they prepared about sixteen seers of scented sandalwood oil.

  ; [[.12:103|Cc. Antya 12.103]]
  : They filled a large earthen pot with the aromatic oil, and with great care Jagadānanda Paṇḍita brought it to Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.12:104|Cc. Antya 12.104]]
  : This oil was placed in the care of Govinda, and Jagadānanda requested him, "Please rub this oil on the body of the Lord."

  ; [[.12:105|Cc. Antya 12.105]]
  : Govinda therefore told Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Jagadānanda Paṇḍita has brought some scented sandalwood oil.

  ; [[.12:106|Cc. Antya 12.106]]
  : "It is his desire that Your Lordship apply a little of this oil on Your head so that blood pressure due to bile and air will be considerably diminished.

  ; [[.12:107|Cc. Antya 12.107]]
  : "He prepared a large jug of it in Bengal, and with great care he has brought it here."

  ; [[.12:108|Cc. Antya 12.108]]
  : The Lord replied, "A sannyāsī has no use for oil, especially perfumed oil such as this. Take it out immediately."

  ; [[.12:109|Cc. Antya 12.109]]
  : "Deliver this oil to the temple of Jagannātha, where it may be burned in the lamps. In this way, Jagadānanda's labor to manufacture the oil will be perfectly successful."

  ; [[.12:110|Cc. Antya 12.110]]
  : When Govinda informed Jagadānanda Paṇḍita of this message, Jagadānanda remained silent, not saying even a word.

  ; [[.12:111|Cc. Antya 12.111]]
  : When ten days had passed, Govinda again told Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "It is the desire of Jagadānanda Paṇḍita that Your Lordship accept the oil."

  ; [[.12:112|Cc. Antya 12.112]]
  : When the Lord heard this, He angrily said, "Why not keep a masseur to massage Me?

  ; [[.12:113|Cc. Antya 12.113]]
  : "Have I taken sannyāsa for such happiness? Accepting this oil would bring My ruination, and all of you would laugh.

  ; [[.12:114|Cc. Antya 12.114]]
  : "If someone passing on the road smelled this oil on My head, he would think Me a dārī sannyāsī, a tantric sannyāsī who keeps women."

  ; [[.12:115|Cc. Antya 12.115]]
  : Hearing these words of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Govinda remained silent. The next morning, Jagadānanda went to see the Lord.

  ; [[.12:116|Cc. Antya 12.116]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said to Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, "My dear Paṇḍita, you have brought Me some oil from Bengal, but since I am in the renounced order, I cannot accept it.

  ; [[.12:117|Cc. Antya 12.117]]
  : "Deliver the oil to the temple of Jagannātha so that it may be burned in the lamps. Thus your labor in preparing the oil will be fruitful."

  ; [[.12:118|Cc. Antya 12.118]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita replied, "Who tells You all these false stories? I never brought any oil from Bengal."

  ; [[.12:119|Cc. Antya 12.119]]
  : After saying this, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita took the jug of oil from the room and threw it down before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in the courtyard and broke it.

  ; [[.12:120|Cc. Antya 12.120]]
  : After breaking the jug, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita returned to his residence, bolted the door and lay down.

  ; [[.12:121|Cc. Antya 12.121]]
  : Three days later, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the door of his room and said, "My dear Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, please get up.

  ; [[.12:122|Cc. Antya 12.122]]
  : "I want you personally to cook My lunch today. I am going now to see the Lord in the temple. I shall return at noon."

  ; [[.12:123|Cc. Antya 12.123]]
  : After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said this and left, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita got up from his bed, bathed, and began to cook varieties of vegetables.

  ; [[.12:124|Cc. Antya 12.124]]
  : After finishing His noontime ritualistic duties, the Lord arrived for lunch. Jagadānanda Paṇḍita washed the Lord's feet and gave the Lord a sitting place.

  ; [[.12:125|Cc. Antya 12.125]]
  : He had cooked fine rice, mixed it with ghee and piled it high on a banana leaf. There were also varieties of vegetables, placed all around in pots made of banana tree bark.

  ; [[.12:126|Cc. Antya 12.126]]
  : On the rice and vegetables were tulasī flowers, and in front of the Lord were cakes, sweet rice and other prasāda of Jagannātha.

  ; [[.12:127|Cc. Antya 12.127]]
  : The Lord said, "Spread another leaf with a helping of rice and vegetables so that today you and I may take lunch together."

  ; [[.12:128|Cc. Antya 12.128]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu kept His hands raised and would not accept the prasāda until Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, with great affection and love, spoke the following words.

  ; [[.12:129|Cc. Antya 12.129]]
  : "Please first take prasāda Yourself, and I shall eat later. I shall not refuse Your request."

  ; [[.12:130|Cc. Antya 12.130]]
  : In great happiness, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then accepted the lunch. When He had tasted the vegetables, He again began to speak.

  ; [[.12:131|Cc. Antya 12.131]]
  : "Even when you cook in an angry mood," He said, "the food is very tasteful. This shows how pleased Kṛṣṇa is with you.

  ; [[.12:132|Cc. Antya 12.132]]
  : "Because He will personally eat the food, Kṛṣṇa makes you cook so nicely.

  ; [[.12:133|Cc. Antya 12.133]]
  : "You offer such nectarean rice to Kṛṣṇa. Who can estimate the limit of your fortune?"

  ; [[.12:134|Cc. Antya 12.134]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita replied, "He who will eat has cooked this. As far as I am concerned, I simply collect the ingredients."

  ; [[.12:135|Cc. Antya 12.135]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita continued to offer the Lord varieties of vegetables. Out of fear, the Lord said nothing, but continued eating happily.

  ; [[.12:136|Cc. Antya 12.136]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita eagerly forced the Lord to eat so much that He ate ten times more than on other days.

  ; [[.12:137|Cc. Antya 12.137]]
  : Again and again when the Lord wished to get up, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita would feed Him more vegetables.

  ; [[.12:138|Cc. Antya 12.138]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu dared not forbid him to feed Him more. He just continued eating, fearful that Jagadānanda would fast if He stopped.

  ; [[.12:139|Cc. Antya 12.139]]
  : At last the Lord respectfully submitted, "My dear Jagadānanda, you have already made Me eat ten times more than I am used to. Now, please stop."

  ; [[.12:140|Cc. Antya 12.140]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stood up and washed His hands and mouth, while Jagadānanda Paṇḍita brought spices, a garland, and sandalwood pulp.

  ; [[.12:141|Cc. Antya 12.141]]
  : Accepting the sandalwood pulp and garland, the Lord sat down and said, "Now, in front of Me, you must eat."

  ; [[.12:142|Cc. Antya 12.142]]
  : Jagadānanda replied, "My Lord, You go take rest. I shall take prasāda after I finish making some arrangements.

  ; [[.12:143|Cc. Antya 12.143]]
  : "Rāmāi Paṇḍita and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa did the cooking, and I want to give them some rice and vegetables."

  ; [[.12:144|Cc. Antya 12.144]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told Govinda, "You remain here. When the Paṇḍita has taken his food, come inform Me.

  ; [[.12:145|Cc. Antya 12.145]]
  : After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had said this and left, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita spoke to Govinda.

  ; [[.12:146|Cc. Antya 12.146]]
  : "Go quickly and massage the Lord's feet," he said. "You may tell Him, 'The Paṇḍita has just sat down to take his meal.'

  ; [[.12:147|Cc. Antya 12.147]]
  : "I shall keep some remnants of the Lord's food for you. When He is asleep, come and take your portion."

  ; [[.12:148|Cc. Antya 12.148]]
  : Jagadānanda Paṇḍita thus distributed remnants of the Lord's food to Rāmāi, Nandāi, Govinda and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa.

  ; [[.12:149|Cc. Antya 12.149]]
  : He also personally ate the remnants of food left by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then the Lord again sent Govinda.

  ; [[.12:150|Cc. Antya 12.150]]
  : The Lord told him, "Go see whether Jagadānanda Paṇḍita is eating. Then quickly return and let Me know."

  ; [[.12:151|Cc. Antya 12.151]]
  : Seeing that Jagadānanda Paṇḍita was indeed eating, Govinda informed the Lord, who then became peaceful and went to sleep.

  ; [[.12:152|Cc. Antya 12.152]]
  : The affectionate loving exchanges between Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued in this manner, exactly like the exchanges between Satyabhāmā and Lord Kṛṣṇa related in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

  ; [[.12:153|Cc. Antya 12.153]]
  : Who can estimate the limit of Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's fortune? He himself is the example of his own great fortune.

  ; [[.12:154|Cc. Antya 12.154]]
  : Anyone who hears about the loving exchanges between Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or who reads Jagadānanda's book Prema-vivarta, can understand what love is. Moreover, he achieves ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.12:155|Cc. Antya 12.155]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
