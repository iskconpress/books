//Ghāṭī// refers to the different toll booths used by the Zamindars to collect taxes in each state. Generally, this tax was collected to maintain the roads governed by the various Zamindars. Since the devotees from Bengal were going to Jagannātha Purī, they had to pass through many such toll booths. Śivānanda Sena was in charge of paying the tolls.
