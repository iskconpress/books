According to Raghunandana Bhaṭṭācārya, the spokesman for the //smārta// regulative principles:

> prātaḥ-snāne vrate śrāddhe
> dvādaśyāṁ grahaṇe tathā
> madya-lepa-samaṁ tailaṁ
> tasmāt tailaṁ vivarjayet

"If one who has taken a vow smears oil on his body while bathing in the morning, while observing a ritualistic ceremony like the //śrāddha// ceremony, or on //dvādaśī// day, he may as well pour wine over his body. Therefore, oil should be rejected." This word //vrata// (vow) is sometimes understood to refer to the //sannyāsa-vrata.// Raghunandana Bhaṭṭācārya has also said in his book //Tithi-tattva://

> ghṛtaṁ ca sārṣapaṁ tailaṁ
> yat tailaṁ puṣpa-vāsitam
> aduṣṭaṁ pakva-tailaṁ ca
> tailābhyaṅge ca nityaśaḥ

This means that clarified butter (//ghee//), mustard oil, floral oil and boiled oil may be used only by //gṛhasthas,// householders.
