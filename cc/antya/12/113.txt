Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu declared Himself a strict //sannyāsī.// A //sannyāsī// is not supposed to take help from anyone. Retaining a masseur to give Him massages would indicate His dependence on others. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to follow very strictly the principle of not accepting anyone's help for His bodily comfort.
