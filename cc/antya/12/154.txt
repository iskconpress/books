===== Translation =====

**Anyone who hears about the loving exchanges between Jagadānanda Paṇḍita and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or who reads Jagadānanda's book Prema-vivarta, can understand what love is. Moreover, he achieves ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.**

===== Purport =====

The word //vivarta// means accepting something to be the opposite of what it appears. Here, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita appeared very angry, but this anger was a manifestation of his great love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Prema-vivarta// is also the name of a book written by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita. Therefore the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, uses the words //prema-vivarta// to refer to one who reads the book or hears about Jagadānanda Paṇḍita's relationships with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In either case, such a person very soon achieves love of Kṛṣṇa.
