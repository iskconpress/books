===== Purport =====

//Puruṣārtha// ("the goal of life") generally refers to religion, economic development, satisfaction of the senses and, finally, liberation. However, above these four kinds of //puruṣārthas,// love of Godhead stands supreme. It is called //parama-puruṣārtha// (the supreme goal of life) or //puruṣārtha-śiromaṇi// (the most exalted of all //puruṣārthas//). Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by regulative devotional service, but the highest perfection of devotional service is spontaneous love of Godhead.
