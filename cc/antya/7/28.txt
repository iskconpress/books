**"The word 'ātma-bhūta' means 'personal associates.' Through the understanding of opulence, the goddess of fortune could not receive the shelter of Kṛṣṇa; the son of Nanda Mahārāja.**

===== Purport =====

Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, has complete knowledge of Kṛṣṇa's opulences, but she could not achieve the association of Kṛṣṇa by dint of such knowledge. The devotees in Vṛndāvana, however, actually enjoy the association of Kṛṣṇa.
