===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not take Vallabha Bhaṭṭa very seriously. Therefore Paṇḍita Gosāñi, or Gadādhara Gosāñi, fell into perplexity. What would be his position if he heard Vallabha Bhaṭṭa's explanation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa's name? Certainly Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would be displeased. Therefore Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosāñi could not make a decision.
