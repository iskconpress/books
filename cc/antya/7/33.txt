{{description>"When mother Yaśodā saw all the universes within the mouth of Kṛṣṇa, she was certainly astonished for the time being. Nevertheless, she still considered the Lord her own son, although He is worshiped by great personalities who offer him sacrifices, great saints who understand the greatness of the Lord by studying the Upaniṣads, great philosophers who analytically study the universe, great yogīs who know him as the all-pervading Supersoul, and even devotees who accept the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.'}}
