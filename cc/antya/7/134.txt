===== Purport =====

//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// has many //ṭīkās,// or commentaries, following the //paramparā// system, but Śrīdhara Svāmī's is first. The commentaries of all the other //ācāryas// follow his. The //paramparā// system does not allow one to deviate from the commentaries of the previous //ācāryas.// By depending upon the previous //ācāryas,// one can write beautiful commentaries. However, one cannot defy the previous //ācāryas.// The false pride that makes one think that he can write better than the previous //ācāryas// will make one's comments faulty. At the present moment it has become fashionable for everyone to write in his own way, but such writing is never accepted by serious devotees. Because of false pride, every scholar and philosopher wants to exhibit his learning by interpreting the //śāstras,// especially //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in his own way. This system of commenting in one's own way is fully condemned by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore He says, //'artha-vyasta' likhana sei.// Commentaries written according to one's own philosophical way are never accepted; no one will appreciate such commentaries on the revealed scriptures.
