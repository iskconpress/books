{{description>"The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to be one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.'}}

This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.47.61) was spoken by Uddhava. When Uddhava was sent by Kṛṣṇa to see the condition of the //gopīs// in Vṛndāvana, he stayed there for a few months in their association and always talked with them about Kṛṣṇa. Although this greatly pleased the //gopīs// and other residents of Vrajabhūmi, Vṛndāvana, Uddhava saw that the //gopīs// were severely afflicted by their separation from Kṛṣṇa. Their hearts were so disturbed that their minds were sometimes deranged. Observing the unalloyed devotion and love of the //gopīs// for Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava desired to become a creeper, a blade of grass or an herb in Vṛndāvana so that sometimes the //gopīs// would trample him and he would receive the dust of their lotus feet on his head.
