~~Title:Cc. Antya 20: The Śikṣāṣṭaka Prayers~~

====== The Śikṣāṣṭaka Prayers ======

The following summary study of the Twentieth Chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed His nights tasting the meaning of //Śikṣāṣṭaka// in the company of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya. Sometimes He recited verses from Jayadeva Gosvāmī's //Gīta-govinda,// from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// from Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya's //jagannātha-vallabha-nāṭaka// or from Śrī Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura's //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.// In this way, He became absorbed in ecstatic emotions. For the twelve years Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived at Jagannātha Purī, He relished the taste of reciting such transcendental verses. The Lord was present in this mortal world for forty-eight years altogether. After hinting about the Lord's disappearance, the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// gives a short description of the entire //Antya-līlā// and then ends his book.

  ; [[.20:1|Cc. Antya 20.1]]
  : Only the most fortunate will relish the mad words of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, which mixed with jubilation, envy, agitation, submissiveness and grief, all produced by ecstatic loving emotions.

  ; [[.20:2|Cc. Antya 20.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Advaitacandra! And all glories to all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[.20:3|Cc. Antya 20.3]]
  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus resided at Jagannātha Purī [Nīlācala], He was continuously overwhelmed, night and day, by separation from Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:4|Cc. Antya 20.4]]
  : Day and night He tasted transcendental blissful songs and verses with two associates, namely Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.20:5|Cc. Antya 20.5]]
  : He relished the symptoms of various transcendental emotions such as jubilation, lamentation, anger, humility, anxiety, grief, eagerness and satisfaction.

  ; [[.20:6|Cc. Antya 20.6]]
  : He would recite His own verses, expressing their meanings and emotions, and thus enjoy tasting them with these two friends.

  ; [[.20:7|Cc. Antya 20.7]]
  : Sometimes the Lord would be absorbed in a particular emotion and would stay awake all night reciting related verses and relishing their taste.

  ; [[.20:8|Cc. Antya 20.8]]
  : In great jubilation, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My dear Svarūpa Dāmodara and Rāmānanda Rāya, know from Me that chanting of the holy names is the most feasible means of salvation in this age of Kali.

  ; [[.20:9|Cc. Antya 20.9]]
  : "In this age of Kali, the process of worshiping Kṛṣṇa is to perform sacrifice by chanting the holy name of the Lord. One who does so is certainly very intelligent, and he attains shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:10|Cc. Antya 20.10]]
  : " 'In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings the name of Kṛṣṇa. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.'

  ; [[.20:11|Cc. Antya 20.11]]
  : "Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one can be freed from all undesirable habits. This is the means of awakening all good fortune and initiating the flow of waves of love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:12|Cc. Antya 20.12]]
  : "Let there be all victory for the chanting of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, which can cleanse the mirror of the heart and stop the miseries of the blazing fire of material existence. That chanting is the waxing moon that spreads the white lotus of good fortune for all living entities. It is the life and soul of all education. The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa expands the blissful ocean of transcendental life. It gives a cooling effect to everyone and enables one to taste full nectar at every step.

  ; [[.20:13|Cc. Antya 20.13]]
  : "By performing congregational chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, one can destroy the sinful condition of material existence, purify the unclean heart and awaken all varieties of devotional service.

  ; [[.20:14|Cc. Antya 20.14]]
  : "The result of chanting is that one awakens his love for Kṛṣṇa and tastes transcendental bliss. Ultimately, one attains the association of Kṛṣṇa and engages in His devotional service, as if immersing himself in a great ocean of love."

  ; [[.20:15|Cc. Antya 20.15]]
  : Lamentation and humility awoke within Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He began reciting another of His own verses. By hearing the meaning of that verse, one can forget all unhappiness and lamentation.

  ; [[.20:16|Cc. Antya 20.16]]
  : "My Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, in Your holy name there is all good fortune for the living entity, and therefore You have many names, such as Kṛṣṇa and Govinda, by which You expand Yourself. You have invested all Your potencies in those names, and there are no hard and fast rules for remembering them. My dear Lord, although You bestow such mercy upon the fallen, conditioned souls by liberally teaching Your holy names, I am so unfortunate that I commit offenses while chanting the holy name, and therefore I do not achieve attachment for chanting.

  ; [[.20:17|Cc. Antya 20.17]]
  : "Because people vary in their desires, You have distributed various holy names by Your mercy.

  ; [[.20:18|Cc. Antya 20.18]]
  : "Regardless of time or place, one who chants the holy name, even while eating or sleeping, attains all perfection.

  ; [[.20:19|Cc. Antya 20.19]]
  : "You have invested Your full potencies in each individual holy name, but I am so unfortunate that I have no attachment for chanting Your holy names."

  ; [[.20:20|Cc. Antya 20.20]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "O Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya, hear from Me the symptoms of how one should chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra to awaken very easily one's dormant love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:21|Cc. Antya 20.21]]
  : "One who thinks himself lower than the grass, who is more tolerant than a tree, and who does not expect personal honor but is always prepared to give all respect to others can very easily always chant the holy name of the Lord.

  ; [[.20:22|Cc. Antya 20.22]]
  : "These are the symptoms of one who chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. Although he is very exalted, he thinks himself lower than the grass on the ground, and like a tree, he tolerates everything in two ways.

  ; [[.20:23|Cc. Antya 20.23]]
  : "When a tree is cut down, it does not protest, and even when drying up, it does not ask anyone for water.

  ; [[.20:24|Cc. Antya 20.24]]
  : "The tree delivers its fruits, flowers and whatever it possesses to anyone and everyone. It tolerates scorching heat and torrents of rain, yet it still gives shelter to others.

  ; [[.20:25|Cc. Antya 20.25]]
  : "Although a Vaiṣṇava is the most exalted person, he is prideless and gives all respect to everyone, knowing everyone to be the resting place of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:26|Cc. Antya 20.26]]
  : "If one chants the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa in this manner, he will certainly awaken his dormant love for Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet."

  ; [[.20:27|Cc. Antya 20.27]]
  : As Lord Caitanya spoke in this way, His humility increased, and He began praying to Kṛṣṇa that He could discharge pure devotional service.

  ; [[.20:28|Cc. Antya 20.28]]
  : Wherever there is a relationship of love of Godhead, its natural symptom is that the devotee does not think himself a devotee. Instead, he always thinks that he has not even a drop of love for Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:29|Cc. Antya 20.29]]
  : "O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to You.

  ; [[.20:30|Cc. Antya 20.30]]
  : "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, I do not want material wealth from You, nor do I want followers, a beautiful wife or the results of fruitive activities. I only pray that by Your causeless mercy You give Me pure devotional service to You, life after life.

  ; [[.20:31|Cc. Antya 20.31]]
  : In great humility, considering Himself a conditioned soul of the material world, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again expressed His desire to be endowed with service to the Lord.

  ; [[.20:32|Cc. Antya 20.32]]
  : "Oh, My Lord, O Kṛṣṇa, son of Mahārāja Nanda, I am Your eternal servant, but because of My own fruitive acts, I have fallen in this horrible ocean of nescience. Now please be causelessly merciful to Me. Consider Me a particle of dust at Your lotus feet.

  ; [[.20:33|Cc. Antya 20.33]]
  : "I am Your eternal servant, but I forgot Your Lordship. Now I have fallen in the ocean of nescience and have been conditioned by the external energy.

  ; [[.20:34|Cc. Antya 20.34]]
  : "Be causelessly merciful to Me by giving Me a place with the particles of dust at Your lotus feet so that I may engage in the service of Your Lordship as Your eternal servant."

  ; [[.20:35|Cc. Antya 20.35]]
  : Natural humility and eagerness then awoke in Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He prayed to Kṛṣṇa to be able to chant the mahā-mantra in ecstatic love.

  ; [[.20:36|Cc. Antya 20.36]]
  : "My dear Lord, when will My eyes be beautified by filling with tears that constantly glide down as I chant Your holy name? When will My voice falter and all the hairs on My body stand erect in transcendental happiness as I chant Your holy name?

  ; [[.20:37|Cc. Antya 20.37]]
  : "Without love of Godhead, My life is useless. Therefore I pray that You accept Me as Your servant and give Me the salary of ecstatic love of God."

  ; [[.20:38|Cc. Antya 20.38]]
  : Separation from Kṛṣṇa awoke various mellows of distress, lamentation and humility. Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spoke like a crazy man.

  ; [[.20:39|Cc. Antya 20.39]]
  : "My Lord Govinda, because of separation from You, I consider even a moment a great millennium. Tears flow from My eyes like torrents of rain, and I see the entire world as void.

  ; [[.20:40|Cc. Antya 20.40]]
  : "In My agitation, a day never ends, for every moment seems like a millennium. Pouring incessant tears, My eyes are like clouds in the rainy season.

  ; [[.20:41|Cc. Antya 20.41]]
  : "The three worlds have become void because of separation from Govinda. I feel as if I were burning alive in a slow fire.

  ; [[.20:42|Cc. Antya 20.42]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa has become indifferent to Me just to test My love, and My friends say,'Better to disregard Him.' "

  ; [[.20:43|Cc. Antya 20.43]]
  : While Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was thinking in this way, the characteristics of natural love became manifest because of Her pure heart.

  ; [[.20:44|Cc. Antya 20.44]]
  : The ecstatic symptoms of envy, great eagerness, humility, zeal and supplication all became manifest at once.

  ; [[.20:45|Cc. Antya 20.45]]
  : In that mood, the mind of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was agitated, and therefore She spoke a verse of advanced devotion to Her gopī friends.

  ; [[.20:46|Cc. Antya 20.46]]
  : In the same spirit of ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recited that verse, and as soon as He did so, He felt like Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

  ; [[.20:47|Cc. Antya 20.47]]
  : "Let Kṛṣṇa tightly embrace this maidservant, who has fallen at His lotus feet. Let Him trample Me or break My heart by never being visible to Me. He is a debauchee, after all, and can do whatever He likes, but He is still no one other than the worshipable Lord of My heart.

  ; [[.20:48|Cc. Antya 20.48]]
  : "I am a maidservant at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. He is the embodiment of transcendental happiness and mellows. If He likes He can tightly embrace Me and make Me feel oneness with Him, or by not giving Me His audience, He may corrode My mind and body. Nevertheless, it is He who is the Lord of My life.

  ; [[.20:49|Cc. Antya 20.49]]
  : "My dear friend, just hear the decision of My mind. Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of My life in all conditions, whether He shows Me affection or kills Me by giving Me unhappiness.

  ; [[.20:50|Cc. Antya 20.50]]
  : "Sometimes Kṛṣṇa gives up the company of other gopīs and becomes controlled, mind and body, by Me. Thus He manifests My good fortune and gives others distress by performing His loving affairs with Me.

  ; [[.20:51|Cc. Antya 20.51]]
  : "Or, since after all He is a very cunning, obstinate debauchee with a propensity to cheat, He takes to the company of other women. He then indulges in loving affairs with them in front of Me to give distress to My mind. Nevertheless, He is still the Lord of My life.

  ; [[.20:52|Cc. Antya 20.52]]
  : "I do not mind My personal distress. I only wish for the happiness of Kṛṣṇa, for His happiness is the goal of My life. However, if He feels great happiness in giving Me distress, that distress is the best of My happiness.

  ; [[.20:53|Cc. Antya 20.53]]
  : "If Kṛṣṇa, attracted by the beauty of some other woman, wants to enjoy with her but is unhappy because He cannot get her, I fall down at her feet, catch her hand and bring her to Kṛṣṇa to engage her for His happiness.

  ; [[.20:54|Cc. Antya 20.54]]
  : "When a beloved gopī shows symptoms of anger toward Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is very satisfied. Indeed, He is pleased when chastised by such a gopī. She shows her pride suitably, and Kṛṣṇa enjoys that attitude. Then she gives up her pride with a little endeavor.

  ; [[.20:55|Cc. Antya 20.55]]
  : "Why does a woman continue to live who knows that Kṛṣṇa's heart is unhappy but who still shows her deep anger toward Him? She is interested in her own happiness. I condemn such a woman to be struck on the head with a thunderbolt, for we simply want the happiness of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.20:56|Cc. Antya 20.56]]
  : "If a gopī envious of Me satisfies Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa desires her, I shall not hesitate to go to her house and become her maidservant, for then My happiness will be awakened.

  ; [[.20:57|Cc. Antya 20.57]]
  : "The wife of a brāhmaṇa suffering from leprosy manifested herself as the topmost of all chaste women by serving a prostitute to satisfy her husband. She thus stopped the movement of the sun, brought her dead husband back to life and satisfied the three principal demigods [Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara].

  ; [[.20:58|Cc. Antya 20.58]]
  : "Kṛṣṇa is My life and soul. Kṛṣṇa is the treasure of My life. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa is the very life of My life. I therefore keep Him always in My heart and try to please Him by rendering service. That is My constant meditation.

  ; [[.20:59|Cc. Antya 20.59]]
  : "My happiness is in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa's happiness is in union with Me. For this reason, I give My body in charity to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, who accepts Me as His loved one and calls Me His most beloved. It is then that I consider Myself His maidservant.

  ; [[.20:60|Cc. Antya 20.60]]
  : "Service to My lover is the home of happiness and is more sweet than direct union with Him. The goddess of fortune is evidence of this, for although she constantly lives on the heart of Nārāyaṇa, she wants to render service to His lotus feet. She therefore considers herself a maidservant and serves Him constantly."

  ; [[.20:61|Cc. Antya 20.61]]
  : These statements by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī show the symptoms of pure love for Kṛṣṇa tasted by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In that ecstatic love, His mind was unsteady. Transformations of transcendental love spread throughout His entire body, and He could not sustain His body and mind.

  ; [[.20:62|Cc. Antya 20.62]]
  : The pure devotional service in Vṛndāvana is like the golden particles in the River Jāmbū. In Vṛndāvana there is not a trace of personal sense gratification. It is to advertise such pure love in this material world that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has written the previous verse and explained its meaning.

  ; [[.20:63|Cc. Antya 20.63]]
  : Thus overwhelmed by ecstatic love, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spoke like a madman and recited suitable verses.

  ; [[.20:64|Cc. Antya 20.64]]
  : The Lord had formerly composed these eight verses to teach people in general. Now He personally tasted the meaning of the verses, which are called the Śikṣāṣṭaka.

  ; [[.20:65|Cc. Antya 20.65]]
  : If anyone recites or hears these eight verses of instruction by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, his ecstatic love and devotion for Kṛṣṇa increase day by day.

  ; [[.20:66|Cc. Antya 20.66]]
  : Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is as deep and grave as millions of oceans, when the moon of His various emotions rises, He becomes restless.

  ; [[.20:67-68|Cc. Antya 20.67-68]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu read the verses of Jayadeva's Gīta-govinda, of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, of Rāmānanda Rāya's drama Jagannātha-vallabha-nāṭaka and of Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura's Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta, He was overwhelmed by the various ecstatic emotions of those verses. Thus He tasted their purports.

  ; [[.20:69|Cc. Antya 20.69]]
  : For twelve years, Śrī Caitanya remained in that state day and night. With His two friends, He tasted the meaning of those verses, which consist of nothing but the transcendental bliss and mellows of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

  ; [[.20:70|Cc. Antya 20.70]]
  : Even Anantadeva, who has thousands of faces, could not reach the end of describing the transcendental bliss of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes.

  ; [[.20:71|Cc. Antya 20.71]]
  : How, then, could an ordinary living being with very little intelligence describe such pastimes? Nevertheless, I am trying to touch but a particle of them just to rectify my own self.

  ; [[.20:72|Cc. Antya 20.72]]
  : There is no limit to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's activities and His words of madness. Therefore describing them all would greatly increase the size of this book.

  ; [[.20:73|Cc. Antya 20.73]]
  : Whatever pastimes Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has first described I have merely summarized.

  ; [[.20:74|Cc. Antya 20.74]]
  : I have only very briefly described the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu not described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Nevertheless, because those transcendental pastimes are so numerous, the size of this book has increased.

  ; [[.20:75|Cc. Antya 20.75]]
  : It is impossible to describe all the pastimes elaborately. I shall therefore end this description and offer them my respectful obeisances.

  ; [[.20:76|Cc. Antya 20.76]]
  : What I have described gives merely an indication, but by following this indication one may obtain a taste of all the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:77|Cc. Antya 20.77]]
  : I cannot understand the very deep, meaningful pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. My intelligence cannot penetrate them, and therefore I could not properly describe them.

  ; [[.20:78|Cc. Antya 20.78]]
  : After offering my respectful obeisances to the lotus feet of all my Vaiṣṇava readers, I shall therefore end this description of the characteristics of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:79|Cc. Antya 20.79]]
  : The sky is unlimited, but many birds fly higher and higher according to their own abilities.

  ; [[.20:80|Cc. Antya 20.80]]
  : The pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are like the unlimited sky. How, then, can an ordinary living being describe them all?

  ; [[.20:81|Cc. Antya 20.81]]
  : I have tried to describe them as far as my intelligence allows, as if trying to touch a drop in the midst of a great ocean.

  ; [[.20:82|Cc. Antya 20.82]]
  : Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura is Lord Nityānanda's favorite devotee, and therefore he is the original Vyāsadeva in describing the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:83|Cc. Antya 20.83]]
  : Although Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has within his jurisdiction the full store of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes, he has left aside most of them and described but a small portion.

  ; [[.20:84|Cc. Antya 20.84]]
  : What I have described was left aside by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, but although he could not describe these pastimes, he gave us a synopsis.

  ; [[.20:85|Cc. Antya 20.85]]
  : In his book named Caitanya-maṅgala [Caitanya-bhāgavata], he has described these pastimes in many places. I request my readers to hear that book, for that is the best evidence.

  ; [[.20:86|Cc. Antya 20.86]]
  : I have described the pastimes very briefly, for it is impossible for me to describe them in full. In the future, however, Vedavyāsa will describe them elaborately.

  ; [[.20:87|Cc. Antya 20.87]]
  : In Caitanya-maṅgala, Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has stated in many places the factual truth that in the future Vyāsadeva will describe them elaborately.

  ; [[.20:88|Cc. Antya 20.88]]
  : The ocean of nectarean pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is like the ocean of milk. According to his thirst, Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura filled his pitcher and drank from that ocean.

  ; [[.20:89|Cc. Antya 20.89]]
  : Whatever remnants of milk Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has given me are sufficient to fill my belly. Now my thirst is completely satiated.

  ; [[.20:90-91|Cc. Antya 20.90-91]]
  : I am a very insignificant living being, like a small red-beaked bird. Just as such a bird drinks the water of the sea to quench its thirst, so I have touched only a drop of the ocean of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes. From this example, you may all understand how expansive are the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:92|Cc. Antya 20.92]]
  : I infer that "I have written" is a false understanding, for my body is like a wooden doll.

  ; [[.20:93|Cc. Antya 20.93]]
  : I am old and troubled by invalidity. I am almost blind and deaf, my hands tremble, and my mind and intelligence are unsteady.

  ; [[.20:94|Cc. Antya 20.94]]
  : I am infected by so many diseases that I can neither properly walk nor properly sit. Indeed, I am always exhausted by five kinds of disease. I may die at any time of the day or night.

  ; [[.20:95|Cc. Antya 20.95]]
  : I have previously given an account of my inabilities. Please hear the reason why I nevertheless still write.

  ; [[.20:96-98|Cc. Antya 20.96-98]]
  : I am writing this book by the mercy of the lotus feet of Śrī Govindadeva, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Nityānanda, Advaita Ācārya, other devotees and the readers of this book, as well as Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, who is my spiritual master, and Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī. I have also been specifically favored by another Supreme Personality.

  ; [[.20:99|Cc. Antya 20.99]]
  : Śrī Madana-mohana Deity of Vṛndāvana has given the order that is making me write. Although this should not be disclosed, I disclose it because I am unable to remain silent.

  ; [[.20:100|Cc. Antya 20.100]]
  : If I did not disclose this fact, I would be guilty of ingratitude to the Lord. Therefore, my dear readers, please do not consider me too proud and be angry at me.

  ; [[.20:101|Cc. Antya 20.101]]
  : It is because I have offered my prayers unto the lotus feet of all of you that whatever I have written about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has been possible.

  ; [[.20:102|Cc. Antya 20.102]]
  : Now let me repeat all the pastimes of the Antya-līlā, for if I do so I shall taste the pastimes again.

  ; [[.20:103|Cc. Antya 20.103]]
  : The First Chapter describes how Rūpa Gosvāmī met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for the second time and how the Lord heard his two dramas [Vidagdha-mādhava and Lalita-mādhava].

  ; [[.20:104|Cc. Antya 20.104]]
  : That chapter also describes the incident of Śivānanda Sena's dog, who was induced by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and was thus liberated.

  ; [[.20:105|Cc. Antya 20.105]]
  : In the Second Chapter the Lord instructively punished Junior Haridāsa. Also in that chapter is the wonderful vision of Śivānanda Sena.

  ; [[.20:106|Cc. Antya 20.106]]
  : In the Third Chapter is a description of the forceful glories of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. That chapter also mentions how Dāmodara Paṇḍita spoke words of criticism to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:107|Cc. Antya 20.107]]
  : The Third Chapter also tells how Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered everyone by bestowing upon the universe the holy name of the Lord, and it describes how Haridāsa Ṭhākura established the glories of the holy name by his practical example.

  ; [[.20:108|Cc. Antya 20.108]]
  : The Fourth Chapter describes Sanātana Gosvāmī's second visit with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and how the Lord saved him from committing suicide.

  ; [[.20:109|Cc. Antya 20.109]]
  : The Fourth Chapter also tells how Sanātana Gosvāmī was tested in the sunshine of Jyaiṣṭha [May and June] and was then empowered and sent back to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.20:110|Cc. Antya 20.110]]
  : In the Fifth Chapter, the Lord showed His favor to Pradyumna Miśra and made him hear topics of Kṛṣṇa from Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.20:111|Cc. Antya 20.111]]
