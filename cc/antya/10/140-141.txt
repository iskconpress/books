**They would extend invitations to the Lord. Vāsudeva Datta, Gadādhara dāsa, Murāri Gupta, the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma and Khaṇḍa and many other devotees who were not brāhmaṇas by caste would purchase food offered to Lord Jagannātha and then extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.**

===== Purport =====

The inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma, such as Satyarāja Khān and Rāmānanda Vasu, were not //brāhmaṇas// by caste, nor were the inhabitants of Khaṇḍa, such as Mukunda dāsa, Narahari dāsa and Raghunandana. Therefore they would purchase //prasāda// from the market where the remnants of Lord Jagannātha's food was sold and then extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whereas Ācāryaratna, Ācāryanidhi and others who were //brāhmaṇas// by caste would cook at home when they invited the Lord. Caitanya Mahāprabhu observed the etiquette then current in society by accepting only //prasāda// cooked by members of the //brāhmaṇa// caste, but on principle He accepted invitations from His devotees, regardless of whether they were //brāhmaṇas// by caste.
