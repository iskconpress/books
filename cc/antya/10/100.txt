===== Purport =====

//Karmīs,// fruitive workers, cannot understand the finer conclusions of devotional service because they accept only its ritualistic value but do not understand how devotional service satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //karmīs// view the formalities as a means of advancing in religion, economic development, sensual satisfaction and liberation. Although these are only material results of following religious principles, the //karmīs// consider them everything. Such ritualistic activities are called //karma. Karmīs// who adopt devotional service very loosely and who therefore remain on the platform of material activities are called //prākṛta-sahajiyās.// They cannot understand how pure devotional service is rendered in paternal and conjugal love, for this can be understood only by the special mercy bestowed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu upon pure devotees.
