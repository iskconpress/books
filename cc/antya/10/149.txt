**PURPORT**

By the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Caitanya dāsa understood the Lord's mind. Therefore he arranged for food that would counteract the heavy meal the Lord had eaten the previous day.

Later in life, Caitanya dāsa became a very learned Sanskrit scholar and wrote many books. Among these books, his commentary on //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// is very famous. There is another book called //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// which is a work of Sanskrit poetry. It is said that this was also composed by him.
