===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa is very pleased with His devotees and their offerings. Therefore in //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord says:

> patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
> yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
> tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam
> aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ

"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]] Herein also we find that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted all this food because it had been offered by His devotees. Sometimes He would eat it during lunch and sometimes at night, but He would always think that since His devotees had offered it with great love and affection, He must eat it.
