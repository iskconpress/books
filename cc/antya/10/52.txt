===== Purport =====

The Deity referred to herein as Govinda is the //vijaya-vigraha// in the temple of Jagannātha. When there is a need to take Jagannātha somewhere, the //vijaya-vigraha// is taken because the body of Jagannātha is very heavy. The //vijaya-vigraha// in the Jagannātha temple is known as Govinda. For the pastimes in the Narendrasarovara, the //vijaya-vigraha// was carried there instead of Lord Jagannātha.
