~~Title:Cc. Antya 10: Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Accepts Prasāda from the Devotees~~

====== Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Accepts Prasāda from the Devotees ======

The following summary of Chapter Ten is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// Before the Ratha-yātrā ceremony, all the devotees from Bengal started for Jagannātha Purī as usual. Rāghava Paṇḍita brought with him various kinds of food for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The food had been cooked by his sister, whose name was Damayantī, and the stock was generally known as //rāghavera jhāli.// Makaradhvaja Kara, an inhabitant of Pānihāṭi who accompanied Rāghava Paṇḍita, was the secretary in charge of accounting for the //rāghavera jhāli,// the bags of food carried by Rāghava Paṇḍita.

The day when all the devotees arrived at Jagannātha Purī, Lord Govinda was enjoying sporting pastimes in the water of Narendra-sarovara. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also enjoyed the ceremony in the water with His devotees. As previously, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed the cleansing ceremony at Guṇḍicā and chanted the famous verse //jagamohana-pari-muṇḍā yāu.// After //kīrtana// ended, He distributed //prasāda// to all the devotees and also took some Himself. Then He lay down at the door of the Gambhīrā to take rest. Somehow or other Govinda came by and massaged His feet. Govinda could not go out that day, however, and therefore he was unable to accept //prasāda.// From the character of Govinda it is to be learned that we may sometimes commit offenses for the service of the Lord, but not for sense gratification.

Govinda, the personal servant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, induced the Lord to eat all the food delivered by the devotees of Bengal for His service. All the Vaiṣṇavas used to invite Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to their homes. The Lord accepted the invitation of Caitanya dāsa, the son of Śivānanda Sena, and ate rice and yogurt there.

  ; [[.10:1|Cc. Antya 10.1]]
  : Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is always pleased to accept anything given with faith and love by His devotees and is always ready to bestow mercy upon them.

  ; [[.10:2|Cc. Antya 10.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaitacandra! All glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.10:3|Cc. Antya 10.3]]
  : The next year, all the devotees were very pleased to go to Jagannātha Purī [Nīlācala] to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:4|Cc. Antya 10.4]]
  : Advaita Ācārya Gosāñi led the party from Bengal. He was followed by Ācāryaratna, Ācāryanidhi, Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura and other glorious devotees.

  ; [[.10:5|Cc. Antya 10.5]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had ordered Lord Nityānanda to stay in Bengal, but nevertheless, because of ecstatic love, Lord Nityānanda also went to see Him.

  ; [[.10:6|Cc. Antya 10.6]]
  : Indeed, it is a symptom of real affection that one breaks the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not caring for the regulative principles, to associate with Him.

  ; [[.10:7|Cc. Antya 10.7]]
  : During the rāsa dance, Kṛṣṇa asked all the gopīs to return home, but the gopīs neglected His order and stayed there for His association.

  ; [[.10:8|Cc. Antya 10.8]]
  : If one carries out Kṛṣṇa's order, Kṛṣṇa is certainly pleased, but if one sometimes breaks His order due to ecstatic love, that gives Him millions of times greater happiness.

  ; [[.10:9-11|Cc. Antya 10.9-11]]
  : Vāsudeva Datta, Murāri Gupta, Gaṅgādāsa, Śrīmān Sena, Śrīmān Paṇḍita, Akiñcana Kṛṣṇadāsa, Murāri Gupta, Garuḍa Paṇḍita, Buddhimanta Khān, Sañjaya Puruṣottama, Bhagavān Paṇḍita, Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī, Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī and many others joined together to go to Jagannātha Purī. It would be impossible to mention the names of them all.

  ; [[.10:12|Cc. Antya 10.12]]
  : The inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma and Khaṇḍa also came and joined. Śivānanda Sena took the leadership and thus started taking care of them all.

  ; [[.10:13|Cc. Antya 10.13]]
  : Rāghava Paṇḍita came with bags full of food prepared very nicely by his sister, Damayantī.

  ; [[.10:14|Cc. Antya 10.14]]
  : Damayantī made varieties of unparalleled food just suitable for Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to eat. The Lord ate it continually for one year.

  ; [[.10:15-16|Cc. Antya 10.15-16]]
  : These are the names of some of the pickles and condiments in the bags of Rāghava Paṇḍita: āmra-kāśandi, ādā-kāśandi, jhāla-kāśandi, nembu-ādā, āmra-koli, āmsi, āma-khaṇḍa, tailāmra and āma-sattā. With great attention, Damayantī also made dried bitter vegetables into a powder.

  ; [[.10:17|Cc. Antya 10.17]]
  : Do not neglect sukutā because it is a bitter preparation. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu derived more happiness from eating this sukutā than from drinking pañcāmṛta [a preparation of milk, sugar, ghee, honey and curd].

  ; [[.10:18|Cc. Antya 10.18]]
  : Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He extracts the purpose from everything. He accepted Damayantī's affection for Him, and therefore He derived great pleasure even from the dried bitter leaves of sukutā and from kāśandi [a sour condiment].

  ; [[.10:19|Cc. Antya 10.19]]
  : Because of her natural love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Damayantī considered the Lord an ordinary human being. Therefore she thought that He would become sick by overeating and there would be mucus within His abdomen.

  ; [[.10:20|Cc. Antya 10.20]]
  : Because of sincere affection, she thought that eating this sukutā would cure the Lord's disease. Considering these affectionate thoughts of Damayantī, the Lord was very pleased.

  ; [[.10:21|Cc. Antya 10.21]]
  : "A dear lover strung a garland and placed it on the shoulder of his beloved in the presence of her co-wives. She had raised breasts and was very beautiful, yet although the garland was tainted with mud, she did not reject it, for its value lay not in material things but in love."

  ; [[.10:22|Cc. Antya 10.22]]
  : Damayantī powdered coriander and anise seeds, cooked them with sugar and made them into small sweetmeats that were shaped like small balls.

  ; [[.10:23|Cc. Antya 10.23]]
  : She made balls of sweetmeats with dried ginger to remove mucus caused by too much bile. She put all these preparations separately into small cloth bags.

  ; [[.10:24|Cc. Antya 10.24]]
  : She made a hundred varieties of condiments and pickles. She also made koli-śuṇṭhi, koli-cūrṇa, koli-khaṇḍa and many other preparations. How many should I name?

  ; [[.10:25|Cc. Antya 10.25]]
  : She made many sweetmeats shaped like balls. Some were made with powdered coconut, and others looked as white as the water of the Ganges. In this way she made many varieties of long-lasting sugar confections.

  ; [[.10:26|Cc. Antya 10.26]]
  : She made long-lasting cheese, many varieties of sweetmeats with milk and cream, and many other varied preparations, such as amṛta-karpūra.

  ; [[.10:27|Cc. Antya 10.27]]
  : She made flat rice from fine, unboiled, śāli paddy and filled a large bag made of new cloth.

  ; [[.10:28|Cc. Antya 10.28]]
  : She made some of the flat rice into puffed rice, fried it in ghee, cooked it in sugar juice, mixed in some camphor and rolled it into balls.

  ; [[.10:29-30|Cc. Antya 10.29-30]]
  : She powdered fried grains of fine rice, moistened the powder with ghee and cooked it in a solution of sugar. Then she added camphor, black pepper, cloves, cardamom and other spices and rolled it into balls that were very palatable and aromatic.

  ; [[.10:31|Cc. Antya 10.31]]
  : She took parched rice from fine paddy, fried it in ghee, cooked it in a sugar solution, mixed in some camphor and thus made a preparation called ukhḍā or muḍki.

  ; [[.10:32|Cc. Antya 10.32]]
  : Another variety of sweet was made with fused peas that were powdered, fried in ghee and then cooked in sugar juice. Camphor was mixed in, and then the sweet was rolled into a ball.

  ; [[.10:33|Cc. Antya 10.33]]
  : I could not mention the names of all these wonderful eatables, even in a lifetime. Damayantī made hundreds and thousands of varieties.

  ; [[.10:34|Cc. Antya 10.34]]
  : Damayantī made all these preparations following the order of her brother, Rāghava Paṇḍita. Both of them had unlimited affection for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and were advanced in devotional service.

  ; [[.10:35|Cc. Antya 10.35]]
  : Damayantī took earth from the Ganges, dried it, powdered it, strained it through a fine cloth, mixed in aromatic ingredients and rolled it into small balls.

  ; [[.10:36|Cc. Antya 10.36]]
  : The condiments and similar items were put into thin earthen pots, and everything else was put into small cloth bags.

  ; [[.10:37|Cc. Antya 10.37]]
  : From small bags Damayantī made bags that were twice as large. Then with great attention she filled all the large ones with the small ones.

  ; [[.10:38|Cc. Antya 10.38]]
  : She then wrapped and sealed each and every bag with great attention. The bags were carried by three bearers, one after another.

  ; [[.10:39|Cc. Antya 10.39]]
  : Thus I have briefly described the bags that have become famous as rāghavera jhāli.

  ; [[.10:40|Cc. Antya 10.40]]
  : The superintendent for all those bags was Makaradhvaja Kara, who kept them with great attention like his very life.

  ; [[.10:41|Cc. Antya 10.41]]
  : Thus all the Vaiṣṇavas from Bengal went to Jagannātha Purī. By chance, they arrived on the day when Lord Jagannātha performs pastimes in the water.

  ; [[.10:42|Cc. Antya 10.42]]
  : Boarding a boat in the waters of Narendra-sarovara, Lord Govinda performed His water pastimes with all the devotees.

  ; [[.10:43|Cc. Antya 10.43]]
  : Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived with His personal associates to see the jubilant pastimes of Lord Jagannātha in the Narendra-sarovara.

  ; [[.10:44|Cc. Antya 10.44]]
  : At the same time, all the devotees from Bengal arrived at the lake and had a great meeting with the Lord.

  ; [[.10:45|Cc. Antya 10.45]]
  : All the devotees immediately fell at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Lord lifted and embraced every one of them.

  ; [[.10:46|Cc. Antya 10.46]]
  : The Gauḍīya-sampradāya, consisting of all the devotees from Bengal, began congregational chanting. When they met the Lord, they began to cry loudly in ecstatic love.

  ; [[.10:47|Cc. Antya 10.47]]
  : Because of the pastimes in the water, there was great jubilation on the shore, with music, singing, chanting, dancing and tumultuous crying.

  ; [[.10:48|Cc. Antya 10.48]]
  : The chanting and crying of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas mixed and created a tumultuous sound vibration that filled the entire universe.

  ; [[.10:49|Cc. Antya 10.49]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the water with His devotees and began His pastimes with them in great jubilation.

  ; [[.10:50|Cc. Antya 10.50]]
  : In his Caitanya-maṅgala [now known as Caitanya-bhāgavata], Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has given a detailed description of the activities the Lord performed in the water.

  ; [[.10:51|Cc. Antya 10.51]]
  : There is no use describing here the activities of the Lord again. It would simply be repetitious and would increase the size of this book.

  ; [[.10:52|Cc. Antya 10.52]]
  : After concluding His pastimes in the water, Lord Govinda returned to His residence. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the temple, taking all His devotees with Him.

  ; [[.10:53|Cc. Antya 10.53]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to His residence after visiting the temple of Jagannātha, He asked for a large quantity of Lord Jagannātha's prasāda, which He then distributed among His devotees so that they could eat sumptuously.

  ; [[.10:54|Cc. Antya 10.54]]
  : After talking with all the devotees for some time, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked them to occupy the individual residences in which they had lived the previous year.

  ; [[.10:55|Cc. Antya 10.55]]
  : Rāghava Paṇḍita delivered the bags of eatables to Govinda, who kept them in a corner of the dining room.

  ; [[.10:56|Cc. Antya 10.56]]
  : Govinda thoroughly emptied the bags from the previous year and kept them in another room to fill them with other goods.

  ; [[.10:57|Cc. Antya 10.57]]
  : The next day, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went with His personal devotees to see Lord Jagannātha when Lord Jagannātha arose early in the morning.

  ; [[.10:58|Cc. Antya 10.58]]
  : After seeing Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began His all-encompassing saṅkīrtana. He formed seven groups, which then began to chant.

  ; [[.10:59|Cc. Antya 10.59]]
  : In each of the seven groups was a principal dancer like Advaita Ācārya and Lord Nityānanda.

  ; [[.10:60|Cc. Antya 10.60]]
  : The dancers in the other groups were Vakreśvara Paṇḍita, Acyutānanda, Paṇḍita Śrīvāsa, Satyarāja Khān and Narahari dāsa.

  ; [[.10:61|Cc. Antya 10.61]]
  : As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu walked from one group to another inspecting them, the men in each group thought, "The Lord is within our group."

  ; [[.10:62|Cc. Antya 10.62]]
  : The congregational chanting made a tumultuous roar that filled the sky. All the inhabitants of Jagannātha Purī came to see the kīrtana.

  ; [[.10:63|Cc. Antya 10.63]]
  : Accompanied by his personal staff, the King also came there and watched from a distance, and all the queens watched from the elevated parts of the palace.

  ; [[.10:64|Cc. Antya 10.64]]
  : Due to the forceful vibration of kīrtana, the entire world began trembling. When everyone chanted the holy name, they made a tumultuous sound.

  ; [[.10:65|Cc. Antya 10.65]]
  : In this way the Lord had congregational chanting performed for some time, and then He Himself desired to dance.

  ; [[.10:66|Cc. Antya 10.66]]
  : The seven groups began chanting and beating their drums in seven directions, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began dancing in the center in great ecstatic love.

  ; [[.10:67|Cc. Antya 10.67]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remembered a line in the Orissan language and ordered Svarūpa Dāmodara to sing it.

  ; [[.10:68|Cc. Antya 10.68]]
  : "Let my head fall at the feet of Jagannātha in the kīrtana hall known as Jagamohana."

  ; [[.10:69|Cc. Antya 10.69]]
  : Simply because of this line, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was dancing in greatly ecstatic love. People all around Him floated in the water of His tears.

  ; [[.10:70|Cc. Antya 10.70]]
  : Raising His two arms, the Lord said, "Chant! Chant!" Floating in transcendental bliss, the people responded by chanting the holy name of Hari.

  ; [[.10:71|Cc. Antya 10.71]]
  : The Lord fell to the ground unconscious, not even breathing. Then suddenly He stood up, making a loud sound.

  ; [[.10:72|Cc. Antya 10.72]]
  : The hairs on His body constantly stood up like the thorns on a śimula tree. Sometimes His body was swollen and sometimes lean and thin.

  ; [[.10:73|Cc. Antya 10.73]]
  : He bled and perspired from every pore of His body. His voice faltered. Unable to say the line properly, He uttered only, "jaja gaga pari mumu."

  ; [[.10:74|Cc. Antya 10.74]]
  : All His teeth shook, as if each were separate from the others. Indeed, they seemed about to fall to the ground.

  ; [[.10:75|Cc. Antya 10.75]]
  : His transcendental bliss increased at every moment. Therefore even by midafternoon the dancing had not ended.

  ; [[.10:76|Cc. Antya 10.76]]
  : The ocean of transcendental bliss overflowed, and everyone present forgot his body, mind and home.

  ; [[.10:77|Cc. Antya 10.77]]
  : Then Lord Nityānanda found a way to end the kīrtana. He gradually stopped all the chanters.

  ; [[.10:78|Cc. Antya 10.78]]
  : Thus only one group continued chanting with Svarūpa Dāmodara, and they chanted very softly.

  ; [[.10:79|Cc. Antya 10.79]]
  : When there was no longer a tumultuous sound, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to consciousness. Then Nityānanda Prabhu informed Him of the fatigue of the chanters and dancers.

  ; [[.10:80|Cc. Antya 10.80]]
  : Understanding the fatigue of the devotees, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stopped the congregational chanting. Then He bathed in the sea, accompanied by them all.

  ; [[.10:81|Cc. Antya 10.81]]
  : Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took prasāda with all of them and then asked them to return to their dwellings and take rest.

  ; [[.10:82|Cc. Antya 10.82]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lay down at the door of the Gambhīrā, and Govinda came there to massage His legs.

  ; [[.10:83-84|Cc. Antya 10.83-84]]
  : It was a steady, long-standing rule that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would lie down to rest after lunch and Govinda would come to massage His legs. Then Govinda would honor the remnants of food left by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:85|Cc. Antya 10.85]]
  : This time when the Lord lay down, He occupied the entire doorway. Govinda could not enter the room, and therefore he made the following request.

  ; [[.10:86|Cc. Antya 10.86]]
  : "Kindly turn on one side. Let me pass to enter the room." However, the Lord replied, "I don't have the strength to move My body."

  ; [[.10:87|Cc. Antya 10.87]]
  : Govinda made his request again and again, but the Lord replied, "I cannot move My body."

  ; [[.10:88|Cc. Antya 10.88]]
  : Govinda repeatedly requested, "I want to massage Your legs," but the Lord said, "Do it or don't do it. It depends upon your mind."

  ; [[.10:89|Cc. Antya 10.89]]
  : Then Govinda spread the Lord's wrapper over the Lord's body and in this way entered the room by crossing over Him.

  ; [[.10:90|Cc. Antya 10.90]]
  : Govinda massaged the Lord's legs as usual. He pressed the Lord's waist and back very softly, and thus all the Lord's fatigue went away.

  ; [[.10:91|Cc. Antya 10.91]]
  : As Govinda stroked His body, the Lord slept very nicely for about forty-five minutes, and then His sleep broke.

  ; [[.10:92|Cc. Antya 10.92]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw Govinda sitting by His side, He was somewhat angry."Why have you been sitting here for so long today?" the Lord asked.

  ; [[.10:93|Cc. Antya 10.93]]
  : "Why didn't you go to take your meal after I fell asleep?" the Lord asked. Govinda replied, "You were lying down, blocking the door, and there was no way to go."

  ; [[.10:94|Cc. Antya 10.94]]
  : The Lord asked, "How did you enter the room? Why didn't you go out to take your lunch in the same way?"

  ; [[.10:95|Cc. Antya 10.95]]
  : Govinda mentally replied, "My duty is to serve, even if I have to commit offenses or go to hell.

  ; [[.10:96|Cc. Antya 10.96]]
  : "I would not mind committing hundreds and thousands of offenses for the service of the Lord, but I greatly fear committing even a glimpse of an offense for my own self."

  ; [[.10:97|Cc. Antya 10.97]]
  : Thinking in this way, Govinda kept silent. He did not reply to the Lord's inquiry.

  ; [[.10:98|Cc. Antya 10.98]]
  : It was Govinda's practice to go take lunch when the Lord was asleep. On that day, however, seeing the Lord's weariness, Govinda continued massaging His body.

  ; [[.10:99|Cc. Antya 10.99]]
  : There was no way to go. How could he leave? When he thought of crossing over the Lord's body, he considered it a great offense.

  ; [[.10:100|Cc. Antya 10.100]]
  : These are some of the finer points of etiquette in devotional service. Only one who has received the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu can understand these principles.

  ; [[.10:101|Cc. Antya 10.101]]
  : The Lord is very interested in manifesting the exalted qualities of His devotees, and that is why He engineered this incident.

  ; [[.10:102|Cc. Antya 10.102]]
  : Thus I have briefly described Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's dancing in the hall of the Jagannātha temple. The servants of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sing about this dancing even now.

  ; [[.10:103|Cc. Antya 10.103]]
  : Accompanied by His personal associates, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu washed and swept the Guṇḍicā temple, cleansing it as usual.

  ; [[.10:104|Cc. Antya 10.104]]
  : The Lord danced and chanted and then enjoyed a picnic in the garden as He had done before.

  ; [[.10:105|Cc. Antya 10.105]]
  : As previously, He danced in front of the Jagannātha cart and observed the festival of Herā-pañcamī.

  ; [[.10:106|Cc. Antya 10.106]]
  : All the devotees from Bengal stayed in Jagannātha Purī for the four months of the rainy season and observed many other ceremonies, such as the anniversary of Lord Kṛṣṇa's birth.

  ; [[.10:107|Cc. Antya 10.107]]
  : Formerly, when all the devotees had arrived from Bengal, they all desired to give Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu something to eat.

  ; [[.10:108|Cc. Antya 10.108]]
  : Each devotee would bring a certain type of prasāda. He would entrust it to Govinda and request him, "Please arrange that the Lord will surely eat this prasāda."

  ; [[.10:109|Cc. Antya 10.109]]
  : Some brought paiḍa [a coconut preparation], some brought sweetballs, and some brought cakes and sweet rice. The prasāda was of different varieties, all very costly.

  ; [[.10:110|Cc. Antya 10.110]]
  : Govinda would present the prasāda and say to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "This has been given by such and such devotee." The Lord, however, would not actually eat it. He would simply say, "Keep it in storage."

  ; [[.10:111|Cc. Antya 10.111]]
  : Govinda kept accumulating the food, and soon it filled a corner of the room. There was quite enough to feed at least a hundred people.

  ; [[.10:112|Cc. Antya 10.112]]
  : All the devotees asked Govinda with great eagerness, "Have you given Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu the prasāda brought by me?"

  ; [[.10:113|Cc. Antya 10.113]]
  : When the devotees questioned Govinda, he had to tell them lies. Therefore one day he spoke to the Lord in disappointment.

  ; [[.10:114|Cc. Antya 10.114]]
  : "Many respectable devotees, headed by Advaita Ācārya, make a great endeavor to entrust me with varieties of food for You.

  ; [[.10:115|Cc. Antya 10.115]]
  : "You do not eat it, but they ask me again and again. How long shall I go on cheating them? How shall I be freed from this responsibility?"

  ; [[.10:116|Cc. Antya 10.116]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Why are you so foolishly unhappy? Bring here to Me whatever they have given you."

  ; [[.10:117|Cc. Antya 10.117]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down to eat. Then Govinda offered Him the preparations one after another, and as he did so he spoke the name of the person who had given each one.

  ; [[.10:118|Cc. Antya 10.118]]
  : "These preparations-paiḍa, sweet rice, cakes made with cream, and also amṛta-guṭikā, maṇḍā and a pot of camphor-have been given by Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.10:119|Cc. Antya 10.119]]
  : "Next there are varieties of food-cakes, cream, amṛta-maṇḍā and padmacini-given by Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita.

  ; [[.10:120|Cc. Antya 10.120]]
  : "All these are gifts of Ācāryaratna, and these varieties of gifts are from Ācāryanidhi.

  ; [[.10:121|Cc. Antya 10.121]]
  : "And all these varieties of food have been given by Vāsudeva Datta, Murāri Gupta and Buddhimanta Khān.

  ; [[.10:122|Cc. Antya 10.122]]
  : "These are gifts given by Śrīmān Sena, Śrīmān Paṇḍita and Ācārya Nandana. Please eat them all.

  ; [[.10:123|Cc. Antya 10.123]]
  : "Here are the preparations made by the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma, and these have been made by the inhabitants of Khaṇḍa."

  ; [[.10:124|Cc. Antya 10.124]]
  : In this way, Govinda gave everyone's name as he put the food before the Lord. Being very satisfied, the Lord began to eat it all.

  ; [[.10:125-126|Cc. Antya 10.125-126]]
  : The hard sweets made of coconut, mukuta nārikela, the sweetballs, the many kinds of sweet drinks and all the other preparations were at least a month old, but although they were old, they had not become tasteless or stale. Indeed, they had all stayed fresh. That is the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:127|Cc. Antya 10.127]]
  : Within a very short time, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate enough for a hundred people. Then He asked Govinda, "Is there anything more left?"

  ; [[.10:128|Cc. Antya 10.128]]
  : Govinda replied, "Now there are only the bags of Rāghava." The Lord said, "Let them remain today. I shall see them later."

  ; [[.10:129|Cc. Antya 10.129]]
  : The next day, while taking His lunch in a secluded place, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu opened the bags of Rāghava and inspected their contents one after another.

  ; [[.10:130|Cc. Antya 10.130]]
  : He tasted a little of everything they contained and praised it all for its flavor and aroma.

  ; [[.10:131|Cc. Antya 10.131]]
  : All the varieties of the remaining prasāda were kept to eat throughout the year. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate His lunch, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī would serve it little by little.

  ; [[.10:132|Cc. Antya 10.132]]
  : Sometimes Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would take some of it at night. The Lord certainly enjoys preparations made with faith and love by His devotees.

  ; [[.10:133|Cc. Antya 10.133]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spent the entire period of Cāturmāsya [the four months of the rainy season] in the happiness of discussing topics of Kṛṣṇa with His devotees.

  ; [[.10:134|Cc. Antya 10.134]]
  : From time to time, Advaita Ācārya and others would invite Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for home-cooked rice and varieties of vegetables.

  ; [[.10:135-136|Cc. Antya 10.135-136]]
  : They offered pungent preparations made with black pepper, sweet-and-sour preparations, ginger, salty preparations, limes, milk, yogurt, cheese, two or four kinds of spinach, soup made with bitter melon, eggplant mixed with nimba flowers, and fried paṭola.

  ; [[.10:137|Cc. Antya 10.137]]
  : They also offered phula-baḍī, liquid mung dhal and many vegetables, all cooked according to the Lord's taste.

  ; [[.10:138|Cc. Antya 10.138]]
  : They would mix these preparations with the remnants of food from Lord Jagannātha. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the invitations, He went sometimes alone and sometimes with His associates.

  ; [[.10:139|Cc. Antya 10.139]]
  : Devotees like Ācāryaratna, Ācāryanidhi, Nandana Ācārya, Rāghava Paṇḍita and Śrīvāsa were all of the brāhmaṇa caste.

  ; [[.10:140-141|Cc. Antya 10.140-141]]
  : They would extend invitations to the Lord. Vāsudeva Datta, Gadādhara dāsa, Murāri Gupta, the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma and Khaṇḍa and many other devotees who were not brāhmaṇas by caste would purchase food offered to Lord Jagannātha and then extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:142|Cc. Antya 10.142]]
  : Now hear about the invitation Śivānanda Sena extended to the Lord. His eldest son was named Caitanya dāsa.

  ; [[.10:143|Cc. Antya 10.143]]
  : When Śivānanda brought his son, Caitanya dāsa, to be introduced to the Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired about his name.

  ; [[.10:144|Cc. Antya 10.144]]
  : When the Lord heard that his name was Caitanya dāsa, He said, "What kind of name have you given him? It is very difficult to understand."

  ; [[.10:145|Cc. Antya 10.145]]
  : Śivānanda Sena replied, "He has kept the name that appeared to me from within." Then he invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for lunch.

  ; [[.10:146|Cc. Antya 10.146]]
  : Śivānanda Sena had bought very costly remnants of Lord Jagannātha's food. He brought it in and offered it to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who sat down to accept the prasāda with His associates.

  ; [[.10:147|Cc. Antya 10.147]]
  : Because of Śivānanda Sena's glories, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate all kinds of prasāda to honor his request. However, the Lord ate more than necessary, and therefore His mind was dissatisfied.

  ; [[.10:148|Cc. Antya 10.148]]
  : The next day, Caitanya dāsa, the son of Śivānanda Sena, extended an invitation to the Lord. He could understand the Lord's mind, however, and therefore he arranged for a different kind of food.

  ; [[.10:149|Cc. Antya 10.149]]
  : He offered yogurt, limes, ginger, soft baḍā and salt. Seeing all these arrangements, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased.
PURPORT

  ; [[.10:150|Cc. Antya 10.150]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "This boy knows My mind. Therefore I am very satisfied to keep his invitation."

  ; [[.10:151|Cc. Antya 10.151]]
  : After saying this, the Lord ate the rice mixed with yogurt and offered Caitanya dāsa the remnants of His food.

  ; [[.10:152|Cc. Antya 10.152]]
  : The four months of Cāturmāsya passed in this manner, with the Lord accepting invitations from His devotees. Because of a heavy schedule of invitations, however, some of the Vaiṣṇavas could not get an open day on which to invite the Lord.

  ; [[.10:153|Cc. Antya 10.153]]
  : Gadādhara Paṇḍita and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had fixed dates on which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would accept their invitations every month.

  ; [[.10:154-155|Cc. Antya 10.154-155]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya, Jagadānanda, Kāśīśvara, Bhagavān, Rāmabhadrācārya, Śaṅkara and Vakreśvara, who were all brāhmaṇas, extended invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and offered Him food cooked at home, whereas other devotees would pay two paṇas of small conchshells to purchase Jagannātha's prasāda and then invite the Lord.

  ; [[.10:156|Cc. Antya 10.156]]
  : At first the cost of Jagannātha prasāda for an invitation was four paṇas of conchshells, but when Rāmacandra Purī was there, the price was cut in half.

  ; [[.10:157|Cc. Antya 10.157]]
  : The devotees who came from Bengal stayed with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for four consecutive months, and then the Lord bade them farewell. After the Bengali devotees departed, the devotees who were the Lord's constant companions at Jagannātha Purī stayed with the Lord.

  ; [[.10:158|Cc. Antya 10.158]]
  : Thus I have described how Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted invitations and how He accepted and tasted the prasāda offered by His devotees.

  ; [[.10:159|Cc. Antya 10.159]]
  : In the midst of that narration are descriptions of Rāghava Paṇḍita's bags of food and the dancing in the temple of Jagannātha.

  ; [[.10:160|Cc. Antya 10.160]]
  : One who hears about the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with faith and love will certainly attain ecstatic love for the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu without fail.

  ; [[.10:161|Cc. Antya 10.161]]
  : Narrations of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's activities are just like nectar to hear. Indeed, they satisfy both the ears and mind. One who tastes the nectar of these activities is certainly very fortunate.

  ; [[.10:162|Cc. Antya 10.162]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
