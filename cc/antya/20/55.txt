{{description>"Why does a woman continue to live who knows that Kṛṣṇa's heart is unhappy but who still shows her deep anger toward Him? She is interested in her own happiness. I condemn such a woman to be struck on the head with a thunderbolt, for we simply want the happiness of Kṛṣṇa.}}

**"Why does a woman continue to live who knows that Kṛṣṇa's heart is unhappy but who still shows her deep anger toward Him? She is interested in her own happiness. I condemn such a woman to be struck on the head with a thunderbolt, for we simply want the happiness of Kṛṣṇa.**

===== Purport =====

A devotee who is satisfied only with his own sense gratification certainly falls down from the service of Kṛṣṇa. Being attracted by material happiness, he later joins the //prākṛta-sahajiyās,// who are considered to be nondevotees.
