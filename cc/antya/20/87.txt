===== Purport =====

The statement //āge vyāsa kariba varṇane// is similar to a text in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// (First Chapter, text 180) in which Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura says:

> śeṣa-khaṇḍe caitanyera ananta vilāsa
> vistāriyā varṇite āchena veda-vyāsa

"The unlimited pastimes of Śrī Caitanya will be described by Vyāsadeva in the future." Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that these statements indicate that in the future, other representatives of Vyāsadeva will elaborately describe Lord Caitanya's pastimes. The purport is that any pure devotee in the disciplic succession who describes the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is confirmed to be a representative of Vyāsadeva.
