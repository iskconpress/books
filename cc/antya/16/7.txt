In this connection Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura warns the men of this age not to imitate the jesting of a //mahā-bhāgavata// like Kālidāsa. If someone imitates him by playing with dice or gambling while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// he will certainly become a victim of offenses unto the holy name. As it is said, //hari-nāma-bale pāpe pravṛtti:// one must not commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Playing with dice is certainly gambling, but it is clearly said here that Kālidāsa did this only in jest. A //mahā-bhāgavata// can do anything, but he never forgets the basic principles. Therefore it is said, //vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:// "No one can understand the activities of a pure devotee." We should not imitate Kālidāsa.
