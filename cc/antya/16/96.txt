The remnants of Kṛṣṇa's food are mixed with His saliva. In the //Mahābhārata// and the //Skanda Purāṇa// it is stated:

> mahā-prasāde govinde
> nāma-brahmaṇi vaiṣṇave
> svalpa-puṇyavatāṁ rājan
> viśvāso naiva jāyate

"Persons who are not very highly elevated in pious activities cannot believe in the remnants of food [//prasāda//] of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor in Govinda, the holy name of the Lord, nor in the Vaiṣṇavas."
