{{description>" 'Although the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips is the absolute property of the gopīs, the flute, which is just an insignificant stick, is forcibly drinking that nectar and loudly inviting the gopīs to come drink it also. Just imagine the strength of the flute's austerities and good fortune. Even great devotees drink the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips after the flute has done so.}}
