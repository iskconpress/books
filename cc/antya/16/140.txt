{{description>"My dear gopīs, what auspicious activities must the flute have performed to enjoy the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips independently and leave only a taste for the gopīs for whom that nectar is actually meant. The forefathers of the flute, the bamboo trees, shed tears of pleasure. His mother, the river, on whose bank the bamboo was born, feels jubilation, and therefore her blooming lotus flowers are standing like hair on her body."}}

This is a verse quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.21.9) regarding a discussion the //gopīs// had among themselves. As the autumn season began in Vṛndāvana, Lord Kṛṣṇa was tending the cows and blowing on His flute. The //gopīs// then began to praise Kṛṣṇa and discuss the fortunate position of His flute.
