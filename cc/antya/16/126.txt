{{description>"Thereupon, the flute said angrily to Me, 'Give up Your shame, fear and religion and come drink the lips of Kṛṣṇa. On that condition, I shall give up my attachment for them. If You do not give up Your shame and fear, however, I shall continuously drink the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's lips. I am slightly fearful because You also have the right to drink that nectar, but as for the others, I consider them like straw.'}}
