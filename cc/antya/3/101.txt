In the days of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, all the //brāhmaṇas// worshiped Nārāyaṇa in the form of the //śālagrama-śilā.// Therefore begging from a //brāhmaṇa's// house meant taking //kṛṣṇa-prasāda,// which is transcendental (//nirguṇa).// If we take food from the house of others, such as //karmīs,// we shall have to share the qualities of those from whom we take alms. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took //prasāda// in the houses of Vaiṣṇavas. This is the general process. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are advised not to take food from anywhere but a Vaiṣṇava's or //brāhmaṇa's// house where Deity worship is performed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, //viṣayīra anna khāile duṣṭa haya mana:// if a devotee takes alms or food from the house of a //karmī// who is simply interested in money, his mind will be unclean. We must always remember that a devotee's life is one of //vairāgya-vidyā,// or renunciation and knowledge. Therefore all devotees are warned not to live unnecessarily luxurious lives at the cost of others. //Gṛhasthas// living within the jurisdiction of the temple must be especially careful not to imitate //karmīs// by acquiring opulent clothing, food and conveyances. As far as possible, these should be avoided. A member of the temple, whether //gṛhastha, brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī,// must practice a life of renunciation, following in the footsteps of Haridāsa Ṭhākura and the six Gosvāmīs. Otherwise, because //māyā// is very strong, at any time one may become a victim of //māyā// and fall down from spiritual life.
