===== Purport =====

Vaiṣṇavas strictly follow the directions of the //śāstras// regarding how one can be liberated simply by a slight awakening of pure chanting of the holy name. Māyāvādīs cannot tolerate the statements of the //śāstras// about how easily liberation can be achieved, for as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:12:5|(Bg. 12.5)]], //kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām:// impersonalists must work hard for many, many births, and only then will they perhaps be liberated. Vaiṣṇavas know that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord offenselessly, one achieves liberation as a by-product. Thus there is no need to endeavor separately for liberation. Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura has said, //muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān:// liberation stands at one's door, ready to render any kind of service, if one is a pure devotee with unflinching faith and reverence. This the Māyāvādīs cannot tolerate. Therefore the //ārindā pradhāna,// chief tax collector, although very learned, handsome and youthful, could not tolerate the statements of Haridāsa Ṭhākura
