It is said, //phalena paricīyate:// one is recognized by the result of his actions. In Vaiṣṇava society there are many types of Vaiṣṇavas. Some of them are called //gosvāmīs,// some are called //svāmīs,// some are //prabhus,// and some are //prabhupāda.// One is not recognized, however, simply by such a name. A spiritual master is recognized as an actual //guru// when it is seen that he has changed the character of his disciples. Haridāsa Ṭhākura actually changed the character of the professional prostitute. People greatly appreciated this, and therefore they all offered obeisances to Haridāsa Ṭhākura and glorified him.
