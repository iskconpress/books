The village of Cāndapura is situated near the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamunā at Saptagrāma in the district of Huglī. Cāndapura is just east of the house of the two brothers Hiraṇya and Govardhana, the father and uncle of Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. In Cāndapura lived Balarāma Ācārya and Yadunandana Ācārya, the priests of these two personalities, and when Haridāsa Ṭhākura went there he lived with them. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the name of this village was later changed to Kṛṣṇapura.
