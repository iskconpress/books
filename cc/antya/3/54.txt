If a child touches fire, the fire will burn him, and if an elderly man touches fire, it will burn him also. Haridāsa Ṭhākura says that a great devotee of the Lord exclaims, //"hā rāma, hā rāma,//"but although //yavanas// do not know the transcendental meaning of //"hā rāma, hā rāma,//"they say those words in the course of their ordinary life. For the //yavanas// the words //"hā rāma//" mean "abominable," whereas the devotee exclaims the words //"hā rāma//" in ecstatic love. Nevertheless, because the words //"hā rāma//" are the spiritual //summum bonum,// the fact is the same, whether they are uttered by //yavanas// or by great devotees, just as fire is the same both for a child and for an elderly man. In other words, the holy name of the Lord, //"hā rāma,//"always acts, even when the holy names are chanted without reference to the Supreme Lord. //Yavanas// utter the holy name in a different attitude than devotees, but the holy name //"hā rāma//" is so powerful spiritually that it acts anywhere, whether one knows it or not. This is explained as follows.
