The village of Benāpola is situated in the district of Yaśohara, which is now in Bangladesh. Benāpola is near the Banagāṅo station, which is at the border of Bangladesh and may be reached by the eastern railway from Shelda Station in Calcutta. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, being the //ācārya// of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// is called Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura. From his personal Example we can understand that chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and becoming highly elevated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very simple. Without difficulty one can sit down anywhere, especially on the bank of the Ganges, Yamunā or any sacred river, devise a sitting place or cottage, plant a tulasī, and before the tulasī chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// undisturbed.

Haridāsa Ṭhākura used to chant the holy name on his beads 300,000 times daily. Throughout the entire day and night, he would chant the sixteen names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// One should not, however, imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, for no one else can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// 300,000 times a day. Such chanting is for the //mukta-puruṣa,// or liberated soul. We can follow his example, however, by chanting sixteen rounds of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// on beads every day and offering respect to the //tulasī// plant. This is not at all difficult for anyone, and the process of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// with a vow before the //tulasī// plant has such great spiritual potency that simply by doing this one can become spiritually strong. Therefore we request the members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement to follow Haridāsa Ṭhākura's example rigidly. Chanting sixteen rounds does not take much time, nor is offering respects to the //tulasī// plant difficult. The process has immense spiritual potency. One should not miss this opportunity.
