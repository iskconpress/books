Rāmacandra Khān was a great offender at the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas and Viṣṇu. Just as Rāvaṇa, although born of a //brāhmaṇa// father, Viśvaśravā, was nevertheless called an //asura// or //rākṣasa// because of his offenses against Lord Rāmacandra (Viṣṇu) and Hanumān (a Vaiṣṇava), so Rāmacandra Khān also became such an //asura// because of his offenses against Haridāsa Ṭhākura and many others.
