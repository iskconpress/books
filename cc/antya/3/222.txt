//Śrāddha// is //prasāda// offered to the forefathers at a certain date of the year or month. The //śrāddha-pātra,// or plate offered to the forefathers, is then offered to the best of the //brāhmaṇas// in society. instead of offering the //śrāddha-pātra// to any other //brāhmaṇa,// Advaita Ācārya offered it to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, considering him greater than any of the foremost //brāhmaṇas.// This act by Śrī Advaita Ācārya proves that Haridāsa Ṭhākura was always situated in a transcendental position and was therefore always greater than even the most exalted //brāhmaṇa,// for he was situated above the mode of goodness of the material world. Referring to the //Bhakti-sandarbha,// verse 177, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes the following statements from the //Garuḍa Purāṇa// in this connection:

> brāhmaṇānāṁ sahasrebhyaḥ
> satra-yājī viśiṣyate
> satra-yāji-sahasrebhyaḥ
> sarva-vedānta-pāragaḥ
>
> sarva-vedānta-vit-koṭyā
> viṣṇu-bhakto viśiṣyate
> vaiṣṇavānāṁ sahasrebhya
> ekānty eko viśiṣyate

"A //brāhmaṇa// qualified to offer sacrifices is better than an ordinary //brāhmaṇa// and better than such a //brāhmaṇa// is one who has studied all the Vedic scriptures. Among many such //brāhmaṇas,// one who is a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu is the best; and among many such Vaiṣṇavas, one who fully engages in the service of the Lord is the best."

> bhaktir aṣṭa-vidhā hy eṣā
> yasmin mlecche 'pi vartate
> sa viprendro muni-śreṣṭhaḥ
> sa jñānī sa ca paṇḍitaḥ
> tasmai deyaṁ tato grāhyaṁ
> sa ca pūjyo yathā hariḥ

"There are many different kinds of devotees, but even a Vaiṣṇava coming from a family of //mlecchas// or //yavanas// is understood to be a learned scholar, complete in knowledge, if he knows the Vaiṣṇava philosophy. He should therefore be given charity, for such a Vaiṣṇava is as worshipable as the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

> na me 'bhaktaś catur-vedī
> mad-bhaktaḥ śva-pacaḥ priyaḥ
> tasmai deyaṁ tato grāhyaṁ
> sa ca pūjyo yathā hy aham

Lord Kṛṣṇa says, "Even if a nondevotee comes from a //brāhmaṇa// family and is expert in studying the //Vedas,// he is not very dear to Me, whereas even if a sincere devotee comes from a low family of meat-eaters, he is very dear to Me. Such a sincere pure devotee should be given charity, for he is as worshipable as I."
