This verse reveals the significance of Lord Śrī Caitanya's appearance as //patita-pāvana,// the deliverer of all the fallen souls. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, //patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra:// "O my Lord, You have appeared just to deliver all the fallen souls." //mo-sama patita prabhu nā pāibe āra:// "And among all the fallen souls, I am the lowest." How Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls is shown by the statement //e duḥkha apāra// ("It is My great unhappiness"). This statement indicates that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the Supreme personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself, is always very unhappy to see the fallen souls in the material world. Therefore He Himself comes as He is, or He comes as a devotee in the form of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to deliver love of Kṛṣṇa directly to the fallen souls. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāyate.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so merciful that He not only gives knowledge of Kṛṣṇa but by His practical activities teaches everyone how to love Kṛṣṇa (//kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te).//

Those who are following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should take the Lord's mission most seriously. In this age of Kali, people are gradually becoming less than animals. Nevertheless, although they are eating the flesh of cows and are envious of brahminical culture, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is considering how to deliver them from this horrible condition of life. Thus He asks all Indians to take up His mission.

"One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India [Bhārata-varṣa] should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people." [[books:cc:adi:9:41|(Cc. Ādi-līlā 9.41)]] it is therefore the duty of every advanced and cultured Indian to take this cause very seriously. All Indians should help the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in its progress, to the best of their ability. Then they will be considered real followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Unfortunately, even some so-called Vaiṣṇavas enviously refuse to cooperate with this movement but instead condemn it in so many ways. We are very sorry to say that these people try to find fault with us, being unnecessarily envious of our activities, although we are trying to the best of our ability to introduce the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement directly into the countries of the //yavanas// and //mlecchas.// Such //yavanas// and //mlecchas// are coming to us and becoming purified Vaiṣṇavas who follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who identifies himself as a follower of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should feel like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who said, //ihā-sabāra kon mate ha-ibe nistāra:// "How will all these //yavanas// be delivered?" Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always anxious to deliver the fallen souls because their fallen condition gave Him great unhappiness. That is the platform on which one can propagate the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
