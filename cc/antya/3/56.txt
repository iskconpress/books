===== Translation =====

**"Even a mleccha who is being killed by the tusk of a boar and who cries in distress again and again, "hā rāma, hā rāma" attains liberation. What then to speak of those who chant the holy name with veneration and faith?"**

===== Purport =====

This refers to an instance in which a meat-eater being killed by a boar uttered the words //"hā rāma, hā rāma//"again and again at the time of his death. Since this is a quotation from the //Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa,// this indicates that in the purāṇic age there must also have been //mlecchas// and //yavanas// (meateaters), and the words //"hā rāma,,// meaning "condemned," were also uttered in those days. Thus Haridāsa Ṭhākura gives evidence that even a meat-eater who condemns something by uttering the words //"hā rāma//" gets the benefit of chanting the holy name that the devotee chants to mean "O my Lord Rāma."
