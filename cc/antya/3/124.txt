If one regularly chants 333,333 times daily for a month and then chants one time more, he will thus chant ten million times. In this way a devotee worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such worship is called //yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:// those whose intelligence is brilliant accept this //hari-nāma-yajña,// the //yajña// of chanting the holy name of the Lord. By performing this //yajña,// one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus attains perfection in spiritual life. According to external vision, Haridāsa Ṭhākura belonged to a Mohammedan family. Nevertheless, because he engaged himself in performing the //yajña// of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// he became a regularly initiated //brāhmaṇa.// As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:33:6|(3.33.6)]]:

> yan-nāmadheya-śravaṇānukīrtanād
> yat-prahvaṇād yat-smaraṇād api kvacit
> śvādo 'pi sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate
> kutaḥ punas te bhagavan nu darśanāt

Even if a devotee comes from a family of dog-eaters, if he surrenders to the personality of Godhead he immediately becomes a qualified //brāhmaṇa// and is immediately fit to perform //yajña,// whereas a person born in a family of //brāhmaṇas// has to wait until completing the reformatory processes before he may be called //saṁskṛta,// purified. It is further said in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.1.40):

> asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā-hīnā
> rajasā tamasāvṛtāḥ
> prajās te bhakṣayiṣyanti
> mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ

"In the age of Kali, //mlecchas,// or lowborn people who have not undergone the purifying process of //saṁskāra,// who do not know how to apply that process in actual life and who are covered by the modes of passion and ignorance, will take the posts of administrators. They will devour the citizens with their atheistic activities." A person who is not purified by the prescribed process of //saṁskāra// is called //asaṁskṛta,// but if one remains //kriyā-hīna// even after being purified by initiation-in other words, if one fails to actually apply the principles of purity in his life-he remains an unpurified //mleccha// or //yavana.// On the other hand, we find that Haridāsa Ṭhākura, although born in a //mleccha// or //yavana// family, became Nāmācārya Haridāsa Ṭhākura because he performed the //nāma-yajña// a minimum of 300,000 times every day.

Herein we find that Haridāsa Ṭhākura strictly followed his regulative principle of chanting 300,000 times. Thus when the prostitute became restless, he informed her that first he had to finish his chanting and then he would be able to satisfy her. Actually Haridāsa Ṭhākura chanted the holy name of the Lord for three nights continuously and gave the prostitute a chance to hear him. Thus she became purified, as will be seen in the following verses.
