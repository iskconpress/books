The philosophy enunciated by the Māyāvādīs is called //ghaṭa-paṭiyā// philosophy. According to this philosophy, everything is one, everything is earth, and therefore anything made of earth, such as different pots, is also the same earth. Such philosophers see no distinction between a pot made of earth and the earth itself. Since Gopāla Cakravartī was a //ghaṭa-paṭiyā// logician, a gross materialist, what could he understand about the transcendental devotional service of the Lord?
