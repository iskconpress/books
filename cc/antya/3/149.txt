Lord Kṛṣṇa appears in every millennium for two purposes, namely to deliver the devotees and kill the nondevotees. His devotees also have two similar purposes-to preach the //bhakti// cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and defeat all kinds of agnostics and atheistic demons. Nityānanda Prabhu carried out the order of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in this way, and those who strictly follow Nityānanda Prabhu perform the same activities. There are two classes of devotees. One is called //goṣṭhyānandī,// and the other is called //bhajanānandī.// A devotee who does not preach but always engages in devotional activities is called a //bhajanānandī,// whereas a devotee who not only is expert in devotional service but who also preaches the cult of //bhakti// and defeats all kinds of agnostics is called a //goṣṭhyānandī.//
