Haridāsa Ṭhākura's instruction that the prostitute should distribute to the //brāhmaṇas// all the property she had at home is very significant. Haridāsa Ṭhākura never advised the prostitute to give charity to the so-called //daridra-nārāyaṇa// ("poor Nārāyaṇa") or any other such persons. According to Vedic civilization, charity should be given only to the qualified //brāhmaṇas.// As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:42|(Bg. 18.42)]]:

The brahminical qualifications are truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, tolerance, simplicity, knowledge, practical application of transcendental knowledge in one's life, and full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. persons engaged in pursuing spiritual understanding have no time to earn their livelihood. They depend completely on the mercy of the Lord, who says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:22|(Bg. 9.22)]] that He personally carries to them all their necessities (//yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham).//

The Vedic civilization recommends that one give charity to //brāhmaṇas// and //sannyāsīs,// not to the so-called //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// Nārāyaṇa cannot be //daridra,// nor can //daridra// be Nārāyaṇa, for these are contradictory terms. Atheistic men invent such concoctions and preach them to fools, but charity should actually be given to //brāhmaṇas// and //sannyāsīs// because whatever money they get they spend for Kṛṣṇa. Whatever charity one gives to a //brāhmaṇa// goes to Kṛṣṇa, who says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:27|(Bg. 9.27)]]:

> yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi
> yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat
> yat tapasyasi kaunteya
> tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam

"O son of Kunti, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me." Everything actually belongs to Kṛṣṇa, but so-called civilized men unfortunately think that everything belongs to them. This is the mistake of materialistic civilization. The prostitute (//veśyā//) had earned money by questionable means, and therefore Haridāsa Ṭhākura advised her to distribute to the //brāhmaṇas// whatever she possessed. When Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī retired from family life, he distributed fifty percent of his income to the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas. A //brāhmaṇa// knows what the Absolute Truth is, and a Vaiṣṇava, knowing the Absolute Truth, acts on behalf of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme personality of Godhead. Generally one earns money by many questionable means. Therefore at some time one should retire and distribute whatever one has to the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas who engage in devotional service by preaching the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
