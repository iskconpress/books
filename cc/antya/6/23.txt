===== Purport =====

Raghunātha dāsa belonged to a very aristocratic family of the //kāyastha// community. He had substantial influence with the local people, and therefore the //caudhurī,// or minister, was afraid to beat him. Superficially he would chastise Raghunātha dāsa with threatening vibrations, but he did not beat him. The members of the //kāyastha// community in India are generally very intelligent and expert in business management. Formerly they were mostly government officers. They were mentioned even by Yājñavalkya, as quoted by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya://

> cāta-taṣkara-durvṛttair
> mahā-sāhasikādibhiḥ
> pīḍyamānā prajā rakṣet
> kāyasthaiś ca viśeṣṭaḥ

From this verse it appears that the governmental officials of the //kāyastha// community would sometimes chastise the citizens, and thus it was the duty of the king to protect the people in general from the atrocities of the //kāyasthas.// In Bengal the //kāyastha// community is honored almost as much as the //brāhmaṇa// community, but in the up-country of India the //kāyasthas// are considered //śūdras// because they generally eat meat and drink wine. In any case, from history the //kāyasthas// appear very intelligent. Thus the Mohammedan //caudhurī// was afraid of Raghunātha dāsa because he belonged to the //kāyastha// community.
