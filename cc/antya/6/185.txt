Chatrabhoga, known now as Chāḍa-khāḍi, is in the district of twenty-four pargaṇās in West Bengal. It is situated near the celebrated village Jayanagara-majilapura. Formerly the Ganges or some of its branches flowed through this region. Sometimes Chatrabhoga is misunderstood to have been a village on the River Kāṅsāi-nadī in Benāpola.
