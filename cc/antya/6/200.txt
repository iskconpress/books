===== Purport =====

in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.54) it is said, //karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bha-jām.// Lord Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He can stop the reaction of //karma// for His devotee. Everyone-from a small insect called //indra-gopa// up to Indra, the King of heaven-is bound by the reactions of fruitive activities.

> bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam ātanoti
> karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

Everyone, whether like an insect or the King of heaven, is entangled and bound by the actions and reactions of his //karma// However, when one becomes a pure devotee, free from material desires and from bondage to //karma, jñāna// and yoga, one is freed from material actions and reactions by the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa. One cannot express sufficient gratitude to Kṛṣṇa for being freed from the materialistic way of life.
