Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya// that when a man and woman are married, they beget children and are thus entangled in family life. Talk concerning such family life is called //grāmya-kathā.// A person in the renounced order never indulges in either hearing or talking about such subjects. He should not eat palatable dishes, since that is unfit for a person in the renounced order. He should show all respect to others, but should not expect respect for himself. In this way, one should chant the holy name of the Lord and think of how to serve Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana.
