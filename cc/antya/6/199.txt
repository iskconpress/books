===== Purport =====

As clearly stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]], //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yam-karma-bandhanaḥ:// if one does not act as a pure devotee, whatever acts he per forms will produce reactions of fruitive bondage //(karma-bandhanaḥ).// In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said:

> nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma
> yad-indriya-prīta ya āpṛṇoti
> na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam
> asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ

"A materialistic person, madly engaged in activities for sense enjoyment, does not know that he is entangling himself in repeated birth and death and that his body, although temporary, is full of miseries." [[books:sb:5:5:4|(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.4)]] A viṣayī, a person blindly caught in a web of materialistic life, remains in the cycle of birth and death perpetually. Such a person cannot understand how to execute pure devotional service, and therefore he acts as a //karmī, jñānī, yogī// or something else, according to his desire, but he does not know that the activities of //karma, jñāna// and yoga simply bind one to the cycle of birth and death.
