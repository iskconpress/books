**PURPORT**

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura suggests that people who are materialistically inclined and //sahajiyās,// or so-called Vaiṣṇavas who take everything very casually, are both //viṣayi// materialists. Eating food offered by them causes contamination, and as a result of such contamination, even a serious devotee becomes like a materialistic man. There are six kinds of association-giving charity, accepting charity, accepting food, offering food, talking confidentially and inquiring confidentially. One should very carefully avoid associating with both the //sahajiyās,// who are sometimes known as Vaiṣṇavas, and the non-Vaiṣṇavas, or avaiṣṇavas. Their association changes the transcendental devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa into sense gratification, and when sense gratification enters the mind of a devotee, he is contaminated. The materialistic person who aspires after sense gratification cannot properly think of Kṛṣṇa.
