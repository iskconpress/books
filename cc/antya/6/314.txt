===== Purport =====

This verse [[books:sb:7:15:40|(Bhāg. 7.15.40)]] was spoken by Nārada to Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja regarding a householder's liberation from material bondage. On the spiritual platform, one does not unnecessarily care for the body. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, //deha-smṛti nāhi yāra, saṁsāra bandhana kāhāṅ tāra.// One who is spiritually situated does not think that he is the body. Therefore he can transcendentally execute severe penances in the renounced order of life. The best example of such renunciation is Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī.
