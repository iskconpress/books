Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes: "The //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// was originally compiled by Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. Later, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī produced a shortened version of it and added the //Dig-darśinī-ṭīkā.// In the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// there are so many quotations from the //sātvata// scriptures that sometimes it is inquired how the atheistic //smārtas// can refuse to accept them and instead imagine some other opinions. What is recorded in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// strictly follows the Vedic scriptures and is certainly pure, but the attitude of the //karmīs// is always one of giving up the conclusion of pure Vaiṣṇava understanding. Because the //karmīs// are very much attached to the world and material activities, they always try to establish atheistic principles that oppose the understanding of the Vaiṣṇavas.
