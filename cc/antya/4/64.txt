{{description>" 'O dear Kṛṣṇa, by Your smiling glances and melodious talk, You have awakened a fire of lusty desire in our hearts. Now You should extinguish that fire with a stream of nectar from Your lips by kissing us. Kindly do this. Otherwise, dear friend, the fire within our hearts will burn our bodies to ashes because of separation from You. Thus by meditation we shall claim shelter at Your lotus feet.' "}}

This verse (//Bhāg.// 10.29.35) was spoken by the //gopīs// when they were attracted by the vibration of Kṛṣṇa's flute in the moonlight of autumn. All of them, being maddened, came to Kṛṣṇa, but to increase their ecstatic love, Kṛṣṇa gave them moral instructions to return home. The //gopīs// did not care for these instructions. They wanted to be kissed by Kṛṣṇa, for they had come there with lusty desires to dance with Him.
