Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura writes in a song (//Śaraṇāgati// 31.3):

> gaura āmāra, ye saba sthāne,
> karala bhramaṇa raṅge
> se-saba sthāna, heriba āmi,
> praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge.

"May I visit all the holy places associated with the //līlās// of Lord Caitanya and His devotees." A devotee should make a point of visiting all the places where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed His pastimes. Indeed, pure devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu even want to see the places He simply visited for only hours or minutes.
