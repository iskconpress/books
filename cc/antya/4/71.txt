Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhu gives the following directions in his //Bhakti-sandarbha// (270):

> iyaṁ ca kīrtanākhyā bhaktir bhagavato dravya-jāti-guṇa-kriyābhir dīna-janaika-viṣayāpāra-karuṇā-mayīti śruti-purāṇādi-viśrutiḥ. ataeva kalau svabhāvata evātidīneṣu lokeṣu āvirbhūya tān anāyāsenaiva tat tad yuga-gata-mahā-sādhanānāṁ sarvam eva phalaṁ dadānā sā kṛtārthayati. yata eva tayaiva kalau bhagavato viśeṣataś ca santoṣo bhavati.

"Chanting the holy name is the chief means of attaining love of Godhead. This chanting or devotional service does not depend on any paraphernalia, nor on one's having taken birth in a good family. By humility and meekness one attracts the attention of Kṛṣṇa. That is the verdict of all the //Vedas.// Therefore if one becomes very humble and meek, he can easily attain the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in this age of Kali. That is the fulfillment of all great sacrifices, penances and austerities because when one achieves ecstatic love of Godhead, he attains the complete perfection of life. Therefore whatever one does in executing devotional service must be accompanied with the chanting of the holy name of the Lord." The chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa-Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare-has been praised by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Nāmāṣṭaka// (verse 1):

> nikhila-śruti-mauli-ratna-mālā-
> dyuti-nīrājita-pāda-paṅkajānta
> ayi mukta-kulair upāsyamānaṁ
> paritas tvāṁ hari-nāma saṁśrayāmi

"O Hari-nāma! The tips of the toes of Your lotus feet are constantly being worshiped by the glowing radiance emanating from the string of gems known as the //Upaniṣads,// the crown jewels of all the //Vedas.// You are eternally adored by liberated souls such as Nārada and Śukadeva. O Hari-nāma! I take complete shelter of You."

Similarly, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has praised the chanting of the holy name as follows in his //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta// (Chapter One, verse 9):

> jayati jayati nāmānanda-rūpaṁ murārer
> viramita-nija-dharma-dhyāna-pūjādi-yatnam
> kathamapi sakṛd-āttaṁ muktidaṁ prāṇīnāṁ yat
> paramam amṛtam ekaṁ jīvanaṁ bhūṣaṇaṁ me

"All glories, all glories to the all-blissful holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, which causes the devotee to give up all conventional religious duties, meditation and worship. When somehow or other uttered even once by a living entity, the holy name awards him liberation. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is the highest nectar. It is my very life and my only treasure."

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:1:11|(2.1.11)]] Śukadeva Gosvāmī says:

> etan nirvidyamānānām
> icchatām akuto-bhayam
> yogināṁ nṛpa nirṇītaṁ
> harer nāmānukīrtanam

"O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge."

Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said in His //Śikṣāṣṭaka//(3):

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ

"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly." Regarding the ten offenses in chanting the holy name, one may refer to the //Ādi-līlā,// Chapter Eight, verse 24.
