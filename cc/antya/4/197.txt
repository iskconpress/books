**"Sanātana Gosvāmī is one of the associates of Kṛṣṇa. There could not be any bad odor from his body. On the first day I embraced him, I smelled the aroma of catuḥsama [a mixture of sandalwood pulp, camphor, aguru and musk]."**

===== Purport =====

An associate of the Lord is one whose body is fully engaged in the service of the Lord. A materialist might see Sanātana Gosvāmī's body as being full of itching sores that exuded foul moisture and a bad smell. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, said that actually the aroma of his body was the excellent scent of a mixture of sandalwood pulp, camphor, musk and aguru. In the //Garuḍa Purāṇa// this mixture, which is called //catuḥsama,// is described as follows:

> kastūrikāyā dvau bhāgau
> catvāraś candanasya tu
> kuṅkumasya trayaś caikaḥ
> śaśinaḥ syāt catuḥsamam

"Two parts of musk, four parts of sandalwood, three parts of //aguru// or saffron and one part of camphor, when mixed together, form //catuḥsama.//" he aroma of //catuḥsama// is very pleasing. It is also mentioned in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (6.115).
