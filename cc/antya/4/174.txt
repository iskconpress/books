Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Sanātana Gosvāmī, "Since you are a Vaiṣṇava, your body is spiritual, not material. Therefore you should not consider this body to be subjected to superior or inferior qualities. Moreover, I am a //sannyāsī.// Therefore even if your body were material, a //sannyāsī// should see no distinction between a good body and a bad body.
