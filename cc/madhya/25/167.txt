Both Navadvīpa and Vārāṇasī were celebrated for their highly educational activities. At the present time these cities are still inhabited by great, learned scholars, but Vārāṇasī is especially a center for Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// who are learned scholars. However, unlike Navadvīpa, there are hardly any devotees in Vārāṇasī. Consequently a discussion of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was very rare in Vārāṇasī. In Navadvīpa, such a discussion was quite ordinary. After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited Vārāṇasī and turned Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and his disciples into Vaiṣṇavas, Vārāṇasī became like Navadvīpa because so many devotees began discussing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Even at the present moment one can hear many discussions on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// taking place on the banks of the Ganges. Many scholars and //sannyāsīs// gather there to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and perform //saṅkīrtana.//
