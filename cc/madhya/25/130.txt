This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.30.4). The //gopīs// almost went mad due to Kṛṣṇa's suddenly leaving the //rāsa// dance. Because the //gopīs// were fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, they were imitating His different postures and pastimes. They became very saddened because of His absence, and this incident is explained by Śukadeva Gosvāmī to Mahārāja Parīkṣit.
