The sound vibration //oṁkāra// is the root of Vedic knowledge. This //oṁkāra// is known as //mahā-vākya,// or the supreme sound. Whatever meaning is in the supreme sound //oṁkāra// is further understood in the Gāyatrī //mantra.// Again, this same meaning is explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the four //ślokas// known as //catuḥ-ślokī,// which begin with the words //ahaṁ evāsam evāgre.// The Lord says, "Only I existed before the creation." From this verse, four //ślokas// have been composed, and these are known as the //catuḥ-ślokī.// In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead informed Lord Brahmā about the purpose of the //catuḥ-ślokī.// Again, Lord Brahmā explained this to Nārada Muni, and Nārada Muni explained it to Śrīla Vyāsadeva. This is the //paramparā// system, the disciplic succession. The import of Vedic knowledge, the original word //praṇava,// has been explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The conclusion is that the //Brahma-sūtra// is explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//
