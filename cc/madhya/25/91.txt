===== Purport =====

An ordinary living being cannot actually understand the purpose of the //Vedānta-sūtra.// One can understand the purpose if he hears it from the authority, Vyāsadeva himself. For this reason, Vyāsadeva gave a commentary on the //Brahma-sūtra// in the form of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He had been instructed to do this by his spiritual master, Nārada. Of course, Śaṅkarācārya distorted the purpose of the //Brahma-sūtra// because he had a motive to serve. He wanted to establish Vedic knowledge in place of the atheistic knowledge spread by Lord Buddha. All these necessities are there according to time and circumstances. Neither Lord Buddha nor Śaṅkarācārya is to be blamed. The time required such an explanation for the understanding of various types of atheists. The conclusion is that one cannot understand the purpose of the //Vedānta-sūtra// without going through //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and rendering devotional service. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore further explains the matter in the following verses.
