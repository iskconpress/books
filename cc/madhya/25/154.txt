===== Purport =====

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that without studying //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// one cannot understand the purport of //Brahma-sūtra// (//Vedānta-sūtra//) or the //Upaniṣads.// If one tries to understand Vedānta philosophy and the //Upaniṣads// without studying //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// he will be bewildered and, construing a different meaning will gradually become an atheist or an impersonalist.
