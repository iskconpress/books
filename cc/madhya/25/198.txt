This is a solution to all sinful activities. In this Age of Kali everyone is perplexed by so many inconveniences-social, political and religious-and naturally no one is happy. Due to the contamination of this age, everyone has a very short life. There are many fools and rascals who advise people to adopt this way of life or that way of life, but real liberation from life's perplexities means preparation for the next life. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati.// One should be situated in his spiritual identity and return home, back to Godhead. The simplest method for this is recommended herein by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is recommending this process all over the world. We are saying, "Chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// be freed from all the complexities of life and realize Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Engage in His devotional service and perfect your life so that you can return home, back to Godhead."
