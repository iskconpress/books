Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He nonetheless, to teach us a lesson, denied belonging to the Viṣṇu category. Unfortunately, there are many so-called Viṣṇu incarnations in this Age of Kali. People do not know that posing oneself as an incarnation is most offensive. People should not accept an ordinary man as an incarnation of God, for this also is a very great offense.
