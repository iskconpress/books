===== Translation =====

**When Subuddhi Rāya consulted some other brāhmaṇas, they told him that he had not committed a grievous fault and that consequently he should not drink hot ghee and give up his life. As a result, Subuddhi Rāya was doubtful about what to do.**

===== Purport =====

This is another instance of Hindu custom. One //brāhmaṇa// would give advice condoning a particular fault, and another would give advice to the contrary. Typically, lawyers and physicians differ, giving one kind of instruction and then another. Due to the //brāhmaṇas'// different opinions, Subuddhi Rāya became further perplexed. He did not know what to do or what not to do.
