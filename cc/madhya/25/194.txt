===== Purport =====

It appears that Subuddhi Rāya was a big landholder and a responsible, respectable gentleman. He could not, however, avoid the social misconception that one becomes a Mohammedan when water is sprinkled on one's face from a Mohammedan's pitcher. Actually he was planning to give up his material life and leave his family. Hindu culture recommends four divisions-//brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// Subuddhi Rāya was thinking of taking //sannyāsa,// and by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, he received this opportunity. He therefore left his family and went to Vārāṇasī. The system of //varṇāśrama-dharma// is very scientific. If one is directed by the //varṇāśrama// institution, he will naturally think of retiring from family life at the end of his life. Therefore //sannyāsa// is compulsory at the age of fifty.
