Spiritual knowledge means fully understanding the Absolute Truth in three features-impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and the all-powerful Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimately when one takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in the Lord's service, the resultant knowledge is called //vijñāna,// special knowledge, or the practical application of spiritual knowledge. One should be engaged in the Lord's devotional service to achieve the aim of life, called //prayojana.// The practice of devotional service to attain that goal of life is called //abhidheya.//
