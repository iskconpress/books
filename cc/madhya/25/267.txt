Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as an ideal teacher, or //ācārya,// explained //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// very elaborately Himself. He sometimes also empowered His devotees to speak while He listened. This is the way an //ācārya// should train His disciples. Not only should he describe the //bhāgavata// cult personally, but he should also train his disciples to speak on this sublime subject.
