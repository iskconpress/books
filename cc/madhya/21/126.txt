The entire face is called the king of moons. The mouth is another moon, the left cheek is a moon, and the right cheek is a moon. The spots of sandalwood pulp on Kṛṣṇa's face are also considered different moons, and His fingernails and toenails are also different moons. His forehead is considered a half moon, His face is considered the king of moons, and His body is considered the throne. All the other //candras// (moons) are considered to be subordinate moons.
