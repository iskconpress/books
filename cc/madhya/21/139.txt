{{description>"The beauty of Kṛṣṇa's smile is the sweetest feature of all. His smile is like a full moon that spreads its rays throughout the three worlds-Goloka Vṛndāvana, the spiritual sky of the Vaikuṇṭhas, and Devī-dhāma, the material world. Thus Kṛṣṇa's shining beauty spreads in all ten directions.}}
