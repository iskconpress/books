===== Purport =====

Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are called //cira-loka-pāla,// permanent governors. This means that they govern the affairs of the universe from the beginning of the creation to the end. In the next creation, the same living entities may not be present, but because Brahmā and Śiva are existing from the beginning to the end, they are called //cira-loka-pāla,// permanent governors. //Loka-pāla// means "predominating deities." There are eight predominating deities of the prominent heavenly planets, and they are Indra, Agni, Yama, Varuṇa, Nirṛti, Vāyu, Kuvera and Śiva.
