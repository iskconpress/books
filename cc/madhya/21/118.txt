{{description>"Both the gopīs and Kṛṣṇa are complete. The gopīs' ecstatic love is like a mirror that becomes newer and newer at every moment and reflects Kṛṣṇa's bodily luster and sweetness. Thus competition increases. Since neither give up, their pastimes become newer and newer, and both sides constantly increase.}}
