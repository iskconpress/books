This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.14.38), spoken by Lord Brahmā after he had stolen Lord Kṛṣṇa's cows, calves and cowherd boys and Kṛṣṇa had exhibited His transcendental opulence by re-creating all the stolen cows, calves and cowherd boys by His //viṣṇu-mūrti// expansions. After he had seen this, Brahmā offered the above prayer.
