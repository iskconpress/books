===== Purport =====

Because he wants to enjoy the material energy, the conditioned soul is allowed to reside in Devī-dhāma, the external energy, where the goddess Durgā carries out the orders of the Supreme Lord as His maidservant. The material energy is called //jagal-lakṣmī// because she protects the bewildered conditioned souls. The goddess Durgā is therefore known as the mother, and Lord Śiva, her husband, is known as the father. Lord Śiva and goddess Durgā are therefore known as the material father and mother. Goddess Durgā is so named because this material world is like a big fort where the conditioned soul is placed under her care. For material facilities, the conditioned soul tries to please the goddess Durgā, and mother Durgā supplies all kinds of material facilities. Because of this, the conditioned souls are allured and do not wish to leave the external energy. Consequently they are continuously making plans to live here peacefully and happily. Such is the material world.
