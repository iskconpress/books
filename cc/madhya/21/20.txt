===== Purport =====

According to Vedic mathematical calculations, the following enumeration system is used: units, tens (//daśa//), hundreds (//śata//), thousands (//sahasra//), ten thousands (//ayuta//) and hundred thousands (//lakṣa).// Ten times //lakṣa// is //niyuta.// Ten times //niyuta// is //koṭi.// Ten times //koṭi// is //arbuda.// Ten times //arbuda// is //vṛnda.// Ten times //vṛnda// is //kharva.// Ten times //kharva// is //nikharva.// Ten times //nikharva// is //śaṅkha.// Ten times //śaṅkha// is //padma,// and ten times //padma// is //sāgara.// Ten times //sāgara// is //antya,// and ten times //antya// is //madhya,// and ten times //madhya// is //parārdha.// Each item is ten times greater than the previous one. Thus all the cowherd boys who were companions of Kṛṣṇa had many calves to take care of.
