**"There is a very deep meaning in the word tryadhīśvara, which indicates that Kṛṣṇa possesses three different lokas, or natures.**

===== Purport =====

The word //tryadhīśvara// means "proprietor of the three worlds." There are three worlds of which Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor. This is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā://

"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries." [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]]

The word //sarva-loka// means "all three worlds," and the word //maheśvara// means "the supreme proprietor." Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of both material and spiritual worlds. The spiritual world is divided into two portions-Goloka Vṛndāvana and the Vaikuṇṭhas. The material world is a combination of universes unlimited in number.
