===== Purport =====

It is said that Indra, the King of heaven, is very lusty. Once he tactfully had sexual intercourse with the wife of a great sage, and when the sage learned about this, he cursed the lusty Indra with a curse that put vaginas all over his body. Being very ashamed, Indra fell down at the lotus feet of the great sage and begged his pardon. Being compassionate, the sage turned the vaginas into eyes; therefore Indra possesses hundreds and thousands of eyes all over his body. Just as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva have many faces, the King of heaven, Indra, has many eyes.
