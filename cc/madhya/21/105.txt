{{description>"Ornaments caress that body, but the transcendental body of Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful that it beautifies the ornaments He wears. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's body is said to be the ornament of ornaments. Despite the wonderful beauty of Kṛṣṇa, there is His three-curved style of standing, which beautifies that form. Above all these beautiful features, Kṛṣṇa's eyes dance and move obliquely, acting like arrows to pierce the minds of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the gopīs. When the arrow succeeds in hitting its target, their minds become agitated.}}
