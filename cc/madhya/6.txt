~~Title:Cc. Madhya 6: The Liberation of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya~~

====== The Liberation of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya ======

A summary of the Sixth Chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya// as follows: When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the temple of Jagannātha, He immediately fainted. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then took Him to his home. Meanwhile, Gopīnātha Ācārya, the brother-in-law of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, met Mukunda Datta and talked to him about Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of //sannyāsa// and His journey to Jagannātha Purī. After hearing about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's fainting and His being carried to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, people crowded there to see the Lord. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and other devotees then visited the Jagannātha temple, and when they came back to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to external consciousness. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya received everyone and distributed //mahā-prasāda// with great care. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then became acquainted with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and arranged accommodations at his aunt's house. His brother-in-law, Gopīnātha Ācārya, established that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself, but Sārvabhauma and his many disciples could not accept this. However, Gopīnātha Ācārya convinced Sārvabhauma that no one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead without being favored by Him. He proved by śāstric quotation, quotations from the revealed scriptures, that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself in person. Still, Sārvabhauma did not take these statements very seriously. Hearing all these arguments, Caitanya Mahāprabhu told His devotees that Sārvabhauma was His spiritual master and that whatever he said out of affection was for everyone's benefit.

When Sārvabhauma met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he asked Him to hear Vedānta philosophy from him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted this proposal, and for seven days He continuously heard Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explain the //Vedānta-sūtra.// However, the Lord remained very silent. Because of His silence, the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Him whether He was understanding the Vedānta philosophy, and the Lord replied, "Sir, I can understand Vedānta philosophy very clearly, but I cannot understand your explanations." There was then a discussion between the Bhaṭṭācārya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu concerning the authority of the Vedic scriptures, specifically the //Upaniṣads// and //Vedānta-sūtra.// The Bhaṭṭācārya was an impersonalist, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proved that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He proved that the conceptions of the Māyāvādī philosophers concerning the impersonal Absolute Truth are incorrect.

The Absolute Truth is neither impersonal nor without power. The greatest mistake made by the Māyāvādī philosophers is in conceiving the Absolute Truth to be impersonal and without energy. In all the //Vedas,// the unlimited energies of the Absolute Truth have been accepted. It is also accepted that the Absolute Truth has His transcendental, blissful, eternal form. According to the //Vedas,// the Lord and the living entity are equal in quality but different quantitatively. The real philosophy of the Absolute Truth states that the Lord and His creation are inconceivably and simultaneously one and different. The conclusion is that the Māyāvādī philosophers are actually atheists. There was much discussion on this issue between Sārvabhauma and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but despite all his endeavors, the Bhaṭṭācārya was defeated in the end.

At the request of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then explained the //ātmārāma// verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in eighteen different ways. When the Bhaṭṭācārya came to his senses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu disclosed His real identity. The Bhaṭṭācārya then recited one hundred verses in praise of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and offered his obeisances. After this, Gopīnātha Ācārya and all the others, having seen the wonderful potencies of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, became very joyful.

One morning after this incident, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu received some //prasāda// from Jagannātha and offered it to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. Without caring for formality, the Bhaṭṭācārya immediately partook of the //mahā-prasāda.// On another day, when the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu the best way to worship and meditate, the Lord advised him to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// On another day, the Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to change the reading of the //tat te 'nukampām// verse because he did not like the word //mukti-pada.// He wanted to substitute the word //bhakti-pada.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised Sārvabhauma not to change the reading of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because //mukti-pada// indicated the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. Having become a pure devotee, the Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Because the meaning is hazy, I still prefer //bhakti-pada.//" t this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the other inhabitants of Jagannātha Purī became very pleased. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya thus became a pure Vaiṣṇava, and the other learned scholars there followed him.

  ; [[.6:1|Cc. Madhya 6.1]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Gauracandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who converted the hardhearted Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, the reservoir of all bad logic, into a great devotee.

  ; [[.6:2|Cc. Madhya 6.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.6:3|Cc. Madhya 6.3]]
  : In ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went from Āṭhāranālā to the temple of Jagannātha. After seeing Lord Jagannātha, He became very restless due to love of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:4|Cc. Madhya 6.4]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went swiftly to embrace Lord Jagannātha, but when He entered the temple, He was so overwhelmed with love of Godhead that He fainted on the floor.

  ; [[.6:5|Cc. Madhya 6.5]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell down, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya happened to see Him. When the watchman threatened to beat the Lord, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya immediately forbade him.

  ; [[.6:6|Cc. Madhya 6.6]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was very much surprised to see the personal beauty of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as well as the transcendental transformations wrought on His body due to love of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:7|Cc. Madhya 6.7]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained unconscious for a long time. Meanwhile, the time for offering prasāda to Lord Jagannātha came, and the Bhaṭṭācārya tried to think of a remedy.

  ; [[.6:8|Cc. Madhya 6.8]]
  : While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was unconscious, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, with the help of the watchmen and some disciples, carried Him to his home and laid Him down in a very sanctified room.

  ; [[.6:9|Cc. Madhya 6.9]]
  : Examining the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sārvabhauma saw that His abdomen was not moving and that He was not breathing. Seeing His condition, the Bhaṭṭācārya became very anxious.

  ; [[.6:10|Cc. Madhya 6.10]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya then took a fine cotton swab and put it before the Lord's nostrils. When he saw the cotton move very slightly, he became hopeful.

  ; [[.6:11|Cc. Madhya 6.11]]
  : Sitting beside Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he thought, "This is a transcendental ecstatic transformation brought about by love of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.6:12|Cc. Madhya 6.12]]
  : Upon seeing the sign of sūddīpta-sāttvika, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya could immediately understand the transcendental ecstatic transformation in the body of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Such a sign takes place only in the bodies of eternally liberated devotees.

  ; [[.6:13|Cc. Madhya 6.13]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya considered, "The uncommon ecstatic symptoms of adhirūḍha-bhāva are appearing in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is very wonderful! How are they possible in the body of a human being?"

  ; [[.6:14|Cc. Madhya 6.14]]
  : While the Bhaṭṭācārya was thinking in this way at his home, all the devotees of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, headed by Nityānanda Prabhu, approached the Siṁha-dvāra [the entrance door of the temple].

  ; [[.6:15|Cc. Madhya 6.15]]
  : There the devotees heard the people talking about a mendicant who had come to Jagannātha Purī and seen the Deity of Jagannātha.

  ; [[.6:16|Cc. Madhya 6.16]]
  : The people said that the sannyāsī had fallen unconscious upon seeing the Deity of Lord Jagannātha. Because His consciousness did not return, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya had taken Him to his home.

  ; [[.6:17|Cc. Madhya 6.17]]
  : Hearing this, the devotees could understand that they were speaking of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Just then, Śrī Gopīnātha Ācārya arrived.

  ; [[.6:18|Cc. Madhya 6.18]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya was a resident of Nadīyā, the son-in-law of Viśārada and a devotee of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He knew the true identity of His Lordship.

  ; [[.6:19|Cc. Madhya 6.19]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya had previously been acquainted with Mukunda Datta, and when the Ācārya saw him at Jagannātha Purī, he was very much astonished.

  ; [[.6:20|Cc. Madhya 6.20]]
  : Mukunda Datta offered obeisances unto Gopīnātha Ācārya upon meeting him. Then the Ācārya embraced Mukunda Datta and inquired about news of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:21|Cc. Madhya 6.21]]
  : Mukunda Datta replied, "The Lord has already arrived here. We have come with Him."

  ; [[.6:22|Cc. Madhya 6.22]]
  : As soon as Gopīnātha Ācārya saw Nityānanda Prabhu, he offered his obeisances unto Him. In this way, meeting all the devotees, he asked about news of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu again and again.

  ; [[.6:23|Cc. Madhya 6.23]]
  : Mukunda Datta continued, "After accepting the sannyāsa order, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has come to Jagannātha Purī and has brought all of us with Him.

  ; [[.6:24|Cc. Madhya 6.24]]
  : "Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu left our company and walked ahead to see Lord Jagannātha. We have just arrived and are now looking for Him.

  ; [[.6:25|Cc. Madhya 6.25]]
  : "From the talk of the people in general, we have guessed that the Lord is now at the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:26|Cc. Madhya 6.26]]
  : "Upon seeing Lord Jagannātha, Caitanya Mahāprabhu became ecstatic and fell unconscious, and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has taken Him to his home in this condition.

  ; [[.6:27|Cc. Madhya 6.27]]
  : "Just as I was thinking of meeting you, by chance we have actually met.

  ; [[.6:28|Cc. Madhya 6.28]]
  : "First let us all go to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and see Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Later we shall come to see Lord Jagannātha."

  ; [[.6:29|Cc. Madhya 6.29]]
  : Hearing this and feeling very pleased, Gopīnātha Ācārya immediately took all the devotees with him and approached the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:30|Cc. Madhya 6.30]]
  : Arriving at the home of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, everyone saw the Lord lying unconscious. Seeing Him in this condition, Gopīnātha Ācārya became very unhappy, but at the same time he was happy just to see the Lord.

  ; [[.6:31|Cc. Madhya 6.31]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya permitted all the devotees to enter his house, and upon seeing Nityānanda Prabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya offered Him obeisances.

  ; [[.6:32|Cc. Madhya 6.32]]
  : Sārvabhauma met with all the devotees and offered them a proper welcome. They were all pleased to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:33|Cc. Madhya 6.33]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya then sent them all back to see Lord Jagannātha, and he asked his own son Candaneśvara to accompany them as a guide.

  ; [[.6:34|Cc. Madhya 6.34]]
  : Everyone was then very pleased to see the Deity of Lord Jagannātha. Lord Nityānanda in particular was overwhelmed with ecstasy.

  ; [[.6:35|Cc. Madhya 6.35]]
  : When Lord Nityānanda Prabhu nearly fainted, all the devotees caught Him and steadied Him. At that time, the priest of Lord Jagannātha brought a garland that had been offered to the Deity and offered it to Nityānanda Prabhu.

  ; [[.6:36|Cc. Madhya 6.36]]
  : Everyone was pleased to receive this garland worn by Lord Jagannātha. Afterwards they all returned to the place where Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was staying.

  ; [[.6:37|Cc. Madhya 6.37]]
  : All of the devotees then began to loudly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. Just before noon the Lord regained His consciousness.

  ; [[.6:38|Cc. Madhya 6.38]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu got up and very loudly chanted, "Hari! Hari!" Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was very pleased to see the Lord regain consciousness, and he took the dust of the Lord's lotus feet.

  ; [[.6:39|Cc. Madhya 6.39]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya informed all of them, "Please take your midday baths immediately. Today I shall offer you mahā-prasāda, the remnants of food offered to Lord Jagannātha."

  ; [[.6:40|Cc. Madhya 6.40]]
  : After bathing in the sea, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees returned very soon. The Lord then washed His feet and sat down on a carpet to take lunch.

  ; [[.6:41|Cc. Madhya 6.41]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya made arrangements to bring various kinds of mahā-prasāda from the Jagannātha temple. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then accepted lunch with great happiness.

  ; [[.6:42|Cc. Madhya 6.42]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu was offered special rice and first-class vegetables on golden plates. He thus took lunch in the company of His devotees.

  ; [[.6:43|Cc. Madhya 6.43]]
  : While Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya personally distributed the prasāda, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested him, "Please give Me only boiled vegetables.

  ; [[.6:44|Cc. Madhya 6.44]]
  : "You can offer the cakes and other preparations made with condensed milk to all the devotees." Hearing this, the Bhaṭṭācārya folded his hands and spoke as follows.

  ; [[.6:45|Cc. Madhya 6.45]]
  : "Today, all of you please try to taste the lunch just as Lord Jagannātha accepted it."

  ; [[.6:46|Cc. Madhya 6.46]]
  : After saying this, he made them all eat the various cakes and condensed-milk preparations. After feeding them, he offered them water to wash their hands, feet and mouths.

  ; [[.6:47|Cc. Madhya 6.47]]
  : Begging permission from Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then went with Gopīnātha Ācārya to take lunch. After finishing their lunch, they returned to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:48|Cc. Madhya 6.48]]
  : Offering his obeisances to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Namo nārāyaṇāya" ["I offer my obeisances to Nārāyaṇa"]." In return, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Kṛṣṇe matir astu" ["Let your attention be on Kṛṣṇa"]."

  ; [[.6:49|Cc. Madhya 6.49]]
  : Hearing these words, Sārvabhauma understood Lord Caitanya to be a Vaiṣṇava sannyāsī.

  ; [[.6:50|Cc. Madhya 6.50]]
  : Sārvabhauma then said to Gopīnātha Ācārya, "I want to know Caitanya Mahāprabhu's previous situation."

  ; [[.6:51|Cc. Madhya 6.51]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "There was a man named Jagannātha, who was a resident of Navadvīpa, and whose surname was Miśra Purandara.

  ; [[.6:52|Cc. Madhya 6.52]]
  : "Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the son of that Jagannātha Miśra, and His former name was Viśvambhara Miśra. He also happens to be the grandson of Nīlāmbara Cakravartī."

  ; [[.6:53|Cc. Madhya 6.53]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Nīlāmbara Cakravartī was a classmate of my father, Maheśvara Viśārada. I knew him as such.

  ; [[.6:54|Cc. Madhya 6.54]]
  : "Jagannātha Miśra Purandara was respected by my father. Thus because of their relationship with my father, I respect both Jagannātha Miśra and Nīlāmbara Cakravartī."

  ; [[.6:55|Cc. Madhya 6.55]]
  : Hearing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu belonged to the Nadīyā district, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya became very pleased and addressed the Lord as follows.

  ; [[.6:56|Cc. Madhya 6.56]]
  : "You are naturally respectable. Besides, You are a sannyāsī; thus I wish to become Your personal servant."

  ; [[.6:57|Cc. Madhya 6.57]]
  : As soon as Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard this from the Bhaṭṭācārya, He immediately remembered Lord Viṣṇu and began to speak humbly to him as follows.

  ; [[.6:58|Cc. Madhya 6.58]]
  : "Because you are a teacher of Vedānta philosophy, you are the master of all the people in the world and their well-wisher as well. You are also the benefactor of all kinds of sannyāsīs.

  ; [[.6:59|Cc. Madhya 6.59]]
  : "I am a young sannyāsī, and I actually have no knowledge of what is good and what is bad. Therefore I am taking shelter of you and accepting you as My spiritual master.

  ; [[.6:60|Cc. Madhya 6.60]]
  : "I have come here only to associate with you, and I am now taking shelter of you. Will you kindly maintain Me in all respects?

  ; [[.6:61|Cc. Madhya 6.61]]
  : "The incident that happened today was a great obstacle for Me, but you have kindly relieved Me of it."

  ; [[.6:62|Cc. Madhya 6.62]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "Do not go alone to see the Deity at the Jagannātha temple. It is better that You go with me or my men."

  ; [[.6:63|Cc. Madhya 6.63]]
  : The Lord said, "I shall never enter the temple but shall always view the Lord from the side of the Garuḍa-stambha."

  ; [[.6:64|Cc. Madhya 6.64]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then told Gopīnātha Ācārya, "Take Gosvāmījī and show Him Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.6:65|Cc. Madhya 6.65]]
  : "Also, the apartment belonging to my maternal aunt is in a very solitary place. Make all arrangements for Him to stay there."

  ; [[.6:66|Cc. Madhya 6.66]]
  : Thus Gopīnātha Ācārya took Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the residential quarters and showed Him where to find water, tubs and waterpots. Indeed, he arranged everything.

  ; [[.6:67|Cc. Madhya 6.67]]
  : The next day Gopīnātha Ācārya took Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to see the early rising of Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.6:68|Cc. Madhya 6.68]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya then took Mukunda Datta with him and went to Sārvabhauma's house. When they arrived, Sārvabhauma addressed Mukunda Datta as follows.

  ; [[.6:69|Cc. Madhya 6.69]]
  : "The sannyāsī is very meek and humble by nature, and His person is very beautiful to see. Consequently my affection for Him increases.

  ; [[.6:70|Cc. Madhya 6.70]]
  : "From which sampradāya has He accepted the sannyāsa order, and what is His name?"

  ; [[.6:71|Cc. Madhya 6.71]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "The Lord's name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, and His sannyāsa preceptor is the greatly fortunate Keśava Bhāratī."

  ; [[.6:72|Cc. Madhya 6.72]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, " 'Śrī Kṛṣṇa' is a very good name, but He belongs to the Bhāratī community. Therefore He is a second-class sannyāsī."

  ; [[.6:73|Cc. Madhya 6.73]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not rely on any external formality. There is no need for Him to accept the sannyāsa order from a superior sampradāya."

  ; [[.6:74|Cc. Madhya 6.74]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya inquired, "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is in His full-fledged youthful life. How can He keep the principles of sannyāsa?

  ; [[.6:75|Cc. Madhya 6.75]]
  : "I shall continuously recite Vedānta philosophy before Caitanya Mahāprabhu so that He may remain fixed in His renunciation and thus enter upon the path of monism."

  ; [[.6:76|Cc. Madhya 6.76]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then suggested, "If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would like, I could bring Him into a first-class sampradāya by offering Him saffron cloth and performing the reformatory process again."

  ; [[.6:77|Cc. Madhya 6.77]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya and Mukunda Datta became very unhappy when they heard this. Gopīnātha Ācārya therefore addressed Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya as follows.

  ; [[.6:78|Cc. Madhya 6.78]]
  : "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, you do not know the greatness of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are found in Him to the highest degree."

  ; [[.6:79|Cc. Madhya 6.79]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya continued, "Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is celebrated as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are ignorant in this connection find the conclusion of knowledgeable men very difficult to understand."

  ; [[.6:80|Cc. Madhya 6.80]]
  : The disciples of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya retaliated, "By what evidence do you conclude that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Lord?" Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "The statements of authorized ācāryas who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are proof."

  ; [[.6:81|Cc. Madhya 6.81]]
  : The disciples of the Bhaṭṭācārya said, "We derive knowledge of the Absolute Truth by logical hypothesis." Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "One cannot attain real knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by such logical hypothesis and argument."

  ; [[.6:82|Cc. Madhya 6.82]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya continued, "One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only by His mercy, not by guesswork or hypothesis."

  ; [[.6:83|Cc. Madhya 6.83]]
  : The Ācārya continued, "If one receives but a tiny bit of the Lord's favor by dint of devotional service, he can understand the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:84|Cc. Madhya 6.84]]
  : " 'My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate in order to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.' "

  ; [[.6:85-86|Cc. Madhya 6.85-86]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya then addressed Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya: "You are a great scholar and a teacher of may disciples. Indeed, there is no other scholar like you on earth. Nonetheless, because you are bereft of even a pinch of the Lord's mercy, you cannot understand Him, even though He is present in your home.

  ; [[.6:87|Cc. Madhya 6.87]]
  : "It is not your fault; it is the verdict of the scriptures. You cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by scholarship."

  ; [[.6:88|Cc. Madhya 6.88]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "My dear Gopīnātha Ācārya, please speak with great care. What is the proof that you have received the mercy of the Lord?"

  ; [[.6:89|Cc. Madhya 6.89]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya replied, "Knowledge of the summum bonum, the Absolute Truth, is evidence of the mercy of the Supreme Lord."

  ; [[.6:90|Cc. Madhya 6.90]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya continued, "You have seen the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu during His absorption in an ecstatic mood.

  ; [[.6:91|Cc. Madhya 6.91]]
  : "Despite directly perceiving the symptoms of the Supreme Lord in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, you cannot understand Him. This is commonly called illusion.

  ; [[.6:92|Cc. Madhya 6.92]]
  : "A person influenced by the external energy is called bahirmukha jana, a mundane person, because despite his perception, he cannot understand the real substance." Hearing Gopīnātha Ācārya say this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya smiled and began to speak as follows.

  ; [[.6:93|Cc. Madhya 6.93]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya said, "We are just having a discussion among friends and considering the points described in the scriptures. Do not become angry. I am simply speaking on the strength of the śāstras. Please don't take any offense.

  ; [[.6:94|Cc. Madhya 6.94]]
  : "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is certainly a great, uncommon devotee, but we cannot accept Him as an incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu because, according to śāstra, there is no incarnation in this Age of Kali.

  ; [[.6:95|Cc. Madhya 6.95]]
  : "Another name for Lord Viṣṇu is Triyuga because there is no incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu in Kali-yuga. Indeed, this is the verdict of revealed scriptures."

  ; [[.6:96|Cc. Madhya 6.96]]
  : Upon hearing this, Gopīnātha Ācārya became very unhappy. He said to the Bhaṭṭācārya, "You consider yourself the knower of all Vedic scriptures.

  : "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the Mahābhārata are the two most important Vedic scriptures, but you have paid no attention to their statements.

  ; [[.6:98|Cc. Madhya 6.98]]
  : "In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Mahābhārata it is stated that the Lord appears directly, but you say that in this age there is no manifestation or incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu.

  ; [[.6:99|Cc. Madhya 6.99]]
  : "In this Age of Kali there is no līlā-avatāra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is known as Triyuga. That is one of His holy names."

  ; [[.6:100|Cc. Madhya 6.100]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya continued, "There is certainly an incarnation in every age, and such an incarnation is called the yuga-avatāra. But your heart has become so hardened by logic and argument that you cannot consider all these facts.

  ; [[.6:101|Cc. Madhya 6.101]]
  : " 'In the past, your son has had bodies of three different colors, according to the age. These colors were white, red and yellow. In this age [Dvāpara-yuga] He has accepted a blackish body.'

  ; [[.6:102|Cc. Madhya 6.102]]
  : " 'In the Age of Kali, as well as in Dvāpara-yuga, the people offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by various mantras and observe the regulative principles of the supplementary Vedic literature. Now please hear of this from me.

  ; [[.6:103|Cc. Madhya 6.103]]
  : " 'In this Age of Kali, those who are intelligent perform the congregational chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appears in this age always describing the glories of Kṛṣṇa. That incarnation is yellowish in hue and is always associated with His plenary expansions [such as Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu] and personal expansions [such as Gadādhara], as well as His devotees and associates [such as Svarūpa Dāmodara].'

  ; [[.6:104|Cc. Madhya 6.104]]
  : " 'The Lord [in the incarnation of Gaurasundara] has a golden complexion. Indeed, His entire body, which is very nicely constituted, is like molten gold. Sandalwood pulp is smeared all over His body. He will take the fourth order of spiritual life [sannyāsa] and will be very self-controlled. He will be distinguished from Māyāvādī sannyāsīs in that He will be fixed in devotional service and will spread the saṅkīrtana movement.' "

  ; [[.6:105|Cc. Madhya 6.105]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya then said, "There is no need to quote so much evidence from the śāstras, for you are a very dry speculator. There is no need to sow seeds in barren land.

  ; [[.6:106|Cc. Madhya 6.106]]
  : "When the Lord will be pleased with you, you will also understand these conclusions and will quote from the śāstras.

  ; [[.6:107|Cc. Madhya 6.107]]
  : "The false arguments and philosophical word jugglery of your disciples are not faults of theirs. They have simply received the benediction of Māyāvāda philosophy.

  ; [[.6:108|Cc. Madhya 6.108]]
  : " 'I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is full of unlimited qualities and whose different potencies bring about agreement and disagreement between disputants. Thus the illusory energy again and again covers the self-realization of both disputants.'

  : " 'In almost all cases, whatever learned brāhmaṇas speak becomes accepted; nothing is impossible for one who takes shelter of My illusory energy and speaks under her influence.' "

  ; [[.6:110|Cc. Madhya 6.110]]
  : After hearing this from Gopīnātha Ācārya, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "First go to the place where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is staying and invite Him here with His associates. Ask Him on my account.

  ; [[.6:111|Cc. Madhya 6.111]]
  : "Take jagannātha-prasāda and first give it to Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates. After that, come back here and teach me well."

  ; [[.6:112|Cc. Madhya 6.112]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya was the brother-in-law of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya; therefore their relationship was very sweet and intimate. Under the circumstances, Gopīnātha Ācārya taught him by sometimes blaspheming him, sometimes praising him and sometimes laughing at him. This had been going on for some time.

  ; [[.6:113|Cc. Madhya 6.113]]
  : Śrīla Mukunda Datta felt very satisfied to hear the conclusive statements of Gopīnātha Ācārya, but he became very unhappy and angry to hear the statements put forward by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:114|Cc. Madhya 6.114]]
  : According to the instructions of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Gopīnātha Ācārya went to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and invited Him on the Bhaṭṭācārya's behalf.

  ; [[.6:115|Cc. Madhya 6.115]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya's statements were discussed before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Gopīnātha Ācārya and Mukunda Datta disapproved of the Bhaṭṭācārya's statements because they caused mental pain.

  ; [[.6:116|Cc. Madhya 6.116]]
  : Hearing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Do not speak like that. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has shown great affection and mercy toward Me.

  ; [[.6:117|Cc. Madhya 6.117]]
  : "Out of paternal affection for Me, he wants to protect Me and see that I follow the regulative principles of a sannyāsī. What fault is there in this?"

  ; [[.6:118|Cc. Madhya 6.118]]
  : The next morning, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya together visited the temple of Lord Jagannātha. Both of them were in a very pleasant mood.

  ; [[.6:119|Cc. Madhya 6.119]]
  : When they entered the temple, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya offered Caitanya Mahāprabhu a seat, while he himself sat down on the floor out of due respect for a sannyāsī.

  ; [[.6:120|Cc. Madhya 6.120]]
  : He then began to instruct Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu on Vedānta philosophy, and out of affection and devotion, he spoke to the Lord as follows.

  ; [[.6:121|Cc. Madhya 6.121]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Hearing Vedānta philosophy is a sannyāsī's main business. Therefore without hesitation You should study Vedānta philosophy, hearing it without cessation from a superior person."

  ; [[.6:122|Cc. Madhya 6.122]]
  : Lord Caitanya replied, "You are very merciful to Me, and therefore I think it is My duty to obey your order."

  ; [[.6:123|Cc. Madhya 6.123]]
  : Thus for seven days continually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu listened to the Vedānta philosophy expounded by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. However, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not say anything and did not indicate whether it was right or wrong. He simply sat there and listened to the Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:124|Cc. Madhya 6.124]]
  : On the eighth day, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "You have been listening to Vedānta philosophy from me continually for seven days.

  ; [[.6:125|Cc. Madhya 6.125]]
  : "You have simply been listening, fixed in Your silence. Since You do not say whether You think it is right or wrong, I cannot know whether You are actually understanding Vedānta philosophy or not."

  ; [[.6:126|Cc. Madhya 6.126]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "I am a fool, and consequently I do not study the Vedānta-sūtra. I am just trying to hear it from you because you have ordered Me.

  ; [[.6:127|Cc. Madhya 6.127]]
  : "Only for the sake of executing the duties of the renounced order of sannyāsa do I listen. Unfortunately, I cannot in the least understand the meaning you are presenting."

  ; [[.6:128|Cc. Madhya 6.128]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "I accept that You do not understand, yet even one who does not understand inquires about the subject matter.

  ; [[.6:129|Cc. Madhya 6.129]]
  : "You are hearing again and again, yet You keep silent. I cannot understand what is actually within Your mind."

  ; [[.6:130|Cc. Madhya 6.130]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then revealed His mind, saying, "I can understand the meaning of each sūtra very clearly, but your explanations have simply agitated My mind.

  ; [[.6:131|Cc. Madhya 6.131]]
  : "The meaning of the aphorisms in the Vedānta-sūtra contain clear purports in themselves, but other purports you presented simply covered the meaning of the sūtras like a cloud.

  ; [[.6:132|Cc. Madhya 6.132]]
  : "You do not explain the direct meaning of the Brahma-sūtras. Indeed, it appears that your business is to cover their real meaning."

  ; [[.6:133|Cc. Madhya 6.133]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "The Vedānta-sūtra is the summary of all the Upaniṣads; therefore whatever direct meaning is there in the Upaniṣads is also recorded in the Vedānta-sūtra, or Vyāsa-sūtra.

  ; [[.6:134|Cc. Madhya 6.134]]
  : "For each sūtra the direct meaning must be accepted without interpretation. However, you simply abandon the direct meaning and proceed with your imaginative interpretation.

  ; [[.6:135|Cc. Madhya 6.135]]
  : "Although there is other evidence, the evidence given in the Vedic version must be taken as foremost. Vedic versions understood directly are first-class evidence."

  ; [[.6:136|Cc. Madhya 6.136]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "Conchshells and cow dung are nothing but the bones and the stool of some living entities, but according to the Vedic version they are both considered very pure.

  ; [[.6:137|Cc. Madhya 6.137]]
  : "The Vedic statements are self-evident. Whatever is stated there must be accepted. If we interpret according to our own imagination, the authority of the Vedas is immediately lost."

  ; [[.6:138|Cc. Madhya 6.138]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "The Brahma-sūtra, compiled by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, is as radiant as the sun. One who tries to interpret its meaning simply covers that sunshine with a cloud.

  ; [[.6:139|Cc. Madhya 6.139]]
  : "All the Vedas and literature that strictly follows the Vedic principles explain that the Supreme Brahman is the Absolute Truth, the greatest of all, and a feature of the Supreme Lord.

  ; [[.6:140|Cc. Madhya 6.140]]
  : "Actually, the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences. You are trying to explain Him as impersonal and formless.

  ; [[.6:141|Cc. Madhya 6.141]]
  : "Wherever there is an impersonal description in the Vedas, the Vedas mean to establish that everything belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental and free of mundane characteristics."

  ; [[.6:142|Cc. Madhya 6.142]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, " 'Whatever Vedic mantras describe the Absolute Truth impersonally only prove in the end that the Absolute Truth is a person. The Supreme Lord is understood in two features-impersonal and personal. If one considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead in both features, he can actually understand the Absolute Truth. He knows that the personal understanding is stronger because we see that everything is full of variety. No one can see anything that is not full of variety.'

  ; [[.6:143|Cc. Madhya 6.143]]
  : "Everything in the cosmic manifestation emanates from the Absolute Truth. It remains in the Absolute Truth, and after annihilation it again enters the Absolute Truth.

  ; [[.6:144|Cc. Madhya 6.144]]
  : "The personal features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are categorized in three cases-namely ablative, instrumental and locative."

  ; [[.6:145-146|Cc. Madhya 6.145-146]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "When the Supreme Personality of Godhead wished to become many, He glanced over the material energy. Before the creation there were no mundane eyes or mind; therefore the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth's mind and eyes is confirmed.

  ; [[.6:147|Cc. Madhya 6.147]]
  : "The word 'Brahman' indicates the complete Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.

  ; [[.6:148|Cc. Madhya 6.148]]
  : "The confidential meaning of the Vedas is not easily understood by common men; therefore that meaning is supplemented by the words of the Purāṇas.

  ; [[.6:149|Cc. Madhya 6.149]]
  : " 'How greatly fortunate are Nanda Mahārāja, the cowherd men and all the inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi! There is no limit to their fortune, because the Absolute Truth, the source of transcendental bliss, the eternal Supreme Brahman, has become their friend.'

  ; [[.6:150|Cc. Madhya 6.150]]
  : "The Vedic 'apāṇi-pāda' mantra rejects material hands and legs, yet it states that the Lord goes very fast and accepts everything offered to Him.

  ; [[.6:151|Cc. Madhya 6.151]]
  : "All these mantras confirm that the Absolute Truth is personal, but the Māyāvādīs, throwing away the direct meaning, interpret the Absolute Truth as impersonal.

  ; [[.6:152|Cc. Madhya 6.152]]
  : "Are you describing as formless that Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is complete with six transcendental opulences?

  ; [[.6:153|Cc. Madhya 6.153]]
  : ''The Supreme Personality of Godhead has three primary potencies. Are you trying to prove that He has no potencies?

  ; [[.6:154|Cc. Madhya 6.154]]
  : " 'The internal potency of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, is spiritual, as verified by the śāstras. There is another spiritual potency, known as kṣetra-jña, or the living entity. The third potency, which is known as nescience, makes the living entity godless and fills him with fruitive activity.

  ; [[.6:155|Cc. Madhya 6.155]]
  : " 'O King, the kṣetra-jña-śakti is the living entity. Although he has the facility to live in either the material or the spiritual world, he suffers the threefold miseries of material existence because he is influenced by the avidyā [nescience] potency, which covers his constitutional position.

  ; [[.6:156|Cc. Madhya 6.156]]
  : " 'This living entity, covered by the influence of nescience, exists in different forms in the material condition. O King, he is thus proportionately freed from the influence of material energy, to a greater or lesser degree.'

  ; [[.6:157|Cc. Madhya 6.157]]
  : " 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha. This means that He originally has three potencies---the pleasure potency, the potency of eternality and the potency of knowledge. Together these are called the cit potency, and they are present in full in the Supreme Lord. For the living entities, who are part and parcel of the Lord, the pleasure potency in the material world is sometimes displeasing and sometimes mixed. This is not the case with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because He is not under the influence of the material energy or its modes.'

  ; [[.6:158|Cc. Madhya 6.158]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form is full of eternity, knowledge and bliss. The spiritual potency in these three portions [sat, cit and ānanda] assumes three different forms.

  ; [[.6:159|Cc. Madhya 6.159]]
  : "The three portions of the spiritual potency are called hlādinī [the bliss portion], sandhinī [the eternity portion] and samvit [the knowledge portion]. We accept knowledge of these as full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:160|Cc. Madhya 6.160]]
  : "The spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead also appears in three phases-internal, marginal and external. These are all engaged in His devotional service in love.

  ; [[.6:161|Cc. Madhya 6.161]]
  : "In His spiritual potency, the Supreme Lord enjoys six kinds of opulence. You do not accept this spiritual potency, and this is due to your great impudence.

  ; [[.6:162|Cc. Madhya 6.162]]
  : "The Lord is the master of the potencies, and the living entity is the servant of them. That is the difference between the Lord and the living entity. However, you declare that the Lord and the living entities are one and the same.

  ; [[.6:163|Cc. Madhya 6.163]]
  : "In the Bhagavad-gītā the living entity is established as the marginal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet you say that the living entity is completely different from the Lord.

  : " 'Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego are My eightfold separated energies.

  : " 'Besides these inferior energies, which are material, there is another energy, a spiritual energy, and this is the living being, O mighty-armed one. The entire material world is sustained by the living entities.'

  ; [[.6:166|Cc. Madhya 6.166]]
  : "The transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is complete in eternity, cognizance and bliss. However, you describe this transcendental form as a product of material goodness.

  ; [[.6:167|Cc. Madhya 6.167]]
  : "One who does not accept the transcendental form of the Lord is certainly an agnostic. Such a person should be neither seen nor touched. Indeed, he is subject to be punished by Yamarāja.

  ; [[.6:168|Cc. Madhya 6.168]]
  : "The Buddhists do not recognize the authority of the Vedas; therefore they are considered agnostics. However, those who have taken shelter of the Vedic scriptures yet preach agnosticism in accordance with the Māyāvāda philosophy are certainly more dangerous than the Buddhists.

  ; [[.6:169|Cc. Madhya 6.169]]
  : "Śrīla Vyāsadeva presented Vedānta philosophy for the deliverance of conditioned souls, but if one hears the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, everything is spoiled.

  ; [[.6:170|Cc. Madhya 6.170]]
  : "The Vedānta-sūtra aims at establishing that the cosmic manifestation has come into being by the transformation of the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:171|Cc. Madhya 6.171]]
  : "The touchstone, after touching iron, produces volumes of gold without being changed. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself as the cosmic manifestation by His inconceivable potency, yet He remains unchanged in His eternal, transcendental form.

  ; [[.6:172|Cc. Madhya 6.172]]
  : "Śaṅkarācārya's theory states that the Absolute Truth is transformed. By accepting this theory, the Māyāvādī philosophers denigrate Śrīla Vyāsadeva by accusing him of error. They thus find fault in the Vedānta-sūtra and interpret it to try to establish the theory of illusion.

  ; [[.6:173|Cc. Madhya 6.173]]
  : "The theory of illusion can be applied only when the living entity identifies himself with the body. As far as the cosmic manifestation is concerned, it cannot be called false, although it is certainly temporary.

  ; [[.6:174|Cc. Madhya 6.174]]
  : "The transcendental vibration oṁkāra is the sound form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All Vedic knowledge and this cosmic manifestation are produced from this sound representation of the Supreme Lord.

  ; [[.6:175|Cc. Madhya 6.175]]
  : "The subsidiary vibration tat tvam asi ["you are the same"] is meant for the understanding of the living entity, but the principal vibration is oṁkāra. Not caring for oṁkāra, Śaṅkarācārya has stressed the vibration tat tvam asi."

  ; [[.6:176|Cc. Madhya 6.176]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu criticized Śaṅkarācārya's Śārīraka-bhāṣya as imaginary, and He pointed out hundreds of faults in it. To defend Śaṅkarācārya, however, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya presented unlimited opposition.

  ; [[.6:177|Cc. Madhya 6.177]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya presented various types of false arguments with pseudo logic and tried to defeat his opponent in many ways. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refuted all these arguments and established His own conviction.

  ; [[.6:178|Cc. Madhya 6.178]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the central point of all relationships, acting in devotional service to Him is one's real occupation, and the attainment of love of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. These three subject matters are described in the Vedic literature.

  ; [[.6:179|Cc. Madhya 6.179]]
  : "If one tries to explain the Vedic literature in a different way, he is indulging in imagination. Any interpretation of the self-evident Vedic version is simply imaginary.

  ; [[.6:180|Cc. Madhya 6.180]]
  : "Actually there is no fault on the part of Śaṅkarācārya. He simply carried out the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He had to imagine some kind of interpretation, and therefore he presented a kind of Vedic scripture that is full of atheism.

  ; [[.6:181|Cc. Madhya 6.181]]
  : " '[Addressing Lord Śiva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead said,] Please make the general populace averse to Me by imagining your own interpretation of the Vedas. Also, cover Me in such a way that people will take more interest in advancing material civilization just to propagate a population bereft of spiritual knowledge.'

  ; [[.6:182|Cc. Madhya 6.182]]
  : "[Lord Śiva informed the Goddess Durgā, the superintendent of the material world,] 'In the Age of Kali I take the form of a brāhmaṇa and explain the Vedas through false scriptures in an atheistic way, similar to Buddhist philosophy.' "

  ; [[.6:183|Cc. Madhya 6.183]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya became very astonished upon hearing this. He became stunned and said nothing.

  ; [[.6:184|Cc. Madhya 6.184]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told him, "Do not be astonished. Actually, devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the highest perfection of human activity.

  ; [[.6:185|Cc. Madhya 6.185]]
  : "Even the self-satisfied sages perform devotional service to the Supreme Lord. Such are the transcendental qualities of the Lord. They are full of inconceivable spiritual potency.

  ; [[.6:186|Cc. Madhya 6.186]]
  : " 'Those who are self-satisfied and unattracted by external material desires are also attracted to the loving service of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose qualities are transcendental and whose activities are wonderful. Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is called Kṛṣṇa because He has such transcendentally attractive features.' "

  ; [[.6:187|Cc. Madhya 6.187]]
  : After hearing the ātmārāma verse, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya addressed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "My dear Sir, please explain this verse. I have a great desire to hear Your explanation of it."

  ; [[.6:188|Cc. Madhya 6.188]]
  : The Lord replied, "First let Me hear your explanation. After that, I shall try to explain what little I know."

  ; [[.6:189|Cc. Madhya 6.189]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then began to explain the ātmārāma verse, and according to the principles of logic, he put forward various propositions.

  ; [[.6:190|Cc. Madhya 6.190]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya explained the ātmārāma verse in nine different ways on the basis of scripture. After hearing his explanation, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, smiling a little, began to speak.

  ; [[.6:191|Cc. Madhya 6.191]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, you are exactly like Bṛhaspati, the priest of the heavenly kingdom. Indeed, no one within this world has the power to explain the scriptures in such a way.

  ; [[.6:192|Cc. Madhya 6.192]]
  : "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, you have certainly explained this verse by the prowess of your vast learning, but you should know that, besides this scholarly explanation, there is another purport to this verse."

  ; [[.6:193|Cc. Madhya 6.193]]
  : Upon the request of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to explain the verse, without touching upon the nine explanations given by the Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:194|Cc. Madhya 6.194]]
  : There are eleven words in the ātmārāma verse, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained each word, one after the other.

  ; [[.6:195|Cc. Madhya 6.195]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu took each word specifically and combined it with the word "ātmārāma." He thus explained the word "ātmārāma" in eighteen different ways.

  ; [[.6:196|Cc. Madhya 6.196]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different potencies and His transcendental qualities all have inconceivable prowess. It is not possible to explain them fully.

  ; [[.6:197|Cc. Madhya 6.197]]
  : "These three items attract the mind of a perfect student engaged in spiritual activities and overcome all other processes of spiritual activity."

  ; [[.6:198|Cc. Madhya 6.198]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the meaning of the verse by giving evidence concerning Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four ṛṣis Sanaka, Sanat-kumāra, Sanātana and Sanandana. Thus the Lord gave various meanings and explanations.

  ; [[.6:199|Cc. Madhya 6.199]]
  : Upon hearing Caitanya Mahāprabhu's explanation of the ātmārāma verse, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was struck with wonder. He then understood Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be Kṛṣṇa in person, and he thus condemned himself in the following words.

  ; [[.6:200|Cc. Madhya 6.200]]
  : "Caitanya Mahāprabhu is certainly Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Because I could not understand Him and was very proud of my own learning, I have committed many offenses."

  ; [[.6:201|Cc. Madhya 6.201]]
  : When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya denounced himself as an offender and took shelter of the Lord, the Lord desired to show him mercy.

  ; [[.6:202|Cc. Madhya 6.202]]
  : To show him mercy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu allowed him to see His Viṣṇu form. Thus He immediately assumed four hands.

  ; [[.6:203|Cc. Madhya 6.203]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu first showed him the four-handed form and then appeared before him in His original form of Kṛṣṇa, with a blackish complexion and a flute to His lips.

  ; [[.6:204|Cc. Madhya 6.204]]
  : When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya saw the form of Lord Kṛṣṇa manifested in Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he immediately fell down flat to offer Him obeisances. Then he stood up and with folded hands began to offer prayers.

  ; [[.6:205|Cc. Madhya 6.205]]
  : By the mercy of the Lord, all truths were revealed to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, and he could understand the importance of chanting the holy name and distributing love of Godhead everywhere.

  ; [[.6:206|Cc. Madhya 6.206]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya composed one hundred verses in a very short time. Indeed, not even Bṛhaspati, the priest of the heavenly planets, could compose verses as quickly.

  ; [[.6:207|Cc. Madhya 6.207]]
  : After hearing the one hundred verses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu happily embraced Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was immediately overwhelmed in ecstatic love of Godhead and fell unconscious.

  ; [[.6:208|Cc. Madhya 6.208]]
  : Out of ecstatic love of God, the Bhaṭṭācārya shed tears, and his body was stunned. He exhibited an ecstatic mood, and he perspired, shook and trembled. He sometimes danced, sometimes chanted, sometimes cried and sometimes fell down to touch the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:209|Cc. Madhya 6.209]]
  : While Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was in this ecstasy. Gopīnātha Ācārya was very pleased, The associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu all laughed to see the Bhaṭṭācārya dance so.

  ; [[.6:210|Cc. Madhya 6.210]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya told Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Sir, You have brought all this upon Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya."

  ; [[.6:211|Cc. Madhya 6.211]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "You are a devotee. Because of your association, Lord Jagannātha has shown him mercy."

  ; [[.6:212|Cc. Madhya 6.212]]
  : After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pacified the Bhaṭṭācārya, and when he was quieted, he offered many prayers to the Lord.

  ; [[.6:213|Cc. Madhya 6.213]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "My dear Sir, You have delivered the entire world, but that is not a very great task. However, You have also delivered me, and that is certainly the work of very wonderful powers.

  ; [[.6:214|Cc. Madhya 6.214]]
  : "I had become dull-headed due to reading too many books on logic. Consequently I had become like an iron bar. Nonetheless, You have melted me, and therefore Your influence is very great."

  ; [[.6:215|Cc. Madhya 6.215]]
  : After hearing the prayers offered by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to His residence, and the Bhaṭṭācārya, through Gopīnātha Ācārya, induced the Lord to accept lunch there.

  ; [[.6:216|Cc. Madhya 6.216]]
  : Early the following morning, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to see Lord Jagannātha in the temple, and He saw the Lord rise from His bed.

  ; [[.6:217|Cc. Madhya 6.217]]
  : The priest there presented Him with garlands and prasāda that had been offered to Lord Jagannātha. This pleased Caitanya Mahāprabhu very much.

  ; [[.6:218|Cc. Madhya 6.218]]
  : Carefully tying the prasāda and garlands in a cloth, Caitanya Mahāprabhu hastened to the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:219|Cc. Madhya 6.219]]
  : He arrived at the Bhaṭṭācārya's house a little before sunrise, just when the Bhaṭṭācārya was arising from bed.

  ; [[.6:220|Cc. Madhya 6.220]]
  : As Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya arose from bed, he distinctly chanted, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa." Lord Caitanya was very pleased to hear him chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.6:221|Cc. Madhya 6.221]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya noticed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu outside, and with great haste he went to Him and offered prayers unto His lotus feet.

  ; [[.6:222|Cc. Madhya 6.222]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya offered a carpet for the Lord to sit upon, and both of them sat there. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu opened the prasāda and placed it in the hands of the Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:223|Cc. Madhya 6.223]]
  : At that time the Bhaṭṭācārya had not even washed his mouth, nor had he taken his bath or finished his morning duties. Nonetheless, he was very pleased to receive the prasāda of Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.6:224|Cc. Madhya 6.224]]
  : By the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the dullness in the mind of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was eradicated. After reciting the following two verses, he ate the prasāda offered to him.

  ; [[.6:225|Cc. Madhya 6.225]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya said, " 'One should eat the mahā-prasāda of the Lord immediately upon receiving it, even though it is dried up, stale or brought from a distant country. One should consider neither time nor place.

  ; [[.6:226|Cc. Madhya 6.226]]
  : " 'The prasāda of Lord Kṛṣṇa is to be eaten by gentlemen as soon as it is received; there should be no hesitation. There are no regulative principles concerning time and place. This is the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' "

  ; [[.6:227|Cc. Madhya 6.227]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased to see this. He became ecstatic in love of Godhead and embraced Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.6:228|Cc. Madhya 6.228]]
  : The Lord and the servant embraced each other and began to dance. Simply by touching each other, they became ecstatic.

  ; [[.6:229|Cc. Madhya 6.229]]
  : As they danced and embraced, spiritual symptoms manifested in their bodies. They perspired, trembled and shed tears, and the Lord began to speak in His ecstasy.

  ; [[.6:230|Cc. Madhya 6.230]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Today I have conquered the three worlds very easily. Today I have ascended to the spiritual world."

  ; [[.6:231|Cc. Madhya 6.231]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "I think that today all My desires have been fulfilled because I see that Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has acquired faith in the mahā-prasāda of Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.6:232|Cc. Madhya 6.232]]
  : "Indeed, today you have undoubtedly taken shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa, without reservation, has become very merciful toward you.

  ; [[.6:233|Cc. Madhya 6.233]]
  : "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, today you have been released from material bondage in the bodily conception of life; you have cut to pieces the shackles of the illusory energy.

  ; [[.6:234|Cc. Madhya 6.234]]
  : "Today your mind has become fit to take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa because, surpassing the Vedic regulative principles, you have eaten the remnants of food offered to the Lord.

  ; [[.6:235|Cc. Madhya 6.235]]
  : " 'When a person unreservedly takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the unlimited, merciful Lord bestows His causeless mercy upon him. Thus he can pass over the insurmountable ocean of nescience. Those whose intelligence is fixed in the bodily conception, who think, "I am this body," are fit food for dogs and jackals. The Supreme Lord never bestows His mercy upon such people.' "

  ; [[.6:236|Cc. Madhya 6.236]]
  : After speaking to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya in this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to His residence. From that day on, the Bhaṭṭācārya was free because his false pride had been dismantled.

  ; [[.6:237|Cc. Madhya 6.237]]
  : From that day on, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya did not know anything but the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and from that day he could explain the revealed scriptures only in accordance with the process of devotional service.

  ; [[.6:238|Cc. Madhya 6.238]]
  : Seeing that Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was firmly fixed in the cult of Vaiṣṇavism, Gopīnātha Ācārya, his brother-in-law, began to dance, clap his hands and chant "Hari! Hari!"

  ; [[.6:239|Cc. Madhya 6.239]]
  : The next day, the Bhaṭṭācārya went to visit the temple of Lord Jagannātha, but before he reached the temple, he went to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:240|Cc. Madhya 6.240]]
  : When he met Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya fell down flat to offer Him respects. After offering various prayers to Him, he spoke of his previous bad disposition with great humility.

  ; [[.6:241|Cc. Madhya 6.241]]
  : Then the Bhaṭṭācārya asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Which item is most important in the execution of devotional service?" The Lord replied that the most important item was the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:242|Cc. Madhya 6.242]]
  : " 'In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy, the only means of deliverence is the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.' "

  ; [[.6:243|Cc. Madhya 6.243]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very elaborately explained the harer nāma verse of the Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa, and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was struck with wonder to hear His explanation.

  ; [[.6:244|Cc. Madhya 6.244]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya reminded Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, what I foretold to you has now taken place."

  ; [[.6:245|Cc. Madhya 6.245]]
  : Offering his obeisances to Gopīnātha Ācārya, the Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Because I am related to you and you are a devotee, by your mercy the Lord has shown mercy to me.

  ; [[.6:246|Cc. Madhya 6.246]]
  : "You are a first-class devotee, whereas I am in the darkness of logical arguments. Because of your relationship with the Lord, the Lord has bestowed His benediction upon me."

  ; [[.6:247|Cc. Madhya 6.247]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased with this humble statement. After embracing the Bhaṭṭācārya, He said, "Now go see Lord Jagannātha in the temple."

  ; [[.6:248|Cc. Madhya 6.248]]
  : After visiting the temple of Lord Jagannātha, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya returned home with Jagadānanda and Dāmodara.

  ; [[.6:249|Cc. Madhya 6.249]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya brought large quantities of excellent food remnants blessed by Lord Jagannātha. All this prasāda was given to his own brāhmaṇa servant, along with Jagadānanda and Dāmodara.

  ; [[.6:250|Cc. Madhya 6.250]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then composed two verses on the leaf of a palm tree. Giving the palm leaf to Jagadānanda Prabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya requested him to deliver it to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:251|Cc. Madhya 6.251]]
  : Jagadānanda and Dāmodara then returned to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, bringing Him both the prasāda and the palm leaf on which the verses were composed. But Mukunda Datta took the palm leaf from the hands of Jagadānanda before he could deliver it to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:252|Cc. Madhya 6.252]]
  : Mukunda Datta then copied the two verses on the wall outside the room. After this, Jagadānanda took the palm leaf from Mukunda Datta and delivered it to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:253|Cc. Madhya 6.253]]
  : As soon as Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu read the two verses, He immediately tore up the palm leaf. However, all the devotees read these verses on the outside wall, and they all kept them within their hearts. The verses read as follows.

  ; [[.6:254|Cc. Madhya 6.254]]
  : "Let me take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who has descended in the form of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach us real knowledge, His devotional service and detachment from whatever does not foster Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental mercy. Let me surrender unto His lotus feet.

  ; [[.6:255|Cc. Madhya 6.255]]
  : "Let my consciousness, which is like a honeybee, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has just now appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach the ancient system of devotional service to Himself. This system had almost been lost due to the influence of time."

  ; [[.6:256|Cc. Madhya 6.256]]
  : These two verses composed by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya will always declare his name and fame as loudly as a pounding drum because they have become pearl necklaces around the necks of all devotees.

  ; [[.6:257|Cc. Madhya 6.257]]
  : Indeed, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya became an unalloyed devotee of Caitanya Mahāprabhu; he did not know anything but the service of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:258|Cc. Madhya 6.258]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya always chanted the holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, son of mother Śacī and reservoir of all good qualities. Indeed, chanting the holy names became his meditation.

  ; [[.6:259|Cc. Madhya 6.259]]
  : One day Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya came before Caitanya Mahāprabhu and, after offering obeisances, began to recite a verse.

  ; [[.6:260|Cc. Madhya 6.260]]
  : He began to quote one of Lord Brahmā's prayers from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but he changed two syllables at the end of the verse.

  ; [[.6:261|Cc. Madhya 6.261]]
  : [The verse read:] "One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You is certainly a bona fide candidate for becoming Your unalloyed devotee."

  ; [[.6:262|Cc. Madhya 6.262]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately pointed out, "In that verse the word is 'mukti-pade,' but you have changed it to 'bhakti-pade.' What is your intention?"

  ; [[.6:263|Cc. Madhya 6.263]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "The awakening of pure love of Godhead, which is the result of devotional service, far surpasses liberation from material bondage. For those averse to devotional service, merging into the Brahman effulgence is a kind of punishment."

  ; [[.6:264-265|Cc. Madhya 6.264-265]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "The impersonalists, who do not accept the transcendental form of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the demons, who are always engaged in blaspheming and fighting with Him, are punished by being merged into the Brahman effulgence. But that does not happen to the person engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:266|Cc. Madhya 6.266]]
  : "There are five kinds of liberation: sālokya, sāmīpya, sārūpya, sārṣṭi and sāyujya.

  ; [[.6:267|Cc. Madhya 6.267]]
  : "If there is a chance to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a pure devotee sometimes accepts the sālokya, sārūpya, sāmīpya or sārṣṭi forms of liberation, but never sāyujya.

  ; [[.6:268|Cc. Madhya 6.268]]
  : "A pure devotee does not like even to hear about sāyujya-mukti, which inspires him with fear and hatred. Indeed, the pure devotee would rather go to hell than merge into the effulgence of the Lord."

  ; [[.6:269|Cc. Madhya 6.269]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "There are two kinds of sāyujya-mukti: merging into the Brahman effulgence and merging into the personal body of the Lord. Merging into the Lord's body is even more abominable than merging into His effulgence."

  ; [[.6:270|Cc. Madhya 6.270]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya concluded, " 'Even though he is offered all kinds of liberation, the pure devotee does not accept them. He is fully satisfied engaging in the service of the Lord.' "

  ; [[.6:271|Cc. Madhya 6.271]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "The word 'mukti-pade' has another meaning. Mukti-pada directly refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.6:272|Cc. Madhya 6.272]]
  : "All kinds of liberation exist under the feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is known as mukti-pada. According to another meaning, mukti is the ninth subject, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the shelter of liberation.

  ; [[.6:273|Cc. Madhya 6.273]]
  : "Since I can understand Kṛṣṇa according to these two meanings," Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "what point is there in changing the verse?" Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "I was not able to give that reading to the verse.

  ; [[.6:274|Cc. Madhya 6.274]]
  : "Although Your explanation is correct, it should not be used because there is ambiguity in the word 'mukti-pada.'

  ; [[.6:275|Cc. Madhya 6.275]]
  : "The word 'mukti' refers to five kinds of liberation. Usually its direct meaning conveys the idea of becoming one with the Lord.

  ; [[.6:276|Cc. Madhya 6.276]]
  : "The very sound of the word 'mukti' immediately induces hate and fear, but when we say the word 'bhakti,' we naturally feel transcendental bliss within the mind."

  ; [[.6:277|Cc. Madhya 6.277]]
  : Upon hearing this explanation, the Lord began to laugh and, with great pleasure, immediately embraced Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya very firmly.

  ; [[.6:278|Cc. Madhya 6.278]]
  : Indeed, that very person who was accustomed to reading and teaching Māyāvāda philosophy was now even hating the word "mukti." This was possible only by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.6:279|Cc. Madhya 6.279]]
  : As long as it does not turn iron into gold by its touch, no one can recognize an unknown stone to be a touchstone.

  ; [[.6:280|Cc. Madhya 6.280]]
  : Upon seeing transcendental Vaiṣṇavism in Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, everyone could understand that Lord Caitanya was none other than Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

  ; [[.6:281|Cc. Madhya 6.281]]
  : After this incident, all the inhabitants of Jagannātha Purī, headed by Kāśī Miśra, came to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:282|Cc. Madhya 6.282]]
  : Later I shall describe how Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya always engaged in the service of the Lord.

  ; [[.6:283|Cc. Madhya 6.283]]
  : I shall also describe in full detail how Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya perfectly rendered service to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by offering Him alms.

  ; [[.6:284-285|Cc. Madhya 6.284-285]]
  : If one hears with faith and love these pastimes concerning Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's meeting with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, he very soon is freed from the net of speculation and fruitive activity and attains the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's lotus feet.

  ; [[.6:286|Cc. Madhya 6.286]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
