~~Title:Cc. Madhya 3: Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s Stay at the House of Advaita Ācārya~~

====== Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s Stay at the House of Advaita Ācārya ======

In his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the Third Chapter. After accepting the //sannyāsa// order at Katwa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu traveled continuously for three days in Rāḍha-deśa and, by the trick of Nityānanda Prabhu, eventually came to the western side of Śāntipura. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was induced to believe that the river Ganges was the Yamunā. When He was worshiping the sacred river, Advaita Prabhu arrived in a boat. Advaita Prabhu asked Him to take His bath in the Ganges and took Him to His (Advaita's) house. There all the Navadvīpa devotees, along with mother Śacīdevī, came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This house was located at Śāntipura. Mother Śacīdevī cooked for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, and at that time there were many joking exchanges between Advaita Prabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. In the evening there was a mass //saṅkīrtana// at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and mother Śacīdevī gave Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu permission to leave. She requested Him to make Jagannātha Purī, Nīlācala, His headquarters. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu granted His mother's request and, followed by Nityānanda, Mukunda, Jagadānanda and Dāmodara, left Śāntipura. Bidding farewell to mother Śacīdevī, they all proceeded toward Jagannātha Purī, following the path of Chatrabhoga.

  ; [[.3:1|Cc. Madhya 3.1]]
  : After accepting the sannyāsa order of life, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of intense love for Kṛṣṇa, wanted to go to Vṛndāvana, but apparently by mistake He wandered in the Rāḍha-deśa. Later He arrived at Śāntipura and enjoyed Himself there with His devotees. I offer my respectful obeisances to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.3:2|Cc. Madhya 3.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Nityānanda! All glories to Advaita Prabhu! And all glories to the devotees of Lord Caitanya, headed by Śrīvāsa!

  ; [[.3:3|Cc. Madhya 3.3]]
  : At the end of His twenty-fourth year, in the month of Māgha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the sannyāsa order during the waxing period of the moon.

  ; [[.3:4|Cc. Madhya 3.4]]
  : After accepting the sannyāsa order, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of intense love for Kṛṣṇa, started for Vṛndāvana. However, He mistakenly wandered about in a trance continuously for three days in the tract of land known as Rāḍha-deśa.

  ; [[.3:5|Cc. Madhya 3.5]]
  : Passing through the tract of land known as Rāḍha-deśa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recited the following verse in ecstasy.

  ; [[.3:6|Cc. Madhya 3.6]]
  : "[As a brāhmaṇa from Avantī-deśa said:] 'I shall cross over the insurmountable ocean of nescience by being firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This was approved by the previous ācāryas, who were fixed in firm devotion to the Lord, Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

  ; [[.3:7|Cc. Madhya 3.7]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved the purport of this verse on account of the determination of the mendicant devotee to engage in the service of Lord Mukunda. He gave His approval of this verse, indicating that it was very good.

  ; [[.3:8|Cc. Madhya 3.8]]
  : The real purpose of accepting sannyāsa is to dedicate oneself to the service of Mukunda. By serving Mukunda, one can actually be liberated from the bondage of material existence.

  ; [[.3:9|Cc. Madhya 3.9]]
  : After accepting the sannyāsa order, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to go to Vṛndāvana and engage Himself wholly and solely in the service of Mukunda in a solitary place.

  ; [[.3:10|Cc. Madhya 3.10]]
  : As Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was enroute to Vṛndāvana, all the ecstatic symptoms became manifest, and He did not know in which direction He was going, nor did He know whether it was day or night.

  ; [[.3:11|Cc. Madhya 3.11]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went toward Vṛndāvana, Nityānanda Prabhu, Candraśekhara and Prabhu Mukunda followed Him.

  ; [[.3:12|Cc. Madhya 3.12]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed through Rāḍha-deśa, whoever saw Him in ecstasy exclaimed, "Hari! Hari!" As they chanted this with the Lord, all the unhappiness of material existence diminished.

  ; [[.3:13|Cc. Madhya 3.13]]
  : All the cowherd boys who saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passing joined with Him and began to shout loudly, "Hari! Hari!"

  ; [[.3:14|Cc. Madhya 3.14]]
  : When He heard all the cowherd boys also chanting "Hari! Hari!" Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased. He approached them, put His hand on their heads and said, "Go on chanting like that."

  ; [[.3:15|Cc. Madhya 3.15]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus blessed them all, saying that they were all fortunate. In this way He praised them, and He felt very successful because they chanted the holy name of Lord Hari.

  ; [[.3:16|Cc. Madhya 3.16]]
  : Calling all the boys in confidence and telling a reasonable story, Nityānanda Prabhu instructed them as follows.

  ; [[.3:17|Cc. Madhya 3.17]]
  : "If Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asks you about the path to Vṛndāvana, please show Him the path on the bank of the Ganges instead."

  ; [[.3:18-19|Cc. Madhya 3.18-19]]
  : When the cowherd boys were questioned by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu about the path to Vṛndāvana, the boys showed Him the path on the bank of the Ganges, and the Lord went that way in ecstasy.

  ; [[.3:20|Cc. Madhya 3.20]]
  : As the Lord proceeded along the bank of the Ganges, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu requested Ācāryaratna [Candraśekhara Ācārya] to go immediately to the house of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:21|Cc. Madhya 3.21]]
  : Śrī Nityānanda Gosvāmī told him, "I shall take Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the bank of the Ganges at Śāntipura, and Advaita Ācārya should carefully stay there on shore with a boat.

  ; [[.3:22|Cc. Madhya 3.22]]
  : "After that," Nityānanda Prabhu continued, "I shall go to Advaita Ācārya's house, and you should go to Navadvīpa and return with mother Śacī and all the other devotees."

  ; [[.3:23|Cc. Madhya 3.23]]
  : After sending Ācāryaratna to the house of Advaita Ācārya, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu went before Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and gave notice of His coming.

  ; [[.3:24|Cc. Madhya 3.24]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in ecstasy, and He asked where Nityānanda Prabhu was going. Nityānanda replied that He was going with Him toward Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.3:25|Cc. Madhya 3.25]]
  : When the Lord asked Nityānanda Prabhu how far it was to Vṛndāvana, Nityānanda replied, "Just see! Here is the river Yamunā."

  ; [[.3:26|Cc. Madhya 3.26]]
  : Saying this, Nityānanda Prabhu took Caitanya Mahāprabhu near the Ganges, and the Lord, in His ecstasy, accepted the river Ganges as the river Yamunā.

  ; [[.3:27|Cc. Madhya 3.27]]
  : The Lord said, "Oh, what good fortune! Now I have seen the river Yamunā." Thus thinking the Ganges to be the river Yamunā, Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to offer prayers to it.

  ; [[.3:28|Cc. Madhya 3.28]]
  : "O river Yamunā, you are the blissful spiritual water that gives love to the son of Nanda Mahārāja. You are the same as the water of the spiritual world, for you can vanquish all our offenses and the sinful reactions incurred in life. You are the creator of all auspicious things for the world. O daughter of the sun-god, kindly purify us by your pious activities."

  ; [[.3:29|Cc. Madhya 3.29]]
  : After reciting this mantra, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered obeisances and took His bath in the Ganges. At that time He had on only one piece of underwear, for there was no second garment.

  ; [[.3:30|Cc. Madhya 3.30]]
  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was standing there without a second garment, Śrī Advaita Ācārya arrived in a boat, bringing with Him new underwear and external garments.

  ; [[.3:31|Cc. Madhya 3.31]]
  : When Advaita Ācārya arrived, He stood before the Lord and offered His obeisances. After seeing Him, the Lord began to wonder about the entire situation.

  ; [[.3:32|Cc. Madhya 3.32]]
  : Still in His ecstasy, the Lord asked Advaita Ācārya, "Why did You come here? How did You know that I was in Vṛndāvana?"

  ; [[.3:33|Cc. Madhya 3.33]]
  : Advaita Ācārya disclosed the whole situation, telling Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Wherever You are, that is Vṛndāvana. Now it is My great fortune that You have come to the bank of the Ganges."

  ; [[.3:34|Cc. Madhya 3.34]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "Nityānanda has cheated Me. He has brought Me to the bank of the Ganges and told Me that it was the Yamunā."

  ; [[.3:35|Cc. Madhya 3.35]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accused Nityānanda of cheating Him, Śrīla Advaita Ācārya said, "Whatever Nityānanda Prabhu has told You is not false. You have indeed just now taken Your bath in the river Yamunā."

  ; [[.3:36|Cc. Madhya 3.36]]
  : Advaita Ācārya then explained that at that spot both the Ganges and Yamunā flow together. On the western side was the Yamunā, and on the eastern side was the Ganges.

  ; [[.3:37|Cc. Madhya 3.37]]
  : Advaita Ācārya then suggested that since Caitanya Mahāprabhu had taken His bath in the river Yamunā and His underwear was now wet, the Lord should change His underwear for dry garments.

  ; [[.3:38|Cc. Madhya 3.38]]
  : Advaita Ācārya said, "You have been fasting continuously for three days in Your ecstasy of love for Kṛṣṇa. I therefore invite You to My home, where You may kindly take Your alms. Come with Me to My residence."

  ; [[.3:39|Cc. Madhya 3.39]]
  : Advaita Prabhu continued, "At My home I have just cooked one palmful of rice. The vegetables are always very simple. There is no luxurious cooking-simply a little liquid vegetable and spinach."

  ; [[.3:40|Cc. Madhya 3.40]]
  : Saying this, Śrī Advaita Ācārya took the Lord into the boat and brought the Lord to His residence. There Advaita Ācārya washed the feet of the Lord and was consequently very happy within.

  ; [[.3:41|Cc. Madhya 3.41]]
  : All the eatables were first cooked by the wife of Advaita Ācārya. Then Śrīla Advaita Ācārya personally offered everything to Lord Viṣṇu.

  ; [[.3:42|Cc. Madhya 3.42]]
  : All the prepared food was divided into three equal parts. One part was arranged on a metal plate for offering to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.3:43|Cc. Madhya 3.43]]
  : Of the three divisions, one was arranged on a metal plate, and the other two were arranged on plantain leaves. These leaves were not bifurcated, and they were taken from a banana tree that held at least thirty-two bunches of bananas. The two plates were filled very nicely with the kinds of food described below.

  ; [[.3:44|Cc. Madhya 3.44]]
  : The cooked rice was a stack of very fine grains nicely cooked, and in the middle was yellow clarified butter from the milk of cows. Surrounding the stack of rice were pots made of the skins of banana trees, and in these pots were varieties of vegetables and mung dāl.

  ; [[.3:45|Cc. Madhya 3.45]]
  : Among the cooked vegetables were paṭolas, squash, mānakacu and a salad made with pieces of ginger and various types of spinach.

  ; [[.3:46|Cc. Madhya 3.46]]
  : There was sukhta, bitter melon mixed with all kinds of vegetables, defying the taste of nectar. There were five types of bitter and pungent sukhtas.

  ; [[.3:47|Cc. Madhya 3.47]]
  : Amongst the various vegetables were newly grown leaves of nimba trees fried with eggplant. The fruit known as paṭola was fried with phulabaḍi, a kind of dāl preparation first mashed and then dried in the sun. There was also a preparation known as kuṣmāṇḍa-mānacāki.

  ; [[.3:48|Cc. Madhya 3.48]]
  : The preparation made with coconut pulp mixed with curd and rock candy was very sweet. There was a curry made of banana flowers and squash boiled in milk, all in great quantity.

  ; [[.3:49|Cc. Madhya 3.49]]
  : There were small cakes in sweet and sour sauce and five or six kinds of sour preparations. All the vegetables were so made that everyone present could take prasāda.

  ; [[.3:50|Cc. Madhya 3.50]]
  : There were soft cakes made with mung dāl, soft cakes made with ripe bananas, and soft cakes made with urad dāl. There were various kinds of sweetmeats, condensed milk mixed with rice cakes, a coconut preparation and every kind of cake desirable.

  ; [[.3:51|Cc. Madhya 3.51]]
  : All the vegetables were served in pots made of banana leaves taken from trees producing at least thirty-two bunches of bananas. These pots were very strong and big and did not tilt or totter.

  ; [[.3:52|Cc. Madhya 3.52]]
  : All around the three eating places were a hundred pots filled with various kinds of vegetables.

  ; [[.3:53|Cc. Madhya 3.53]]
  : Along with the various vegetables was sweet rice mixed with ghee. This was kept in new earthen pots. Earthen pots filled with highly condensed milk were placed in three places.

  ; [[.3:54|Cc. Madhya 3.54]]
  : Besides the other preparations, there were chipped rice made with milk and mixed with bananas, and also white squash boiled in milk. Indeed, it is not possible to describe all the preparations that were made.

  ; [[.3:55|Cc. Madhya 3.55]]
  : In two places there were earthen pots filled with another preparation made with yogurt, sandeśa [a sweetmeat made with curd] and banana. I am unable to describe it all.

  ; [[.3:56|Cc. Madhya 3.56]]
  : Upon the stack of boiled rice and all the vegetables were flowers of the tulasī trees. There were also pots filled with scented rosewater.

  ; [[.3:57|Cc. Madhya 3.57]]
  : There were three sitting places where soft cloths were placed. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was offered all the food, and the Lord took it very pleasantly.

  ; [[.3:58|Cc. Madhya 3.58]]
  : It is the system, after offering food, to perform bhoga-ārati. Advaita Prabhu asked the two brothers, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, to come see the ārati. The two Lords and all others present went to see the ārati ceremony.

  ; [[.3:59|Cc. Madhya 3.59]]
  : After ārati was performed for the Deities in the temple, Lord Kṛṣṇa was made to lie down to rest. Advaita Ācārya then came out to submit something to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.3:60|Cc. Madhya 3.60]]
  : Śrī Advaita Prabhu said, "My dear Lords, kindly enter this room." The two brothers, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, then came forward to take the prasāda.

  ; [[.3:61|Cc. Madhya 3.61]]
  : When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu went to accept the prasāda, They both called Mukunda and Haridāsa to come with Them. However, Mukunda and Haridāsa, both with folded hands, spoke as follows.

  ; [[.3:62|Cc. Madhya 3.62]]
  : When Mukunda was called for, he submitted, "My dear sir, I have something to do that is not yet finished. Later I shall accept the prasāda, so You two Prabhus should now please enter the room."

  ; [[.3:63|Cc. Madhya 3.63]]
  : Haridāsa Ṭhākura said, "I am the most sinful and lowest among men. Later I shall eat one palmful of prasāda while waiting outside."

  ; [[.3:64|Cc. Madhya 3.64]]
  : Advaita Ācārya took Lord Nityānanda Prabhu and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu within the room, and the two Lords saw the arrangement of the prasāda. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was especially very much pleased.

  ; [[.3:65|Cc. Madhya 3.65]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved of all the methods employed in cooking and offering food to Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, He was so pleased that He said, "Frankly, I will personally take the lotus feet of anyone who can offer Kṛṣṇa such nice food and place those lotus feet on My head birth after birth."

  ; [[.3:66|Cc. Madhya 3.66]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the room, He saw three divisions of food, and He knew that all of these were meant for Kṛṣṇa. However, He did not understand the intentions of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:67|Cc. Madhya 3.67]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Let Us sit down in these three places, and We shall take prasāda." However, Advaita Ācārya said, "I shall distribute the prasāda."

  ; [[.3:68|Cc. Madhya 3.68]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thought that all three servings were meant for distribution; therefore He asked for another two banana leaves, saying, "Let Us have a very little quantity of vegetable and rice."

  ; [[.3:69|Cc. Madhya 3.69]]
  : Advaita Ācārya said, "Just sit down here on these seats." Catching Their hands, He sat Them both down.

  ; [[.3:70|Cc. Madhya 3.70]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "It is not proper for a sannyāsī to eat such a variety of foods. If he does, how can he control his senses?"

  ; [[.3:71|Cc. Madhya 3.71]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not accept the food that had already been served, Advaita Ācārya said, "Please give up Your concealment. I know what You are, and I know the confidential meaning of Your accepting the sannyāsa order."

  ; [[.3:72|Cc. Madhya 3.72]]
  : Advaita Ācārya thus requested Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to eat and give up juggling words. The Lord replied, "I certainly cannot eat so much food."

  ; [[.3:73|Cc. Madhya 3.73]]
  : Advaita Ācārya then requested the Lord to simply accept the prasāda without pretense. If He could not eat it all, the balance could be left on the plate.

  ; [[.3:74|Cc. Madhya 3.74]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I will not be able to eat so much food, and it is not the duty of a sannyāsī to leave remnants."

  ; [[.3:75|Cc. Madhya 3.75]]
  : In this connection Advaita Ācārya referred to Caitanya Mahāprabhu's eating at Jagannātha Purī. Lord Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are identical. Advaita Ācārya pointed out that at Jagannātha Purī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate fifty-four times a day, and each time He ate many hundreds of pots of food.

  ; [[.3:76|Cc. Madhya 3.76]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya said, "The amount of food that three people can eat does not constitute even a morsel for You. In proportion to that, these edibles are not even five morsels of food for You."

  ; [[.3:77|Cc. Madhya 3.77]]
  : Advaita Ācārya continued, "By My great fortune You have just come to My home. Please do not juggle words. Just begin eating and do not talk."

  ; [[.3:78|Cc. Madhya 3.78]]
  : Upon saying this, Advaita Ācārya supplied water to the two Lords so that They could wash Their hands. The two Lords then sat down and, smiling, began to eat the prasāda.

  ; [[.3:79|Cc. Madhya 3.79]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu said, "I have undergone fasting for three days continuously. Today I hoped to break My fast."

  ; [[.3:80|Cc. Madhya 3.80]]
  : Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was thinking that the quantity of food was enormous, Nityānanda Prabhu, on the contrary, thought it not even a morsel. He had been fasting for three days and had greatly hoped to break fast on that day. Indeed, He said, "Although I am invited to eat by Advaita Ācārya, today also is a fast. So small a quantity of food will not even fill half My belly."

  ; [[.3:81|Cc. Madhya 3.81]]
  : Advaita Ācārya replied, "Sir, You are a mendicant traveling on pilgrimage. Sometimes You eat fruits and roots, and sometimes You simply go on fasting.

  ; [[.3:82|Cc. Madhya 3.82]]
  : "I am a poor brāhmaṇa, and You have come to My home. Please be satisfied with whatever little food You have received and give up Your greedy mentality."

  ; [[.3:83|Cc. Madhya 3.83]]
  : Lord Nityānanda Prabhu replied, "Whatever I may be, You have invited Me. Therefore You must supply as much as I want to eat."

  ; [[.3:84|Cc. Madhya 3.84]]
  : His Divine Grace Advaita Ācārya, after hearing the statement of Nityānanda Prabhu, took the opportunity presented by the joking words and spoke to Him as follows.

  ; [[.3:85|Cc. Madhya 3.85]]
  : Advaita Ācārya said, "You are a reject paramahaṁsa, and You have accepted the renounced order of life just to fill up Your belly. I can understand that Your business is to give trouble to brāhmaṇas."

  ; [[.3:86|Cc. Madhya 3.86]]
  : Advaita Ācārya accused Nityānanda Prabhu, saying, "You can eat ten to twenty mānas of rice. I am a poor brāhmaṇa. How shall I get so much rice?

  ; [[.3:87|Cc. Madhya 3.87]]
  : "Whatever You have, though it be a palmful of rice, please eat it and get up. Don't show Your madness and strew the remnants of food here and there."

  ; [[.3:88|Cc. Madhya 3.88]]
  : In this way, Nityānanda Prabhu and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate and talked with Advaita Ācārya jokingly. After eating half of each vegetable preparation given to Him, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu abandoned it and went on to the next.

  ; [[.3:89|Cc. Madhya 3.89]]
  : As soon as half of the vegetable in the pot was finished, Advaita Ācārya filled it up again. In this way, as the Lord finished half of a preparation, Advaita Ācārya again and again filled it up.

  ; [[.3:90|Cc. Madhya 3.90]]
  : After filling a pot with vegetables, Advaita Ācārya requested Them to eat more, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "How much more can I go on eating?"

  ; [[.3:91|Cc. Madhya 3.91]]
  : Advaita Ācārya said, "Please do not give up whatever I have already given You. Now, whatever I am giving, You may eat half and leave half."

  ; [[.3:92|Cc. Madhya 3.92]]
  : In this way, by submitting various humble requests, Advaita Ācārya made Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Nityānanda eat. Thus Caitanya Mahāprabhu fulfilled all the desires of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:93|Cc. Madhya 3.93]]
  : Again Nityānanda Prabhu jokingly said, "My belly is not yet filled up. Please take away Your food. I have not taken the least of it."

  ; [[.3:94|Cc. Madhya 3.94]]
  : After saying this, Nityānanda Prabhu took a handful of rice and threw it on the floor in front of Him, as if He were angry.

  ; [[.3:95|Cc. Madhya 3.95]]
  : When two or four pieces of the thrown rice touched His body, Advaita Ācārya began to dance in various ways with the rice still stuck to His body.

  ; [[.3:96|Cc. Madhya 3.96]]
  : When the rice thrown by Nityānanda Prabhu touched His body, Advaita Ācārya thought Himself purified by the touch of remnants thrown by Paramahaṁsa Nityānanda. Therefore He began dancing.

  ; [[.3:97|Cc. Madhya 3.97]]
  : Advaita Ācārya jokingly said, "My dear Nityānanda, I invited You, and indeed I have received the results. You have no fixed caste or dynasty. By nature You are a madman.

  ; [[.3:98|Cc. Madhya 3.98]]
  : "To make Me a madman like Yourself, You have thrown the remnants of Your food at Me. You did not even fear the fact that I am a brāhmaṇa."

  ; [[.3:99|Cc. Madhya 3.99]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu replied, "These are the remnants of food left by Lord Kṛṣṇa. If You take them to be ordinary remnants, You have committed an offense."

  ; [[.3:100|Cc. Madhya 3.100]]
  : Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu continued, "If you invite at least one hundred sannyāsīs to Your home and feed them sumptuously, Your offense will be nullified."

  ; [[.3:101|Cc. Madhya 3.101]]
  : Advaita Ācārya replied, "I shall never again invite another sannyāsī, for it is a sannyāsī who has spoiled all My brahminical smṛti regulations."

  ; [[.3:102|Cc. Madhya 3.102]]
  : After this, Advaita Ācārya made the Lords wash Their hands and mouths. He then took Them to a nice bed and made Them lie down to take rest.

  ; [[.3:103|Cc. Madhya 3.103]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya fed the two Lords cloves and cardamom mixed with tulasī flowers. Thus there was a good flavor within Their mouths.

  ; [[.3:104|Cc. Madhya 3.104]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya then smeared the bodies of the Lords with sandalwood pulp and then placed very fragrant flower garlands on Their chests.

  ; [[.3:105|Cc. Madhya 3.105]]
  : When the Lord lay down on the bed, Advaita Ācārya waited to massage His legs, but the Lord was very hesitant and spoke as follows to Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:106|Cc. Madhya 3.106]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Advaita Ācārya, You have made Me dance in various ways. Now give up this practice. Go with Mukunda and Haridāsa and accept Your lunch."

  ; [[.3:107|Cc. Madhya 3.107]]
  : Thereupon Advaita Ācārya took prasāda with Mukunda and Haridāsa, and they all wholeheartedly ate as much as they desired.

  ; [[.3:108|Cc. Madhya 3.108]]
  : When the people of Śāntipura heard that Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was staying there, they all immediately came to see His lotus feet.

  ; [[.3:109|Cc. Madhya 3.109]]
  : Being very pleased, all the people loudly began to shout the holy name of the Lord, "Hari! Hari!" Indeed, they became struck with wonder upon seeing the beauty of the Lord.

  ; [[.3:110|Cc. Madhya 3.110]]
  : They saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's very fair-complexioned body and its bright luster, which conquered the brilliance of the sun. Over and above this was the beauty of the saffron garments that glittered upon His body.

  ; [[.3:111|Cc. Madhya 3.111]]
  : People came and went with great pleasure. There was no calculating how many people assembled there before the day was over.

  ; [[.3:112|Cc. Madhya 3.112]]
  : As soon as it was evening, Advaita Ācārya began the congregational chanting. He even began to dance Himself, and the Lord saw the performance.

  ; [[.3:113|Cc. Madhya 3.113]]
  : When Advaita Ācārya began to dance, Nityānanda Prabhu began dancing behind Him. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, being very pleased, also began dancing behind Him.

  ; [[.3:114|Cc. Madhya 3.114]]
  : Advaita Ācārya said, " 'My dear friends, what shall I say? Today I have received the highest transcendental pleasure. After many, many days, Lord Kṛṣṇa is in My house.' "

  ; [[.3:115|Cc. Madhya 3.115]]
  : Advaita Ācārya led the saṅkīrtana party, and with great pleasure He sang this verse. There was a manifestation of ecstatic perspiration, shivering, raised hairs, tears in the eyes and sometimes thundering and bellowing.

  ; [[.3:116|Cc. Madhya 3.116]]
  : While dancing, Advaita Ācārya would sometimes turn around and around and catch the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Advaita Ācārya would then speak to Him as follows.

  ; [[.3:117|Cc. Madhya 3.117]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya would say, "Many days You escaped Me by bluffing. Now I have You in My home, and I will keep You bound up."

  ; [[.3:118|Cc. Madhya 3.118]]
  : So speaking, Advaita Ācārya performed congregational chanting with great pleasure for three hours that night and danced all the time.

  ; [[.3:119|Cc. Madhya 3.119]]
  : When Advaita Ācārya danced in that way, Lord Caitanya felt ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, and because of His separation, the waves and flames of love increased.

  ; [[.3:120|Cc. Madhya 3.120]]
  : Being agitated by the ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu suddenly fell to the ground. Seeing this, Advaita Ācārya stopped dancing.

  ; [[.3:121|Cc. Madhya 3.121]]
  : When Mukunda saw the ecstasy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he understood the feelings of the Lord and began to sing many stanzas augmenting the force of the Lord's ecstasy.

  ; [[.3:122|Cc. Madhya 3.122]]
  : Advaita Ācārya raised the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to help Him dance, but the Lord, after hearing the stanzas sung by Mukunda, could not be held due to His bodily symptoms.

  ; [[.3:123|Cc. Madhya 3.123]]
  : Tears fell from His eyes, and His whole body trembled. His hair stood on end, He perspired heavily, and His words faltered. Sometimes He stood, and sometimes He fell. And sometimes He cried.

  ; [[.3:124|Cc. Madhya 3.124]]
  : Mukunda sang, " 'My dear intimate friend! What has not happened to me! Due to the effects of the poison of love for Kṛṣṇa, my body and mind have been severely afflicted.

  ; [[.3:125|Cc. Madhya 3.125]]
  : " 'My feeling is like this: My mind burns day and night, and I can get no rest. If there were someplace I could go to meet Kṛṣṇa, I would immediately fly there.' "

  ; [[.3:126|Cc. Madhya 3.126]]
  : This stanza was sung by Mukunda in a very sweet voice, but as soon as Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard this stanza, His mind went to pieces.

  ; [[.3:127|Cc. Madhya 3.127]]
  : The transcendental ecstatic symptoms of disappointment, moroseness, pleasure, restlessness, pride and humility all began to fight like soldiers within the Lord.

  ; [[.3:128|Cc. Madhya 3.128]]
  : The entire body of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to totter due to the onslaught of various ecstatic symptoms. As a result, He immediately fell on the ground, and His breathing almost stopped.

  ; [[.3:129|Cc. Madhya 3.129]]
  : Upon seeing the condition of the Lord, all the devotees became very anxious. Then, suddenly, the Lord got up and began to make thundering sounds.

  ; [[.3:130|Cc. Madhya 3.130]]
  : Upon standing up, the Lord said, "Go on speaking! Go on speaking!" Thus He began to dance, overwhelmed with pleasure. No one could understand the strong waves of this ecstasy.

  ; [[.3:131|Cc. Madhya 3.131]]
  : Lord Nityānanda began to walk with Caitanya Mahāprabhu to see that He would not fall, and Advaita Ācārya and Haridāsa Ṭhākura followed Them, dancing.

  ; [[.3:132|Cc. Madhya 3.132]]
  : In this way the Lord danced for at least three hours. Sometimes the symptoms of ecstasy were visible, including pleasure, moroseness and many other waves of ecstatic emotional love.

  ; [[.3:133|Cc. Madhya 3.133]]
  : The Lord had been fasting for three days, and after that period He took eatables sumptuously. Thus when He danced and jumped high, He became a little fatigued.

  ; [[.3:134|Cc. Madhya 3.134]]
  : Being fully absorbed in love of Godhead, He would not understand His fatigue. But Nityānanda Prabhu, catching Him, stopped His dancing.

  ; [[.3:135|Cc. Madhya 3.135]]
  : Although the Lord was fatigued, Nityānanda Prabhu kept Him steady by holding Him. At that time Advaita Ācārya suspended the chanting and, by rendering various services to the Lord, made Him lie down to take rest.

  ; [[.3:136|Cc. Madhya 3.136]]
  : For ten continuous days Advaita Ācārya held feasting and chanting in the evening. He served the Lord in this way without any change.

  ; [[.3:137|Cc. Madhya 3.137]]
  : In the morning Candraśekhara brought Śacīmātā from her house with many devotees, and he seated her in a palanquin.

  ; [[.3:138|Cc. Madhya 3.138]]
  : In this way, all the people of the town of Nadia-including all women, boys and old men-came there. Thus the crowd increased.

  ; [[.3:139|Cc. Madhya 3.139]]
  : In the morning, after regular duties were completed and the Lord was chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, the people accompanied Śacīmātā to the house of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:140|Cc. Madhya 3.140]]
  : As soon as mother Śacī appeared on the scene, Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell before her like a stick. Mother Śacī began to cry, taking the Lord on her lap.

  ; [[.3:141|Cc. Madhya 3.141]]
  : Upon seeing each other, they both became overwhelmed. Seeing the Lord's head without hair, mother Śacī became greatly agitated.

  ; [[.3:142|Cc. Madhya 3.142]]
  : Out of love she began to caress the body of the Lord. Sometimes she kissed His face and tried to observe Him carefully, but because her eyes were filled with tears, she could not see.

  ; [[.3:143|Cc. Madhya 3.143]]
  : Understanding that Lord Caitanya had accepted the renounced order of life, Śacīmātā, crying, said to the Lord, "My darling Nimāi, do not be cruel like Viśvarūpa, Your elder brother."

  ; [[.3:144|Cc. Madhya 3.144]]
  : Mother Śacī continued, "After accepting the renounced order, Viśvarūpa never again gave me audience. If You do like Him, that will certainly be the death of me."

  ; [[.3:145|Cc. Madhya 3.145]]
  : The Lord replied, "My dear mother, please hear. This body belongs to you. I do not possess anything.

  ; [[.3:146|Cc. Madhya 3.146]]
  : "This body was raised by you, and it comes from you. I cannot repay this debt even in millions of births.

  ; [[.3:147|Cc. Madhya 3.147]]
  : "Knowingly or unknowingly I have accepted this renounced order. Still, I shall never be indifferent to you.

  ; [[.3:148|Cc. Madhya 3.148]]
  : "My dear mother, wherever you ask Me to stay I shall stay, and whatever you order I shall execute."

  ; [[.3:149|Cc. Madhya 3.149]]
  : Saying this, the Lord offered obeisances to His mother again and again, and mother Śacī, being pleased, took Him again and again on her lap.

  ; [[.3:150|Cc. Madhya 3.150]]
  : Then Advaita Ācārya took mother Śacī within the house. The Lord was immediately ready to meet all the devotees.

  ; [[.3:151|Cc. Madhya 3.151]]
  : The Lord met all the devotees one after the other, and looking at everyone's face individually, He embraced them tightly.

  ; [[.3:152|Cc. Madhya 3.152]]
  : Although the devotees were unhappy at not seeing the Lord's hair, they nonetheless derived great happiness from seeing His beauty.

  ; [[.3:153-155|Cc. Madhya 3.153-155]]
  : Śrīvāsa, Rāmāi, Vidyānidhi, Gadādhara, Gaṅgādāsa, Vakreśvara, Murāri, Śuklāmbara, Buddhimanta Khāṅ, Nandana, Śrīdhara, Vijaya, Vāsudeva, Dāmodara, Mukunda, Sañjaya and all the others, however many I can mention-indeed, all the inhabitants of Navadvīpa-arrived there, and the Lord met them with smiles and glances of mercy.

  ; [[.3:156|Cc. Madhya 3.156]]
  : Everyone was chanting the holy names of Hari and dancing. In this way the domicile of Advaita Ācārya was converted into Śrī Vaikuṇṭha Purī.

  ; [[.3:157|Cc. Madhya 3.157]]
  : People came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu from various other villages nearby, as well as Navadvīpa.

  ; [[.3:158|Cc. Madhya 3.158]]
  : To everyone who came to see the Lord from villages nearby, especially from Navadvīpa, Advaita Ācārya gave residential quarters, as well as all kinds of eatables, for many days. Indeed, He properly adjusted everything.

  ; [[.3:159|Cc. Madhya 3.159]]
  : The supplies of Advaita Ācārya were inexhaustible and indestructible. As many goods and commodities as He used, just as many again appeared.

  ; [[.3:160|Cc. Madhya 3.160]]
  : From the day Śacīmātā arrived at the house of Advaita Ācārya, she took charge of the cooking, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu dined in the company of all the devotees.

  ; [[.3:161|Cc. Madhya 3.161]]
  : All the people who came there during the day saw Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the friendly behavior of Advaita Ācārya. At night they had the opportunity to see the Lord's dancing and hear His chanting.

  ; [[.3:162|Cc. Madhya 3.162]]
  : When the Lord performed kīrtana, He manifested all kinds of transcendental symptoms. He appeared stunned and trembling, His hair stood on end, and His voice faltered. There were tears and devastation.

  ; [[.3:163|Cc. Madhya 3.163]]
  : Frequently the Lord would tumble to the ground. Seeing this, mother Śacī would cry.

  ; [[.3:164|Cc. Madhya 3.164]]
  : Śrīmatī Śacīmātā thought that the body of Nimāi was being smashed when He fell down so. She cried, "Alas!" and petitioned Lord Viṣṇu.

  ; [[.3:165|Cc. Madhya 3.165]]
  : "My dear Lord, kindly bestow this benediction as a result of whatever service I have rendered unto You from my childhood.

  ; [[.3:166|Cc. Madhya 3.166]]
  : "Whenever Nimāi falls to the surface of the earth, please do not let Him feel any pain."

  ; [[.3:167|Cc. Madhya 3.167]]
  : When mother Śacī was thus overwhelmed in parental love for Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, she became transformed with happiness, fear and humility, as well as bodily symptoms.

  ; [[.3:168|Cc. Madhya 3.168]]
  : Since Advaita Ācārya was giving alms and food to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the other devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, also desired to give Him alms and invite Him for lunch.

  ; [[.3:169|Cc. Madhya 3.169]]
  : Hearing these proposals made by other devotees of the Lord, mother Śacī said to the devotees, "How many times shall I get the chance to see Nimāi again?"

  ; [[.3:170|Cc. Madhya 3.170]]
  : Śacīmātā submitted, "As far as you are concerned, you can meet Nimāi, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, many times somewhere else, but what is the possibility of my ever meeting Him again? I shall have to remain at home. A sannyāsī never returns to his home."

  ; [[.3:171|Cc. Madhya 3.171]]
  : Mother Śacī appealed to all the devotees to give her this charity: As long as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained at the house of Advaita Ācārya, only she would supply Him food.

  ; [[.3:172|Cc. Madhya 3.172]]
  : Hearing this appeal from mother Śacī, all the devotees offered obeisances and said, "We all agree to whatever mother Śacī desires."

  ; [[.3:173|Cc. Madhya 3.173]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw His mother's great eagerness, He became a little agitated. He therefore assembled all the devotees present and spoke to them.

  ; [[.3:174|Cc. Madhya 3.174]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed them all, "Without your order, I tried to go to Vṛndāvana. There was some obstacle, however, and I had to return.

  ; [[.3:175|Cc. Madhya 3.175]]
  : "My dear friends, although I have suddenly accepted this renounced order, I still know that I shall never be indifferent to you.

  ; [[.3:176|Cc. Madhya 3.176]]
  : "My dear friends, as long as I remain manifest, I shall never give you up. Nor shall I be able to give up My mother.

  ; [[.3:177|Cc. Madhya 3.177]]
  : "After accepting sannyāsa, it is not the duty of a sannyāsī to remain at his birthplace, encircled by relatives.

  ; [[.3:178|Cc. Madhya 3.178]]
  : "Make some arrangement so that I may not leave you and at the same time people may not blame Me for remaining with relatives after taking sannyāsa."

  ; [[.3:179|Cc. Madhya 3.179]]
  : After hearing Lord Caitanya's statement, all the devotees, headed by Advaita Ācārya, approached mother Śacī.

  ; [[.3:180|Cc. Madhya 3.180]]
  : When they submitted Lord Caitanya's statement, mother Śacī, who is the mother of the universe, began to speak.

  ; [[.3:181|Cc. Madhya 3.181]]
  : Śacīmātā said, "It will be a great happiness for me if Nimāi, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, stays here. But at the same time, if someone blames Him, it will be my great unhappiness."

  ; [[.3:182|Cc. Madhya 3.182]]
  : Mother Śacī said, "This consideration is good. In my opinion, if Nimāi remains at Jagannātha Purī, He may not leave any one of us and at the same time can remain aloof as a sannyāsī. Thus both purposes are fulfilled.

  ; [[.3:183|Cc. Madhya 3.183]]
  : "Since Jagannātha Purī and Navadvīpa are intimately related-as if they were two rooms in the same house-people from Navadvīpa generally go to Jagannātha Purī, and those in Jagannātha Purī go to Navadvīpa. This going and coming will help carry news of Lord Caitanya. In this way I will be able to get news of Him.

  ; [[.3:184|Cc. Madhya 3.184]]
  : "All you devotees will be able to come and go, and sometimes He may also come to take His bath in the Ganges.

  ; [[.3:185|Cc. Madhya 3.185]]
  : "I do not care for my personal happiness or unhappiness, but only for His happiness. Indeed, I accept His happiness as my happiness."

  ; [[.3:186|Cc. Madhya 3.186]]
  : After hearing Śacīmātā, all the devotees offered her prayers and assured her that her order, like a Vedic injunction, could not be violated.

  ; [[.3:187|Cc. Madhya 3.187]]
  : All the devotees informed Lord Caitanya of Śacīmātā's decision. Hearing it, the Lord became very pleased.

  ; [[.3:188|Cc. Madhya 3.188]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered respects to all the devotees present from Navadvīpa and other towns, speaking to them as follows.

  ; [[.3:189|Cc. Madhya 3.189]]
  : "My dear friends, you are all My intimate friends. Now I am begging a favor of you. Please give it to Me."

  ; [[.3:190|Cc. Madhya 3.190]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested them all to return home and begin chanting the holy name congregationally. He also requested them to worship Kṛṣṇa, chant His holy name and discuss His holy pastimes.

  ; [[.3:191|Cc. Madhya 3.191]]
  : After thus instructing the devotees, the Lord asked their permission to go to Jagannātha Purī. He assured them that at intervals He would come there and meet them again and again.

  ; [[.3:192|Cc. Madhya 3.192]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, offering due respects to all the devotees and smiling very mildly, bid them farewell.

  ; [[.3:193|Cc. Madhya 3.193]]
  : After requesting all the devotees to return home, the Lord decided to go to Jagannātha Purī. At that time Haridāsa Ṭhākura began to cry and speak some pathetic words.

  ; [[.3:194|Cc. Madhya 3.194]]
  : Haridāsa Ṭhākura said, "You are going to Jagannātha Purī, and that is all right, but what will be my destination? I am not able to go to Jagannātha Purī."

  ; [[.3:195|Cc. Madhya 3.195]]
  : "Because I am the lowest among men, I shall not be able to see You. How shall I maintain my sinful life?"

  ; [[.3:196|Cc. Madhya 3.196]]
  : The Lord replied to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, "Please check your humility. Just seeing your humility very much agitates My mind."

  ; [[.3:197|Cc. Madhya 3.197]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu assured Haridāsa Ṭhākura that He would place a petition before Lord Jagannātha and that He would certainly take him there to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.3:198|Cc. Madhya 3.198]]
  : After that, Advaita Ācārya respectfully requested Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu to show Him mercy by remaining another two or four days.

  ; [[.3:199|Cc. Madhya 3.199]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu never violated the request of Advaita Ācārya; therefore He remained at His home and did not leave immediately for Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.3:200|Cc. Madhya 3.200]]
  : Lord Caitanya's decision was received very happily by Advaita Ācārya, mother Śacī and all the devotees. Advaita Ācārya celebrated every day with a great festival.

  ; [[.3:201|Cc. Madhya 3.201]]
  : During the day the devotees discussed subject matters concerning Kṛṣṇa, and at night there was a great festival of congregational chanting at the house of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.3:202|Cc. Madhya 3.202]]
  : Mother Śacī cooked with great pleasure, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, along with the devotees, accepted the prasāda with great pleasure.

  ; [[.3:203|Cc. Madhya 3.203]]
  : In this way all the opulences of Advaita Ācārya-His faith, devotion, home, riches and everything else-were successfully utilized in the worship of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.3:204|Cc. Madhya 3.204]]
  : As mother Śacī constantly saw the face of her son and fed Him, her own happiness increased and was indeed complete.

  ; [[.3:205|Cc. Madhya 3.205]]
  : In this way, at Advaita Ācārya's house all the devotees met and passed some days together in a greatly festive mood.

  ; [[.3:206|Cc. Madhya 3.206]]
  : The next day, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested all the devotees to return to their respective homes.

  ; [[.3:207|Cc. Madhya 3.207]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also asked them to execute the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord at their homes, and He assured them that they would be able to meet Him again.

  ; [[.3:208|Cc. Madhya 3.208]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told them, "Sometimes you will come to Jagannātha Purī, and sometimes I shall come bathe in the Ganges."

  ; [[.3:209-210|Cc. Madhya 3.209-210]]
  : Śrī Advaita Ācārya sent four persons-Nityānanda Gosāñi, Jagadānanda Paṇḍita, Dāmodara Paṇḍita and Mukunda Datta-to accompany the Lord. After pacifying His mother, Śacīmātā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu submitted prayers to her lotus feet.

  ; [[.3:211|Cc. Madhya 3.211]]
  : When everything was arranged, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu circumambulated His mother and then started for Jagannātha Purī. In the house of Advaita Ācārya there arose tumultuous crying.

  ; [[.3:212|Cc. Madhya 3.212]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was unaffected. He left swiftly, and Advaita Ācārya followed Him weeping.

  ; [[.3:213|Cc. Madhya 3.213]]
  : After He had followed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for some distance, Advaita Ācārya was petitioned by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with folded hands. The Lord spoke the following sweet words.

  ; [[.3:214|Cc. Madhya 3.214]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Please pacify all the devotees and My mother. If You become agitated, no one will be able to continue to exist."

  ; [[.3:215|Cc. Madhya 3.215]]
  : Saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Advaita Ācārya and stopped Him from following any further. Then, without anxiety, He proceeded to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.3:216|Cc. Madhya 3.216]]
  : The Lord, with the other four persons, went along the banks of the Ganges through the path of Chatrabhoga toward Nīlādri, Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.3:217|Cc. Madhya 3.217]]
  : In his book known as Caitanya-maṅgala [Caitanya-bhāgavata], Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has elaborately described the Lord's passage to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.3:218|Cc. Madhya 3.218]]
  : If one hears the activities of the Lord at the house of Advaita Ācārya, he will certainly very soon attain the riches of love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.3:219|Cc. Madhya 3.219]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
