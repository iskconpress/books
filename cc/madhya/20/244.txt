The //puruṣa-avatāras// are the Lords of the universal creation. These are the Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. There are also //līlā-avatāras,// and these include (1) Catuḥsana, (2) Nārada, (3) Varāha, (4) Matsya, (5) Yajña, (6) Nara-Nārāyaṇa, (7) Kārdami Kapila, (8) Dattātreya, (9) Hayaśīrṣā, (10) Haṁsa, (11) Dhruvapriya, or Pṛśnigarbha, (12) Ṛṣabha, (13) Pṛthu, (14) Nṛsiṁha, (15) Kūrma, (16) Dhanvantari, (17) Mohinī, (18) Vāmana, (19) Bhārgava Paraśurāma, (20) Rāghavendra, (21) Vyāsa, (22) Pralambāri Balarāma, (23) Kṛṣṇa, (24) Buddha and (25) Kalki.

These twenty-five Personalities of Godhead are known as //līlā-avatāras.// Because they appear in each day of Brahmā, or in each //kalpa// (millennium), they are sometimes known as //kalpa-avatāras.// Of these incarnations, Haṁsa and Mohinī are not very permanent or well known, but They are listed among the //prābhava-avatāras.// Kapila, Dattātreya, Ṛṣabha, Dhanvantari and Vyāsa are eternally situated and very widely known. They are also counted among the //prābhava// incarnations. Kūrma, Matsya, Nārāyaṇa, Varāha, Hayagrīva, Pṛśnigarbha, and Baladeva, the killer of Pralambāsura, are counted among the //vaibhava-avatāras.//
