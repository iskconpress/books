The word //mādhukarī// comes from the word //madhukara,// which refers to bees collecting honey from flower to flower. A //mādhukarī// is a saintly person or a mendicant who does not accept a full meal at one house but begs from door to door, taking a little food from each householder's place. In this way he does not overeat or give householders unnecessary trouble. A person in the renounced order may beg but not cook. His begging should not be a burden for the householders. The //mādhukarī// process is strictly to be followed by a //bābājī,// that is, one who has attained the //paramahaṁsa// stage. This practice is still current in Vṛndāvana, and there are many places where alms are offered. Unfortunately, there are many beggars who have come to Vṛndāvana to accept alms but not follow the principles of Sanātana Gosvāmī. People try to imitate him and lead an idle life by practicing //mādhukarī.// It is almost impossible to strictly follow Sanātana Gosvāmī or Rūpa Gosvāmī. It is better to accept food offered to Kṛṣṇa in the temple than to try to imitate Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī.

"He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the //yoga// system." [[books:bg:6:17|(Bg. 6.17)]]

The ideal //sannyāsī// strictly follows the ways practiced by the Gosvāmīs.
