===== Purport =====

In the //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta, Pūrva-khaṇḍa,// verse 17, it is stated:

> tādṛśo nyūna-śaktiṁ yo
> vyanakti svāṁśa īritaḥ
> saṅkarṣaṇādir matsyādir
> yathā tat-tat-svadhāmasu

When a form of Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from the original form but is less important and exhibits less potency, it is called //svāṁśa.// Examples of the //svāṁśa// expansion can be found in the quadruple forms of the Lord residing in their respective places, beginning with Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha and including the //puruṣa-avatāras, līlā-avatāras, manvantara-avatāras// and //yuga-avatāras.//
