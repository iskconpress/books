To understand the difference between //svayaṁ-rūpa, tad-ekātma-rūpa, āveśa, prābhava// and //vaibhava,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has given the following description. In the beginning, Kṛṣṇa has three bodily features: (1) //svayaṁ-rūpa,// as a cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana; (2) //tad-ekātma-rūpa,// which is divided into //svāṁśaka// and //vilāsa;// and (3) //āveśa-rūpa.// The //svāṁśaka,// or expansions of the personal potency, are (1) Kāraṇodakaśāyī, Garbhodakaśāyī, Kṣīrodakaśāyī and (2) incarnations such as the fish, tortoise, boar and Nṛsiṁha. The //vilāsa-rūpa// has a //prābhava// division, including Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. There is also a //vaibhava// division in which there are twenty-four forms, including the second Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. For each of these, there are three forms; therefore there are twelve forms altogether. These twelve forms constitute the predominant names for the twelve months of the year as well as the twelve //tilaka// marks on the body. Each of the four Personalities of Godhead expands into two other forms; thus there are eight forms, such as Puruṣottama, Acyuta, etc. The four forms (Vāsudeva, etc.), the twelve (Keśava, etc.), and the eight (Puruṣottama, etc.) all together constitute twenty-four forms. All the forms are differently named in accordance with the weapons They hold in Their four hands.
