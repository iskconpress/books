===== Purport =====

The influence of the material energy cannot touch Lord Viṣṇu as she touches Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Therefore it is said that Lord Viṣṇu is transcendental to the material qualities. The incarnations of the material qualities-Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā-are under the jurisdiction of the external energy. Lord Viṣṇu, however, is different. In the //mantras// of the //Ṛg Veda// it is said: //oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam (Ṛg Veda-saṁhitā// 1.22.20). The words //paramaṁ padam// indicate that He is transcendental to the material qualities. Because Lord Viṣṇu is not within the jurisdiction of the material qualities, He is always superior to the living entities who are controlled by material energy. This is one of the differences between the Supreme Lord and the living entities. Lord Brahmā is a very powerful living entity, and Lord Śiva is even more powerful. Therefore Lord Śiva is not accepted as a living entity, but at the same time is not considered to be on the level of Lord Viṣṇu.
