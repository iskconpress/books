This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:26:19|(3.26.19)]]. Lord Kapila is explaining to His mother the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and material nature. He is informing her how the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of the living entities, who emanated from material nature. Over and above the twenty-eight elements of the material creation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Life comes not from matter but from life itself. As explained in the //Vedas:nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām (Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13). The Supreme Lord is the original source of life.
