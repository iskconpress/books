===== Purport =====

At the top of the //paravyoma,// the spiritual sky, there is Goloka Vṛndāvana, which is divided into three parts. Two of the parts, called Mathurā and Dvārakā, are the residences of Kṛṣṇa in His //prābhava-vilāsa// forms. Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa's //vaibhava-prakāśa,// is eternally situated in Gokula. From the quadruple //prābhava-vilāsa,// twenty-four forms of the //vaibhava-vilāsa// are expanded. Each has four hands holding weapons in different positions. The topmost planet in the spiritual sky is Goloka Vṛndāvana, and below that planet is the spiritual sky itself. In that spiritual sky, Kṛṣṇa Himself is four-handed and is situated as Nārāyaṇa.
