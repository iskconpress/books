This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:6:32|(2.6.32)]]. Lord Brahmā gave this information to Devarṣi Nārada when he was receiving instructions from Lord Brahmā to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā. After describing the universal form of the Lord, Lord Brahmā explained that his position and Lord Śiva's position are controlled by Lord Viṣṇu.
