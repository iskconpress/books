===== Purport =====

The words //bhadra karāñā// are significant in this verse. Due to his long hair, moustache and beard, Sanātana Gosvāmī looked like a //daraveśa,// or hippie. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like Sanātana Gosvāmī's hippie features, he immediately asked Candraśekhara to get him shaved clean. If anyone with long hair or a beard wants to join this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and live with us, he must similarly shave himself clean. The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu consider long hair objectionable. Sanātana Gosvāmī was saved from a hellish condition (Mahāraurava) by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Mahāraurava is a hell wherein animal killers are placed. In this regard, refer to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (5.26.10-12).
