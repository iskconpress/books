===== Purport =====

Rudra is simultaneously one with and different from the //viṣṇu-tattva.// Due to his association with //māyā,// he is different from the //viṣṇu-tattva,// but at the same time he is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa's personal form. This situation is called //bhedābheda-tattva,// or //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,// simultaneously one and different.
