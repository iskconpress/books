{{description>"These universes are understood to be floating in air as the Mahā-Viṣṇu exhales. They are like atomic particles that float in sunshine and pass through the holes of a screen. All these universes are thus created by the exhalation of Mahā-Viṣṇu, and when Mahā-Viṣṇu inhales, they return to His body. The unlimited opulences of Mahā-Viṣṇu are completely beyond material conception.}}
