This is a prayer from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.29) spoken by Karabhājana Muni when he was questioned by Mahārāja Nimi, the King of Videha, about the incarnations in specific //yugas// and their method of worship. Karabhājana Muni was one of the nine Yogendras, and he met the King to inform him about future incarnations.
