As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:55|(Bg. 18.55)]].

> bhaktyā mām abhijānāti
> yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ
> tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā
> viśate tad-anantaram

"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter the kingdom of God."

The aim of life is to get rid of the material conditioning and enter into spiritual existence. Although the //śāstras// prescribe different methods for different men, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one ultimately must accept the path of devotional service as the assured path of spiritual advancement. Devotional service to the Lord is the only process actually confirmed by the Lord. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]. One must become a devotee if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, and become eternally blissful.
