Foolish people try to concoct knowledge by manufacturing something in their brains. That is not the real way of knowledge. Knowledge is //śabda-pramāṇa,// evidence from Vedic literature. Śrīla Vyāsadeva is called Mahāmuni. He is also known as Vedavyāsa because he has compiled so many //śāstras.// He has divided the //Vedas// into four divisions-//Sāma, Ṛg, Yajur// and //Atharva.// He has expanded the //Vedas// into eighteen //Purāṇas// and has summarized Vedic knowledge in the //Vedānta-sūtra.// He also compiled the //Mahābhārata,// which is accepted as the fifth //Veda. Bhagavad-gītā// is contained within the //Mahābhārata.// Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// is also Vedic literature (//smṛti).// Some of the Vedic literatures are called //śrutis,// and some are called //smṛtis.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī recommends in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.2.101):

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva kalpate

Unless one refers to //śāstra (śruti, smṛti// and //purāṇādi),// one's spiritual activity simply disturbs society. There is no king or government to check people, and therefore society has fallen into a chaotic condition as far as spiritual understanding is concerned. Taking advantage of this chaotic condition, many rascals have appeared and proclaimed themselves incarnations of God. As a result, the entire population is indulging in sinful activities such as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Out of many sinful people, many incarnations of God are emerging. This is a very regrettable situation, especially in India.
