In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:10|(Bg. 7.10)]], Kṛṣṇa says, //bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām:// "I am the original seed of all existences." This is also confirmed in another verse in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:4|(Bg. 14.4)]]:

> sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
> mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ
> tāsāṁ brahma mahad-yonir
> ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā

"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father."

For a further explanation, one may refer to //Brahma-saṁhitā// (Chapter Five, verses 10-13). //Brahma-saṁhitā// also states (5.51):

> agnir mahī gaganam ambu marud diśaś ca
> kālas tathātma-manasīti jagat-trayāṇi
> yasmād bhavanti vibhavanti viśanti yaṁ ca
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

All material elements, as well as the spiritual sparks (individual souls), are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed by the //Vedānta-sūtra// (1.1). //janmādy asya yataḥ:// "The Absolute Truth is He from whom everything emanates." He is the Supreme Truth: //satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi// [[books:sb:1:1:1|(Bhāg. 1.1.1)]]. The absolute ultimate truth is Kṛṣṇa. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ:// "The Absolute Truth is a person who is directly and indirectly cognizant of the entire cosmic manifestation." [[books:sb:1:1:1|(Bhāg. 1.1.1)]]

The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, educated Lord Brahmā from the heart [[books:sb:1:1:1|(Bhāg. 1.1.1)]]: //tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye.// Therefore the Absolute Truth cannot be dull matter; the Absolute Truth must be the Supreme Person Himself. //Sei puruṣa māyā-pāne kare avadhāna.// Simply by His glance, material nature is impregnated with all living entities. According to their //karma// and fruitive activity, they emerge in different bodies. That is the explanation given by //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]:

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptir
> dhīras tatra na muhyati

"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
