===== Purport =====

When Lord Kṛṣṇa took His birth, He appeared outside the womb as four-handed Viṣṇu. Then Devakī and Vasudeva offered their prayers to Him and asked Him to assume His two-handed form. The Lord immediately assumed His two handed form and ordered that He be transferred to Gokula on the other side of the River Yamunā.
