{{description>" 'What is the direction of all Vedic literatures? On whom do they set focus? Who is the purpose of all speculation? Outside of Me no one knows these things. Now you should know that all these activities are aimed at ordaining and setting forth Me. The purpose of Vedic literature is to know Me by different speculations, either by indirect understanding or by dictionary understanding. Everyone is speculating about Me. The essence of all Vedic literatures is to distinguish Me from māyā. By considering the illusory energy, one comes to the platform of understanding Me. In this way one becomes free from speculation about the Vedas and comes to Me as the conclusion. Thus one is satisfied.'}}

These two verses are quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.21.42,43). When Uddhava asked Kṛṣṇa about the purpose of Vedic speculation, the Lord informed him of the process of understanding Vedic literature. The //Vedas// are composed of //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa// and //upāsanā-kāṇḍa.// If one analytically studies the purpose of the //Vedas,// he understands that by //karma-kāṇḍa,// sacrificial activity, one comes to the conclusion of //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// speculative knowledge. After speculation, one comes to the conclusion that worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate. When one comes to this conclusion, he becomes fully satisfied.
