===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all //viṣṇu-tattvas,// including Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. He is the ultimate goal of Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Everything emanates from Him. His body is completely spiritual and is the source of all spiritual being. Although He is the source of everything, He Himself has no source. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpaṁ, ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// Although He is the supreme source of everyone, He is still always a fresh youth.
