===== Purport =====

The three types of egotism (//ahaṅkāra//) are technically known as //vaikārika, taijasa// and //tāmasa.// The //mahat-tattva// is situated within the heart, or //citta,// and the predominating Deity of the //mahat-tattva// is Lord Vāsudeva [[books:sb:3:26:21|(Bhāg. 3.26.21)]]. The //mahat-tattva// is transformed into three divisions: (1) //vaikārika,// egotism in goodness (//sāttvika-ahaṅkāra//), from which the eleventh sense organ, the mind, is manifest and whose predominating Deity is Aniruddha [[books:sb:3:26:27|(Bhāg. 3.26.27-28)]]; (2) //taijasa,// or egotism in passion (//rājasa-ahaṅkāra//), from which the senses and intelligence are manifest and whose predominating Deity is Lord Pradyumna [[books:sb:3.26.29|(Bhāg. 3.26.29-31)]]; (3) //tāmasa,// or egotism in ignorance, from which sound vibration (//śabda-tanmātra//) expands. From the sound vibration, the sky (//ākāśa//) is manifest and, the senses, beginning with the ear, are also manifest [[books:sb:3:26:32|(Bhāg. 3.26.32)]]. Of these three types of egotism, Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa is the predominating Deity. In the philosophical discourse known as the //Sāṅkhya-kārikā,// it is stated: //sāttvika ekādaśakaḥ pravartate vaikṛtād ahaṅkārāt-bhūtādes tan-mātraṁ tāmasa-taijasādy-ubhayam.//
