**"At Viṣṇu-kāñcī there is Lord Viṣṇu, at Māyāpur Lord Hari, and throughout the universe a variety of other forms.**

===== Purport =====

All of these forms are //mūrti// forms, and They are worshiped in the temples. Their names are Keśava at Mathurā, Puruṣottama or Jagannātha at Nīlācala, Śrī Bindu Mādhava at Prayāga, Madhusūdana at Mandāra, and Vāsudeva, Padmanābha and Janārdana at Ānandāraṇya, which is situated in Kerala, South India. At Viṣṇu-kāñcī, which is situated in the Barada state, there is Lord Viṣṇu, and Hari is situated at Māyāpur, Lord Caitanya's birthsite. Thus in different places throughout the universe there are various Deities in temples bestowing Their causeless mercy upon the devotees. All these Deity forms are nondifferent from the //mūrtis// in the spiritual world of the Vaikuṇṭhas. Although the //arcā-mūrti,// the worshipable Deity form of the Lord, appears to be made of material elements, it is as good as the spiritual forms found in the spiritual Vaikuṇṭhalokas. The Deity in the temple, however, is visible to the material eyes of the devotee. It is not possible for one in material conditional life to see the spiritual form of the Lord. To bestow causeless mercy upon us, the Lord appears as //arcā-mūrti// so that we can see Him. It is forbidden to consider the //arcā-mūrti// to be made of stone or wood. In the //Padma Purāṇa// it is said:

> arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhir
> viṣṇor vā vaiṣṇavānāṁ kali-mala-mathane pāda-tīrthe 'mbu-buddhiḥ
> śrī-viṣṇor nāmni mantre sakala-kaluṣa-he śabde-sāmānya-buddhir
> viṣṇau sarveśvareśe tad-itara-sama-dhīr yasya vā nārakī saḥ

No one should consider the Deity in the temple to be made of stone or wood, nor should one consider the spiritual master an ordinary human being. No one should consider a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a particular caste or creed, and no one should consider //caraṇāmṛta// or Ganges water to be like ordinary water. Nor should anyone consider the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// to be a material vibration. All these expansions of Kṛṣṇa in the material world are simply demonstrations of the Lord's mercy and willingness to give facility to His devotees who are engaged in His devotional service within the material world.
