This is a quotation from //Bhāvārtha-dīpikā,// Śrīdhara Svāmī's commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.1.1). In the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is a description of the //āśraya-tattva,// Śrī Kṛṣṇa. There are two //tattvas-āśraya-tattva// and //āśrita-tattva. Āśraya-tattva// is the objective, and //āśrita-tattva// is the subjective. Since the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa are the shelter of all devotees, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called //paraṁ dhāma.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is stated: //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.// Everything is resting under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.14.58) it is stated:

> samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ
> mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo-murāreḥ

Under the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the entire //mahat-tattva// is existing. Since everything is under Śrī Kṛṣṇa's protection, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called //āśraya-tattva.// Everything else is called //āśrita-tattva.// The material creation is also called //āśrita-tattva.// Liberation from material bondage and the attainment of the spiritual platform are also //āśrita-tattva.// Kṛṣṇa is the only //āśraya-tattva.// In the beginning of the creation there are Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. They are also //āśraya-tattva.// Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes (//sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam).// To understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly, one has to make an analytical study of //āśraya-tattva// and //āśrita-tattva.//
