While marking the body with //tilaka,// one should chant the following //mantra,// which consists of the twelve names of Lord Viṣṇu.

> lalāṭe keśavaṁ dhyāyen
> nārāyaṇam athodare
> vakṣaḥ-sthale mādhavaṁ tu
> govindaṁ kaṇṭha-kūpake
>
> viṣṇuṁ ca dakṣiṇe kukṣau
> bāhau ca madhusūdanam
> trivikramaṁ kandhare tu
> vāmanaṁ vāma-pārśvake
>
> śrīdharaṁ vāma-bāhau tu
> hṛṣīkeśaṁ tu kandhare
> pṛṣṭhe ca padmanābhaṁ ca
> kaṭyāṁ dāmodaraṁ nyaset

"When one marks the forehead with //tilaka,// he must remember Keśava. When one marks the lower abdomen, he must remember Nārāyaṇa. For the chest, one should remember Mādhava, and when marking the hollow of the neck one should remember Govinda. Lord Viṣṇu should be remembered while marking the right side of the belly, and Madhusūdana should be remembered when marking the right arm. Trivikrama should be remembered when marking the right shoulder, and Vāmana should be remembered when marking the left side of the belly. Śrīdhara should be remembered while marking the left arm, and Hṛṣīkeśa should be remembered when marking the left shoulder. Padmanābha and Dāmodara should be remembered when marking the back."
