It appears from this statement that Sanātana Gosvāmī, who was formerly a minister of the Nawab, was trying to cheat the Mohammedan superintendent. A jail superintendent had only an ordinary education, or practically no education, and he was certainly not supposed to be very advanced in spiritual knowledge. However, just to satisfy him, Sanātana Gosvāmī praised him as a very learned scholar of the scriptures. The jailkeeper could not deny that he was a learned scholar because when one is elevated to an exalted position, one thinks oneself fit for that position. Sanātana Gosvāmī was correctly explaining the effects of spiritual activity, and the jailkeeper connected his statement with his release from jail. There are innumerable conditioned souls rotting in the material world, imprisoned by //māyā// under the spell of sense gratification. The living entity is so entranced by the spell of //māyā// that in conditioned life even a pig feels satisfied.

There are two kinds of covering powers exhibited by //māyā.// One is called //prakṣepātmikā,// and the other is called //āvaraṇātmikā.// When one is determined to get out of material bondage, the //prakṣepātmikā-śakti,// the spell of diversion, impels one to remain in conditioned life fully satisfied by sense gratification. Due to the other power (//āvaraṇātmikā),// a conditioned soul feels satisfied even if he is rotting in the body of a pig or a worm in stool. To release a conditioned soul from material bondage is very difficult because the spell of //māyā// is so strong. Even when the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself descends to deliver conditioned souls, asking them to surrender unto Him, the conditioned souls do not agree to the Lord's proposals. Therefore Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "Somehow or other, if one helps another gain release from the bondage of //māyā,// he is certainly recognized immediately by the Supreme Personality of Godhead." As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:69|(Bg. 18.69)]]:

> na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu
> kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ
> bhavitā na ca me tasmād
> anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi

The greatest service one can render to the Lord is to try to infuse devotional service into the heart of the conditioned soul so that the conditioned soul may be released from conditional life. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said that a Vaiṣṇava is recognized by his preaching work---that is, by convincing the conditioned soul about his eternal position, which is explained here as //nija-dharma.// It is the living entity's eternal position to serve the Lord; therefore to help one get release from material bondage is to awaken one to the dormant understanding that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. //jīvera 'svarūpa' haya-kṛṣṇera 'nitya-dāsa'.// This will be further explained by the Lord Himself to Sanātana Gosvāmī.
