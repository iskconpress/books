{{description>" 'One may be born in a brāhmaṇa family and have all twelve brahminical qualities, but if he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has a navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a caṇḍāla who has dedicated his mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a śva-paca or caṇḍāla is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family.'

**“ 'One may be born in a brāhmaṇa family and have all twelve brahminical qualities, but if he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has a navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a caṇḍāla who has dedicated his mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a śva-paca or caṇḍāla is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family.'

===== Purport =====

This verse is spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:9:10|(7.9.10)]]. A //brāhmaṇa// is supposed to be qualified with twelve qualities. As stated in the //Mahābhārata://

> dharmaś ca satyaṁ ca damas tapaś ca
> amātsaryaṁ hrīs titikṣānasūyā
> yajñaś ca dānaṁ ca dhṛtiḥ śrutaṁ ca
> vratāni vai dvādaśa brāhmaṇasya

"A //brāhmaṇa// must be perfectly religious. He must be truthful, and he must be able to control his senses. He must execute severe austerities, and he must be detached, humble and tolerant. He must not envy anyone, and he must be expert in performing sacrifices and giving whatever he has in charity. He must be fixed in devotional service and expert in the knowledge of the //Vedas.// These are the twelve qualifications for a //brāhmaṇa."//

Bhagavad-gītā describes the brahminical qualities in this way:

> śamo damas tapaḥ śaucam
> kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca
> jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ
> brahma-karma svabhāva-jam

"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness---these are the qualities by which the //brāhmaṇas// work." [[books:bg:18:42|(Bg. 18.42)]]

In the //Muktāphala-ṭīkā,// it is said:

> śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ
> kṣānty-ārjava-virakta yaḥ
> jñāna-vijñāna-santoṣāḥ
> satyāstikye dviṣaḍ guṇāḥ

"Mental equilibrium, sense control, austerity, cleanliness, tolerance, simplicity, detachment, theoretical and practical knowledge, satisfaction, truthfulness and firm faith in the //Vedas// are the twelve qualities of a //brāhmaṇa."//
