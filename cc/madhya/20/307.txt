===== Purport =====

This is a description of the Rudra form, which is another expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Only //viṣṇu-mūrtis// are expansions of Kṛṣṇa's personal and plenary portions. Mahā Viṣṇu, who lies on the Causal Ocean, is an expansion of Saṅkarṣaṇa. When Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu accepts the material modes of nature for the purpose of dissolving the cosmic manifestation, His form is called Rudra. As already explained, Lord Viṣṇu is the controller of //māyā.// How, then, can He associate with //māyā//? The conclusion is that the incarnation of Lord Śiva or Lord Brahmā indicates the absence of the supreme power of Viṣṇu. When the supreme power is not there, it is possible to associate with //māyā,// the external energy. Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are to be considered creations of //māyā.//
