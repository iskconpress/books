**"There are innumerable incarnations of Kṛṣṇa, and there is no possibility of counting them. We can simply indicate them by giving the example of the moon and the branches of a tree.**

===== Purport =====

Although the moon appears to be located in the branches of a tree, it is actually situated very far away. Similarly, none of the //avatāras,// or incarnations, of Lord Kṛṣṇa are within this material world, but they are visible by the causeless mercy of the Lord. We should not consider them to belong to this material world. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā://

"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be." [[books:bg:9:11|(Bg. 9.11)]]

//Avatāras// descend of their own free will, and although they may act like ordinary human beings, they do not belong to this material world. Lord Kṛṣṇa and His //avatāras// can be understood only by the grace of the Lord.
