===== Purport =====

This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.27). The //śyāma// color is not exactly blackish. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura compares it to the color of the //atasī// flower. It is not that Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appears in a blackish color in all the Dvāpara-yugas. In other Dvāpara-yugas, previous to Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearance, the Supreme Lord appeared in a greenish body by His own personal expansion. This is mentioned in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Hari-vaṁśa// and //Mahābhārata.//
