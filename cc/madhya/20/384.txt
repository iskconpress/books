**"Lord Kṛṣṇa exhibits His pastimes of childhood, boyhood and pre-youth. When He reaches pre-youth, He continues to exist eternally to perform His rāsa dance and other pastimes.**

===== Purport =====

The comparison made here is very interesting. Kṛṣṇa does not grow like an ordinary human being, even though He exhibits His pastimes of childhood, boyhood and pre-youth. When He reaches the age of pre-youth, //kaiśora,// He does not grow any older. He simply remains in His //kaiśora// age. He is therefore described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33) as //nava-yauvana.//

> advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

This //nava-yauvana,// or pre-youth, is the eternal transcendental form of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa never grows older than //nava-yauvana.//
