===== Purport =====

Of the three deities supervising the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe, Lord Viṣṇu is never separate from the original Viṣṇu. However, Lord Śiva and Brahmā, due to their association with //māyā,// are different from Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu cannot be transformed into any form of material energy. Whenever there is association with //māyā,// the personality involved must be different from Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are called //guṇa-avatāras,// for they associate with the material qualities. The conclusion is that Rudra is a transformation of Viṣṇu, but he is not exactly Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore, he does not come within the category of the //viṣṇu-tattvas.// Thus he is inconceivably one with Viṣṇu and different from Him. The example given in this verse is very clear. Milk is compared to Viṣṇu. As soon as milk touches a sour substance, it becomes yogurt, or Lord Śiva. Although yogurt is constitutionally milk it cannot be used in place of milk.
