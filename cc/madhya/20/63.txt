As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati.// Staying within everyone's heart, Lord Kṛṣṇa works very gravely. No one can understand how He is working, but as soon as the Lord understands the sincere activity of a person in devotional service, He helps him in such a way that the devotee cannot understand how things are happening. If the devotee is determined to serve the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to help him (//dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te).// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is telling Sanātana Gosvāmī how merciful the Lord is. Sanātana Gosvāmī was a minister in the service of Nawab Hussain Shah. He was always mixing with people materially inclined, particularly with Mohammedans, meat-eaters. Although he was in intimate touch with them, by Kṛṣṇa's mercy he came to find such association distasteful. Therefore he left them. As stated by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya: //tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-man-dala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.// Kṛṣṇa enlightened Sanātana Gosvāmī in such a way that he was able to give up his exalted post as minister. Thinking his material position insignificant, Sanātana was prepared to become a mendicant. Appreciating the activities of Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu praised his action and thanked Kṛṣṇa for His mercy upon him.
