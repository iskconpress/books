According to //Bhagavad-gītā://

> mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke
> jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ
> manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
> prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." [[books:bg:15:7|(Bg. 15.7)]]

The word //prakṛti-sparśana// is explained in //Caitanya-caritamṛta// in reference to the way the living entities come in contact with dull matter. The glancing is performed by Mahā-Viṣṇu: //sa aikṣata lokān nu sṛjā iti// (//Aitareya Upaniṣad// 1.1.1). In the conditional stage we impregnate according to the bodily conception---that is, by sexual intercourse---but the Supreme Lord does not need sexual intercourse to impregnate. The impregnation is performed simply by His glance. This is also explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.32):

> aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti
> paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti
> ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

Govinda can impregnate simply by glancing. In other words, His eyes can work as His genitals. He does not need genitals to beget a child. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa can beget any one of the living entities with any part of His body.

The word //svāṅga-viśeṣābhāsa-rūpe,// the form by which the Lord begets living entities in the material world, is explained herein. He is Lord Śiva. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is stated that Lord Śiva, who is another form of Mahā-Viṣṇu, is like yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. Similarly, Lord Śiva is considered the father of this universe, and material nature is considered the mother. The father and mother are known as Lord Śiva and the goddess Durgā. Together, Lord Śiva's genitals and the vagina of goddess Durgā are worshiped as //śiva-liṅga.// This is the origin of the material creation. Thus Lord Śiva's position is between the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Lord Śiva is neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor the living entity. He is the form through which the Supreme Lord works to beget living entities within this material world. As yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Lord Śiva expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. The impregnation of material nature by the father, Lord Śiva, is wonderful because at one time innumerable living entities are conceived. //Bhāgo jīvaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ sa cānantyāya kalpate// (//Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// 5.9). These living entities are very, very small.

> keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya
> śatāṁśa-sadṛśātmakaḥ
> jīvaḥ sūkṣma-svarūpo 'yam
> saṅkhyātīto hi cit-kaṇaḥ

"If we divide the tip of a hair into a hundred parts and then take one of these parts and divide it again into a hundred parts, that very fine division is the size of but one of the numberless living entities. They are all //cit-kaṇa,// particles of spirit, not matter."

The innumerable //brahmāṇḍas,// or universes, come from the pores of the Lord's body, and innumerable living entities also come from the pores of the transcendental body of the Lord. This is the process of material creation. Without the living entity, this material nature has no value. Both emanate from the pores of the transcendental body of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. They are different energies. That is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā://

> bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ
> khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca
> ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me
> bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā

"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-all together these eight comprise My separated material energies." [[books:bg:7:4|(Bg. 7.4)]] The material elements also come from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they are also a different type of energy. Although the living entities also come from the Lord's body, they are categorized as a superior energy.

> apareyam itas tv anyāṁ
> prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām
> jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho
> yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat

"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." [[books:bg:7:5|(Bg. 7.5)]] The inferior energy, matter, cannot act without the superior energy. All these things are very clearly explained in the //Vedas.// The materialistic theory that life develops from matter is incorrect. Life and matter come from the supreme living entity; therefore, being the source of both, that supreme living entity, Kṛṣṇa, is described in //Vedānta-sūtra// as //janmādy asya yataḥ// (1.1), or the original source of everything, //sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.// This is further explained in the following verse.
