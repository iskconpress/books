One day of Brahmā consists of the four //yugas// multiplied a thousand times-or, according to solar calculations, 4,320,000,000 years-and such also is the duration of his night. One year of Brahmā's life consists of 360 days and nights, and Brahmā lives for one hundred such years. Such is the life of a Brahmā.
