===== Purport =====

In Orissa most of the //brāhmaṇas// have the title Dāsa. Generally it is understood that the word //dāsa// refers to those other than the //brāhmaṇas,// but in Orissa the //brāhmaṇas// use the Dāsa title. This is confirmed by Culli Bhaṭṭa. Actually, everyone is //dāsa// because everyone is a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In that sense, the bona fide //brāhmaṇa// has first claim to the appellation //dāsa.// Therefore in this case the designation //dāsa// is not incompatible.
