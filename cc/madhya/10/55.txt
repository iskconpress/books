This is the process of surrender. As Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings:

> mānasa, deha, geha, yo kichu mora
> arpiluṅ tuyā pade nanda-kiśora!

(//Śaraṇāgati//)

When one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, he does so with everything in his possession-his house, his body, his mind and whatever else he possesses. If there is any obstruction to this surrendering process, one should immediately give it up without attachment. If one can surrender with all his family members, there is no need to take //sannyāsa.// However, if the surrendering process is hampered by so-called family members, one should immediately give them up to complete the surrendering process.
