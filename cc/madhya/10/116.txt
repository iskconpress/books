Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī was very expert in music as well as the Vedic scriptures. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to call him Dāmodara because of his expert singing and musical skills. The name Dāmodara was given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and added to the name given by his //sannyāsa-guru.// He was therefore known as Svarūpa Dāmodara, or Dāmodara Svarūpa. He compiled a book of music named //Saṅgīta-dāmodara.//
