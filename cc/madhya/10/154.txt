===== Purport =====

Brahmānanda Bhāratī belonged to the Śaṅkara-sampradāya. (The title //bhāratī// indicates a member of one of that //sampradāya's// ten classes of //sannyāsīs//.) It is customary for a person who has renounced the world to cover his body with a deerskin or the bark of a tree. This is enjoined by the //Manu-saṁhitā.// But if a //sannyāsī// who has renounced the world simply wears a deerskin and does not spiritually advance, he is bewildered by false prestige. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like to see Brahmānanda Bhāratī wearing a deerskin.
