This is the way to advance in spiritual science. One must accept the words of an //ācārya,// a bona fide spiritual master, to clear the path for spiritual advancement. This is the secret of success. However, one's guide must be a spiritual master who is actually an unalloyed devotee strictly following the instructions of the previous //ācārya// without deviation. Whatever the spiritual master says must be accepted by the disciple. Only then is success certain. This is the Vedic system.

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was a //brāhmaṇa// and a realized soul, whereas Pratāparudra was a //kṣatriya. Kṣatriya// kings used to obey very faithfully the orders of learned //brāhmaṇas// and saintly persons, and in this way they would rule their country. Similarly, //vaiśyas// used to follow the king's orders, and //śūdras// used to serve the three higher castes. In this way the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras// used to live cooperatively, performing their respective duties. Consequently society was peaceful, and people were able to discharge the duties of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus they were happy in this life and able to return home, back to Godhead.
