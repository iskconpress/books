Brahmānanda Bhāratī wanted to prove that there is no difference between the Supreme Lord and the //jīva,// while Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to prove that He and Brahmānanda Bhāratī were //jīvas// and that although the //jīvas// are Brahman, they are many, but the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Brahman, is one. On the other hand, Brahmānanda Bhāratī also wanted to prove that Jagannātha and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are one, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but that to fulfill His mission Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared to be moving whereas Lord Jagannātha appeared to be inert. Thus this jolly argument was going on. Finally, Brahmānanda Bhāratī referred the whole matter to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya for a final decision.
