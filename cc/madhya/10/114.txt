===== Purport =====

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that if something impedes the execution of devotional service, it should be understood to be impure. Pure devotees of the Lord do not accept impure principles. Impure devotees accept //rasābhāsa,// or overlapping, contradictory mellows, and other principles opposed to the //bhakti// path. The followers of such impure principles are never accepted as pure devotees. There are many parties following the path of //rasābhāsa,// and the followers are sometimes adored by ordinary men. Those who adopt the conclusions of //rasābhāsa// and //bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha// are never accepted as devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī never approved such followers as Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, nor did he allow them even to meet the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
