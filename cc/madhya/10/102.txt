"Svarūpa" is one of the names of a //brahmacārī// in Śaṅkarācārya's disciplic succession. In the Vedic discipline there are ten names for //sannyāsīs,// and it is customary for a //brahmacārī// assisting a //sannyāsī// of the designation Tīrtha or Āśrama to receive the title Svarūpa. Dāmodara Svarūpa was formerly a resident of Navadvīpa, and his name was Puruṣottama Ācārya. When he went to Vārāṇasī, he took //sannyāsa// from a //sannyāsī// designated Tīrtha. Although he received the title Svarūpa in his //brahmacārī// stage, he did not change his name when he took //sannyāsa.// Actually as a //sannyāsī// he should have been called Tīrtha, but he chose to retain his original //brahmacārī// title as Svarūpa.
