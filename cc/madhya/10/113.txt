===== Purport =====

Bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha refers to that which is against the principle of unity in diversity, philosophically known as //acintya-bhedābheda//-simultaneous oneness and difference-while //rasābhāsa// is something that may appear to be a transcendental mellow but actually is not. Those who are pure Vaiṣṇavas should avoid both these things opposed to devotional service. These misconceptions practically parallel the Māyāvāda philosophy. If one indulges in Māyāvāda philosophy, he gradually falls down from the platform of devotional service. By overlapping mellows (//rasābhāsa//) one eventually becomes a //prākṛta-sahajiyā// and takes everything to be very easy. One may also become a member of the //bāula// community and gradually become attracted to material activities. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore advised us to avoid //bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha// and //rasābhāsa.// In this way the devotee can remain pure and free from falldowns. Everyone should try to remain aloof from //bhakti-siddhānta-viruddha// and //rasābhāsa.//
