In the scriptures it is stated: //ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ.// A qualified //brāhmaṇa// must be expert in the occupational duties of a //brāhmaṇa.// His duties are mentioned as six brahminical engagements. //Paṭhana// means that a //brāhmaṇa// must be conversant with the Vedic scriptures. He must also be able to teach others to study the Vedic scriptures. This is //pāṭhana.// He must also be expert in worshiping different deities and in performing the Vedic rituals (//yajana//). On account of this //yajana,// the //brāhmaṇa,// being the head of society, performs all the Vedic rituals for //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,// and //śūdras.// This is called //yājana,// assisting others in performing ceremonies. The remaining two items are //dāna// and //pratigraha.// The //brāhmaṇa// accepts all kinds of contributions (//pratigraha//) from his followers (namely, the //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras//). But he does not keep all the money. He keeps only as much as required and gives the balance to others in charity (//dāna//).

In order for such a qualified //brāhmaṇa// to worship the Deity, he must be a Vaiṣṇava. Thus the Vaiṣṇava's position is superior to that of the //brāhmaṇa.// This example given by Mādhavendra Purī confirms that even though a //brāhmaṇa// may be very expert, he cannot become a priest or servitor of the //viṣṇu-mūrti// unless he is initiated in //vaiṣṇava-mantra.// After installing the Deity of Gopāla, Mādhavendra Purī initiated all the //brāhmaṇas// into Vaiṣṇavism. He then allotted the //brāhmaṇas// different types of service to the Deity. From four in the morning until ten at night (from //maṅgala-ārātrika// to //śayana-ārātrika//), there must be at least five or six //brāhmaṇas// to take care of the Deity. Six //ārātrikas// are performed in the temple, and food is frequently offered to the Deity and the //prasāda// distributed. This is the method of worshiping the Deity according to the rules and regulations set by predecessors. Our //sampradāya// belongs to the disciplic succession of Mādhavendra Purī, who belonged to the Madhva-sampradāya. We are in the disciplic succession of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was initiated by Śrī Īśvara Purī, a disciple of Mādhavendra Purī's. Our //sampradāya// is therefore called the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. As such, we must carefully follow in the footsteps of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and observe how he installed the Gopāla Deity on top of Govardhana Hill, how he arranged and performed the Annakūṭa ceremony in only one day, and so forth. Our installation of Deities in America and in the wealthy countries of Europe should be carried out in terms of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī's activities. All the servitors of the Deity must be strictly qualified as //brāhmaṇas// and, specifically, must engage in the Vaiṣṇava custom of offering as much //prasāda// as possible and distributing it to the devotees who visit the temple to see the Lord.
