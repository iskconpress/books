This is the //paramahaṁsa// stage, the highest stage for a //sannyāsī.// A //sannyāsī// can beg from door to door just to collect food, but a //paramahaṁsa// who has taken //ayācita-vṛtti,// or //ājagara-vṛtti,// does not ask anyone for food. If someone offers him food voluntarily, he eats. //Ayācita-vṛtti// means being accustomed to refrain from begging, and //ājagara-vṛtti// indicates one who is compared to a python, the big snake that makes no effort to acquire food but rather allows food to come automatically within its mouth. In other words, a //paramahaṁsa// simply engages exclusively in the service of the Lord without caring even for eating or sleeping. It was stated about the six Gosvāmīs: //nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// In the //paramahaṁsa// stage one conquers the desire for sleep, food and sense gratification. One remains a humble, meek mendicant engaged in the service of the Lord day and night. Mādhavendra Purī had attained this //paramahaṁsa// stage.
