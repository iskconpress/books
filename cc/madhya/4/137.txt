===== Purport =====

A devotee can bring Kṛṣṇa perfectly under his control. This is explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.14.3): //ajita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām.// Kṛṣṇa is never conquered by anyone, but a devotee can conquer Him through devotional service. As stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33): //vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau.// One cannot understand Kṛṣṇa simply by reading Vedic literature. Although all Vedic literature is meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa without being a lover of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore along with the reading of Vedic literature (//svādhyāya//), one must engage in devotional worship of the Deity (//arcana-vidhi//). Together these will enhance the devotee's transcendental understanding of devotional service. //Śravaṇādi śuddha-citte karaye udaya// [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|(Cc. Madhya 22.107)]]. Love of Godhead is dormant within everyone's heart, and if one simply follows the standard process of devotional service, it is awakened. But foolish mundane people who simply read about Kṛṣṇa mistakenly think that He is immoral or criminal.
