This is the way to install the Deity, construct the temple and increase the property of the temple. Everyone should be enthusiastic to contribute to the construction of the temple for the Deity, and everyone should also contribute food for the distribution of //prasāda.// The devotees should preach the gospel of devotional service and thus engage people in practical service to the Deity. Wealthy people can also be attracted to take part in these activities. In this way everyone will become spiritually inclined, and the entire society will be converted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The desire to satisfy the material senses will automatically diminish, and the senses will become so purified that they will be able to engage in //bhakti// (devotional service to the Lord). //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.// By serving the Lord, one's senses are gradually purified. The engagement of one's purified senses in the service of Lord Hṛṣīkeśa is called //bhakti.// When the dormant propensity for //bhakti// is awakened, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ.// [[books:bg:18:55|(Bg. 18.55)]] This is the process of giving humanity the chance to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus people can perfect their lives in all respects.
