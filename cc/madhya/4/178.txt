When the living entity feels spiritual separation from Kṛṣṇa (//kṛṣṇa-viraha//), he has achieved the prime success of life. When one becomes disinterested in material things, he is simply experiencing the other side of attraction for material things. However, feeling separation from Kṛṣṇa and engaging in the service of the Lord to fulfill His mission constitute the best example of love of Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to point out this intense love of Kṛṣṇa exhibited by Mādhavendra Purī. All Caitanya Mahāprabhu's devotees later followed in the footsteps of Mādhavendra Purī, serving the Lord without personal considerations.
