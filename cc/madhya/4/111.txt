In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments that Advaita Ācārya took initiation from Mādhavendra Purī, who was a //sannyāsī// in the disciplic succession of the Madhva-sampradāya. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya,
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru' haya

"A person may be a //brāhmaṇa,// a //sannyāsī,// a //śūdra// or whatever, but if he is well conversant in the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can become a //guru.//"(Cc. Madhya 8.128) This statement is supported by Śrī Mādhavendra Purī. According to the //pañcarātra// injunction, only a householder //brāhmaṇa// can initiate. Others cannot. When a person is initiated, it is assumed that he has become a //brāhmaṇa;// without being initiated by a proper //brāhmaṇa,// one cannot be converted into a //brāhmaṇa.// In other words, unless one is a //brāhmaṇa,// he cannot make another a //brāhmaṇa.// A //gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa// partaking of the //varṇāśrama-dharma// institution can secure various types of paraphernalia to worship Lord Viṣṇu through his honest labor. Actually, people beg to be initiated by these householder //brāhmaṇas// just to become successful in the //varṇāśrama// institution or to become free from material desires. It is therefore necessary for a spiritual master in the //gṛhastha-āśrama// to be a strict Vaiṣṇava. A spiritual master from the //sannyāsa// order has very little opportunity to perform //arcana,// Deity worship, but when one accepts a spiritual master from the transcendental //sannyāsīs,// the principle of Deity worship is not at all neglected. To implement this conclusion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave us His opinion in the verse //kibā vipra kibā nyāsī,// etc. This indicates that the Lord understood the weakness of society in its maintaining that only a //gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa// should be a spiritual master. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu indicated that it does not matter whether the spiritual master is a //gṛhastha// (householder), a //sannyāsī// or even a //śūdra.// A spiritual master simply must be conversant in the essence of the //śāstra;// he must understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only then can one become a spiritual master. //Dīkṣā// actually means initiating a disciple with transcendental knowledge by which he becomes freed from all material contamination.
