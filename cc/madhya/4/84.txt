**All the people gathered there sat down to honor the prasāda, and by and by they took food. All the brāhmaṇas and their wives were fed first.**

===== Purport =====

According to the //varṇāśrama// system, the //brāhmaṇas// are always honored first. Thus at the festival, the //brāhmaṇas// and their wives were first offered the remnants of food, and then the others (//kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras//). This has always been the system, and it is still prevalent in India, even though the caste //brāhmaṇas// are not qualified. The system is still current due to the //varṇāśrama// institutional rules and regulations.
