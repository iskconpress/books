In his commentary on this occasion, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes from the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.// Barley powder, wheat powder, vermilion powder, //urad dāl// powder and another powder preparation called //āvāṭā// (made by mixing banana powder and ground rice) are applied to the Deity's body with a brush made from the hair at the end of a cow's tail. This produces a nice finish. The oil smeared over the body of the Deity should be scented. To perform the //mahā-snāna,// at least two and a half //mānas// (about twenty-four gallons) of water are needed to pour over the body of the Deity.
