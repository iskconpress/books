**Those who were acquainted with government officers met with them and begged for camphor and sandalwood, which they collected.**

===== Purport =====

It appears that //malayaja-candana// (sandalwood) and camphor were used for the Jagannātha Deity. The camphor was used in His //ārātrika,// and the sandalwood was used to smear His body. Both these items were under government control; therefore the devotees had to meet with the government officials. Informing them of all the details, they attained permission to take the sandalwood and camphor outside Jagannātha Purī.
