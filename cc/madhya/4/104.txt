===== Purport =====

The six Gosvāmīs and their followers started many temples, such as  the temples of Govinda, Gopīnātha, Madana-mohana, Rādhā-Dāmodara, Śyāmasundara, Rādhā-ramaṇa and Gokulānanda. The disciples of the Gosvāmīs were entrusted with the //sevā-pūjā// (Deity worship) of these temples. It was not that the disciples were family members of the original Gosvāmīs. All the Gosvāmīs were in the renounced order of life, and Jīva Gosvāmī in particular was a lifelong //brahmacārī.// At present, //sevāitas// assume the title of //gosvāmī// on the basis of their being engaged as //sevāitas// of the Deity. The //sevāitas// who have inherited their positions now assume proprietorship of the temples, and some of them are selling the Deities' property as if it were their own. However, the temples did not originally belong to these //sevāitas.//
