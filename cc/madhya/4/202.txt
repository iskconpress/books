===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, jāḍya// is explained as loss of memory brought about by severe shock due to separation from the beloved. In that state of mind, one loses all concern for loss and gain, hearing and seeing, as well as all other considerations. This marks the preliminary appearance of illusion.
