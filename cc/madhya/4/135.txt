===== Purport =====

A //brāhmaṇa// is not supposed to offer his obeisances by falling flat before anyone because a //brāhmaṇa// is considered to be in the highest caste. However, when a //brāhmaṇa// sees a devotee, he offers his //daṇḍavats.// This //brāhmaṇa// priest did not ask Mādhavendra Purī whether he was a //brāhmaṇa,// but when he saw that Mādhavendra Purī was such a bona fide devotee that Kṛṣṇa would even steal for him, he immediately understood the position of the saint. As stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru' haya.// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|(Cc. Madhya 8.128)]] Had the //brāhmaṇa// priest been an ordinary //brāhmaṇa,// Gopīnātha would not have talked with him in a dream. Since the Deity spoke to both Mādhavendra Purī and the //brāhmaṇa// priest in dreams, practically speaking they were on the same platform. However, because Mādhavendra Purī was a senior //sannyāsī// Vaiṣṇava, a //paramahaṁsa,// the priest immediately fell flat before him and offered obeisances.
