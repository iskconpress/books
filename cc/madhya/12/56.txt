In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.78.36) it is said: //ātmā vai putra utpanna iti vedānuśāsanam.// The //Vedas// enjoin that one is born as his own son. The son is nondifferent from the father, and this is admitted in every revealed scripture. In Christian theology it is believed that Christ, the son of God, is also God. Both of them are identical.
