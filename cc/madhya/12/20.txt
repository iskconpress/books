In India there is still a class of professional mendicants who are very much like the gypsies of Western countries. They know some magical art and mystical processes, and their business is to beg from door to door, sometimes pleading and sometimes threatening. Such mendicants are sometimes called //yogīs// and sometimes //kāṇaphāṭā yogīs.// The word //kāṇaphāṭā// refers to one who has put a hole in his ear to wear an earring made of ivory. Mahārāja Pratāparudra was so depressed by not getting to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that he decided to become such a //yogī.// Ordinary men think that a //yogī// must have an ivory earring in his ear, but this is not the sign of a real //yogī.// Mahārāja Pratāparudra also thought that to become a mendicant //yogī,// one must wear such an earring.
