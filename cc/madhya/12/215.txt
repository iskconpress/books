In the //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// (1.5.538), Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described the beauty of the Lord in this way:

> asamānordhva-mādhurya-
> taraṅgāmṛta-vāridhiḥ
> jaṅgama-sthāvarollāsi-
> rūpo gopendra-nandanaḥ

"The beauty of the son of Mahārāja Nanda is incomparable. Nothing is higher than His beauty, and nothing can equal it. His beauty is like waves in an ocean of nectar. This beauty is attractive both for moving and for nonmoving objects."

Similarly, in the //Tantra-śāstra,// there is another description of the Lord's beauty:

> kandarpa-koṭy-arbuda-rūpa-śobha-
> nīrājya-pādābja-nakhāṁ calasya
> kutrāpy adṛṣṭa-śruta-ramya-kānter
> dhyānaṁ paraṁ nanda-sutasya vakṣye

"I shall relate the supreme meditation upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja. The tips of the toes of His lotus feet reflect the beauty of the bodies of unlimited millions of Cupids, and His bodily luster has never been seen or heard of anywhere."

One may also consult //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.29.14) in this connection.
