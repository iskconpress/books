===== Purport =====

This refers to the day Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His cowherd boys and flocks of animals were present on the pasturing grounds near Mathurā. At that time the cowherd boys, being a little hungry, requested food, and Lord Kṛṣṇa asked them to go to the //brāhmaṇas// who were engaged nearby in performing //yajña,// or sacrifice, and to get some food from that //yajña.// Being so ordered by the Lord, all the cowherd boys went to the //brāhmaṇas// and asked them for food, but they were denied. After this, the cowherd boys begged food from the wives of the //brāhmaṇas.// All these wives were very much devoted to Lord Kṛṣṇa in spontaneous love, and as soon as they heard the request of the cowherd boys and understood that Kṛṣṇa wanted some food, they immediately left the place of sacrifice. They were very much chastised for this by their husbands, and they were ready to give up their lives. It is the nature of a pure devotee to sacrifice his life for the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
