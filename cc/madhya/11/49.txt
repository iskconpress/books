===== Purport =====

This is an excellent example of //dṛḍha-vrata,// determination. If one does not receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy, one's life is defeated. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:5:5|(5.5.5)]] it is said: //parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.// Unless one inquires into spiritual life, everything is useless. Without spiritual inquiry, our labor and the object of our labor are simply a waste of time.
