===== Purport =====

A Vaiṣṇava is always ready to help another Vaiṣṇava progress toward realization of the Absolute Truth. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya could understand the King's position as a pure Vaiṣṇava. The King was always thinking of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to help him approach the Lord. A Vaiṣṇava is always compassionate, especially when he sees a prospective devotee very much determined (//dṛḍha-vrata//). Consequently the Bhaṭṭācārya was ready to help the King.
