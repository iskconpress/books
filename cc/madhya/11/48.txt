===== Purport =====

A devotee with Mahārāja Pratāparudra's determination will certainly be victorious in advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Kṛṣṇa confirms this in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:14|(Bg. 9.14)]]:

> satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ
> yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā
> nitya-yuktā upāsate

"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."

These are the symptoms of a //mahātmā// engaged in the Lord's service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus Mahārāja Pratāparudra's determination is very much exalted and is called //dṛḍha-vrata.// Because of this determination, he was finally able to receive Lord Caitanya's direct mercy.
