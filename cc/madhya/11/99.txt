===== Purport =====

Rascals propose that anyone can invent his own religious process, and this proposition is condemned herein. If one actually wants to become religious, he must take up the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// The real meaning of religion is stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|(6.3.19-22)]].

> dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītaṁ
> na vai vidur ṛṣayo nāpi devāḥ
> na siddha-mukhyā asurā manuṣyāḥ
> kuto nu vidyādhara-cāraṇādayaḥ
>
> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
>
> dvādaśaite vijānīmo
> dharmaṁ bhāgavataṁ bhaṭāḥ
> guhyaṁ viśuddhaṁ durbodhaṁ
> yaṁ jñātvāmṛtam aśnute
>
> etāvān eva loke 'smin
> puṁsāṁ dharmaḥ paraḥ smṛtaḥ
> bhakti-yogo bhagavati
> tan-nāma-grahaṇādibhiḥ

The purport of these verses is that //dharma,// or religion, cannot be manufactured by a human being. Religion is the law or code of the Lord. Consequently religion cannot be manufactured even by great saintly persons, demigods or //siddha-mukhyas,// and what to speak of //asuras,// human beings, Vidyādharas, Cāraṇas, and so on. The principles of //dharma,// religion, come down in the //paramparā// system beginning with twelve personalities-namely, Lord Brahmā; the great saint Nārada; Lord Śiva; the four Kumāras; Kapila, the son of Devahūti; Svāyambhuva Manu; Prahlāda Mahārāja; King Janaka; grandfather Bhīṣma; Bali Mahārāja; Śukadeva Gosvāmī; and Yamarāja. The principles of religion are known to these twelve personalities. //Dharma// refers to the religious principles by which one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Dharma// is very confidential, uncontaminated by any material influence, and very difficult for ordinary men to understand. However, if one actually understands //dharma,// he immediately becomes liberated and is transferred to the kingdom of God. //Bhāgavata-dharma,// or the principle of religion enunciated by the //paramparā// system, is the supreme principle of religion. In other words, //dharma// refers to the science of //bhakti-yoga,// which begins by the novice's chanting the holy name of the Lord (//tan-nāma-grahaṇādibhiḥ//).

Therefore in this Age of Kali, as recommended here in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:11:98|(text 98)]], //kali-kāle dharma-kṛṣṇa-nāma-saṅkīrtana:// the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is the method of religion approved by all Vedic scriptures. In the next text of the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.32), this principle is further stressed.
