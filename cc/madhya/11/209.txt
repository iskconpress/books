===== Purport =====

It is the practice of Vaiṣṇavas while taking //prasāda// to chant the holy name of Lord Hari at intervals and also sing various songs, such as //śarīra avidyā-jāla.// Those who are honoring //prasāda,// accepting the remnants of food offered to the Deity, must always remember that //prasāda// is not ordinary food. //Prasāda// is transcendental. We are therefore reminded:

> mahā-prasāde govinde
> nāma-brahmaṇi vaiṣṇave
> sv-alpa-puṇya-vatāṁ rājan
> viśvāso naiva jāyate

Those who are not pious cannot understand the value of //mahā-prasāda// or the holy name of the Lord. Both //prasāda// and the Lord's name are on the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform. One should never consider //prasāda// to be like ordinary hotel cooking. Nor should one touch any kind of food not offered to the Deity. Every Vaiṣṇava strictly follows this principle and does not accept any food that is not //prasāda.// One should take //prasāda// with great faith and should chant the holy name of the Lord and worship the Deity in the temple, always remembering that the Deity, //mahā-prasāda// and the holy name do not belong to the mundane platform. By worshiping the Deity, eating //prasāda// and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// one can always remain on the spiritual platform (//brahma-bhūyāya kalpate//).
