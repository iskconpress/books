Vāsudeva Datta was the father of Mukunda Datta, who was the childhood friend of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is naturally a great pleasure to see a friend, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed the father that although it was His pleasure to see His friend, His pleasure was increased by seeing the father.
