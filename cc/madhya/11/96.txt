===== Purport =====

Because the temple of Lord Jagannātha is situated at Jagannātha Purī, many devotees from all parts of the world came to perform //saṅkīrtana// in glorification of the Lord. All these devotees were certainly seen and heard by Mahārāja Pratāparudra, but he herein admits that the //kīrtana// performed by the associates of the Lord was unique. He had never before heard such //saṅkīrtana// nor seen such attractive features manifest by the devotees. The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness should go to India during the birthday ceremony of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Māyāpura and perform //saṅkīrtana// congregationally. This will attract the attention of all the important personalities in India, just as the beauty, bodily luster and //saṅkīrtana// performance by the associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu attracted the attention of Mahārāja Pratāparudra. The associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were unlimited during the Lord's presence on this planet, but anyone who is pure in life and devoted to the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is to be understood as a //nitya-siddha// associate of the Lord.
