===== Purport =====

Actually a //sannyāsī// or a //brāhmaṇa// will not accept an invitation extended by a person born in a lower family. However, there are many devotees who are raised to the platform of //brāhmaṇa// by their initiation. These people are called //śūdra-mahājana.// This indicates that one who is born in a non-//brāhmaṇa// family has accepted the //brāhmaṇa// status by initiation. Such devotees extended invitations to Balabhadra Bhaṭṭācārya. A Māyāvādī //sannyāsī// will accept an invitation only from a //brāhmaṇa// family, but a Vaiṣṇava does not accept an invitation from a //brāhmaṇa// if he does not belong to the Vaiṣṇava sect. However, a Vaiṣṇava will accept an invitation from a //brāhmaṇa// or //śūdra-mahājana// if that person is an initiated Vaiṣṇava. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself accepted invitations from //śūdra-mahājanas,// and this confirms the fact that anyone initiated by a Vaiṣṇava //mantra// can be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa.// One can accept an invitation from such a person.
