===== Purport =====

In northwestern India, //vaiśyas// are divided in various subdivisions. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura points out that they are divided as Āgaraoyālā, Kālaoyāra and Sānoyāḍa. Out of them, the Āgaraoyālās are supposed to be first-class //vaiśyas,// and the Kālaoyāras and Sānoyāḍas are considered lower due to their occupational degradation. The Kālaoyāras generally take wine and other intoxicants. Although they are //vaiśyas,// they are considered to belong to a lower class. The priests who guide the Kālaoyāras and the Sānoyāḍas are called Sanoḍiyā //brāhmaṇas.// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that the word //sānoyāḍa// in Bengal indicates //suvarṇa-vaṇik.// In Bengal there are priests who guide the //suvarṇa-vaṇik// community, which is also considered a low class. There is little difference between the Sānoyāḍa and the //suvarṇa-vaṇik.// Generally the //suvarṇa-vaṇiks// are bankers dealing in gold and silver. In western India, the Āgaraoyālās also belong to the banking profession. This is the original business of the //suvarṇa-vaṇik// or Āgaraoyālā community. Historically, the Āgaraoyālās came from the up-country named Ayodha, and the //suvarṇa-vaṇik// community came from Ayodha. It appears that the //suvarṇa-vaṇiks// and the Āgaraoyālās belong to the same community. The Sanoḍiyā //brāhmaṇas// were the guides of the Kālaoyāra and Sānoyāḍa. They are therefore considered to be lower-class //brāhmaṇas,// and a //sannyāsī// is not allowed to take alms or food from them. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted lunch cooked by a Sanoḍiyā //brāhmaṇa// simply because he belonged to Mādhavendra Purī's community. Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was the spiritual master of Īśvara Purī, who was the spiritual master of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus a spiritual relationship is established on the spiritual platform without consideration of material inferiority or superiority.
