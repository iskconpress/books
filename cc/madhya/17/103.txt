**Every day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu refused their invitation because He feared associating with Māyāvādī sannyāsīs.**

===== Purport =====

A Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// never accepts an invitation from a party who considers Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// and Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// to be one and the same. In other words, Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// do not at all like to associate with Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// to say nothing of eating together. This principle must be followed by the //sannyāsīs// of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu given by His personal behavior.
