Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that although the //brāhmaṇa// did not belong to a superior community, he fearlessly chastised so-called caste //brāhmaṇas// because he was situated on the platform of pure devotional service. There are people who are opposed to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's accepting a Vaiṣṇava belonging to a lower caste. Such people do not consider //mahā-prasāda// transcendental, and therefore they are described here as //mūrkha// (foolish) and //duṣṭa// (mischievous). A pure devotee has the power to challenge such high-caste people, and his brave statements are not to be considered proud or puffed up. On the contrary, he is to be considered straightforward. Such a person does not like to flatter high-class //brāhmaṇas// who belong to the non-Vaiṣṇava community.
