Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as //mahā-vadānya-avatāra,// the most munificent incarnation. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not physically present now, simply by chanting His holy name (//śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda//) people throughout the world are becoming devotees. This is due to the ecstatic chanting of the holy name of the Lord. It is said that a pure devotee can see the Lord every moment, and because of this he is empowered by the Lord. This is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā:premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared five hundred years ago, but it cannot be said that now the potency of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is less powerful than it was in His presence. By hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu through the //paramparā// system, one can be purified. Therefore in this verse it is said: //tathāpi tāṅra darśana-śravaṇa-prabhāve.// It is not that everyone is able to see Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu physically, but if one hears about Him through books like //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// and through the //paramparā// system of pure Vaiṣṇavas, there is no difficulty in becoming a pure Vaiṣṇava, free from mundane desires and personal motivations.
