===== Purport =====

Formerly Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu converted people when He toured southern and western India. Similarly, this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is now delivering the people of the Western world wherever devotees are chanting the holy names. This is all being done by the Lord's mercy. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu predicted that He would deliver people in every city and village of the world by giving them a chance to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//
