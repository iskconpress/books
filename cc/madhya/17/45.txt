===== Translation =====

**When the Lord loudly chanted "Hari bol!" the trees and creepers became jubilant to hear Him.**

===== Purport =====

The loud chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is so powerful that it can even penetrate the ears of trees and creepers-what to speak of animals and human beings. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu once asked Haridāsa Ṭhākura how trees and plants could be delivered, and Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied that the loud chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// would benefit not only trees and plants but insects and all other living beings. One should therefore not be disturbed by the loud chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, for it is beneficial not only to the chanter but to everyone who gets an opportunity to hear.
