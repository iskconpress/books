This is a verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:15:43|(3.15.43)]]. Vidura and Maitreya discussed the pregnancy of Diti. Diti's pregnancy caused the demigods to be very much afraid, and the demigods went to see Lord Brahmā. Lord Brahmā explained the original incident involving the cursing of Jaya and Vijaya by the Catuḥ-sana Kumāras. Sometimes the Catuḥ-sana Kumāras went to Vaikuṇṭha to visit Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and once they were stopped from entering the palace at the seventh gate by two doorkeepers named Jaya and Vijaya. Due to their jealousy, Jaya and Vijaya would not allow the Kumāras entry, and consequently the Kumāras became angry and cursed Jaya and Vijaya, condemning them to take birth in a family of //asuras// in the material world. The omniscient Personality of Godhead could immediately understand the incident, and He came with His eternal consort the goddess of fortune. The Catuḥ-sana Kumāras immediately offered their obeisances unto the Lord. Simply by seeing the Lord and smelling the aroma of //tulasī// and saffron from His lotus feet, the Kumāras became devotees and abandoned their long-cherished impersonalism. Thus the four Kumāras were turned into Vaiṣṇavas simply by smelling the aromatic //tulasī// mixed with saffron. Those who are actually on the platform of Brahman realization and who have not offended the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa can immediately become Vaiṣṇavas simply by smelling the aroma of the Lord's lotus feet. However, those who are offenders or demons are never attracted to the Lord's personal feature, even though they may visit the Lord's temple many times. In Vṛndāvana we have seen many Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// who do not even come to the temple of Govindajī, Gopīnātha or Madana-mohana because they think that such temples are //māyā.// Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said that the Māyāvādīs are the greatest offenders.
