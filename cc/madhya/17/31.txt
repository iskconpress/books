===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the Supreme personality of Godhead playing the part of a very great advanced devotee. On the //mahā-bhāgavata// platform, the devotee makes no distinction between friends and enemies. On that platform he sees everyone as a servant of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā://

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śvapāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ

"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle //brāhmaṇa,// a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater [outcaste]." [[books:bg:5:18|(Bg. 5.18)]]

A //mahā-bhāgavata,// being learned and advanced in spiritual consciousness, sees no difference between a tiger, an elephant or a learned scholar. The test of advanced spiritual consciousness is that one becomes fearless. He envies no one, and he is always engaged in the Lord's service. He sees every living entity as an eternal part and parcel of the Lord, rendering service according to his capacity by the will of the Supreme Lord. As //Bhagavad-gītā// confirms:

> sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo
> mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca

"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]

The //mahā-bhāgavata// knows that Kṛṣṇa is in everyone's heart. Kṛṣṇa is dictating, and the living entity is following His dictations. Kṛṣṇa is within the heart of the tiger, elephant and boar. Therefore Kṛṣṇa tells them, "Here is a //mahā-bhāgavata.// Please do not disturb him." Why, then, should the animals be envious of such a great personality? Those who are neophytes or even a little progressed in devotional service should not try to imitate the //mahā-bhāgavata.// Rather, they should only follow in their footsteps. The word //anukara// means "imitating," and //anusara// means "trying to follow in the footsteps." We should not try to imitate the activities of a //mahā-bhāgavata// or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Our best efforts should be exerted in trying to follow them according to our ability. The //mahā-bhāgavata's// heart is completely freed from material contamination, and he can become very dear even to fierce animals like tigers and elephants. Indeed, the //mahā-bhāgavata// treats them as his very intimate friends. On this platform there is no question of envy. When the Lord was passing through the forest, He was in ecstasy, thinking the forest to be Vṛndāvana. He was simply searching for Kṛṣṇa.
