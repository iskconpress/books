Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary on this passage. A //sādhu// or an honest man is called a //mahājana// or a //mahātmā.// The //mahātmā// is thus described in //Bhagavad-gītā://

> mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha
> daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ
> bhajanty ananya-manaso
> jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam

"O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible." [[books:bg:9:13|(Bg. 9.13)]]

In the material world, the word //mahātmā// is understood in different ways by different religionists. Mundaners also come up with their different angles of vision. For the conditioned soul busy in sense gratification, a //mahājana// is recognized according to the proportion of sense gratification he offers. For instance, a businessman may consider a certain banker to be a //mahājana,// and //karmīs// desiring material enjoyment may consider philosophers like Jaimini to be //mahājanas.// There are many //yogīs// who want to control the senses, and for them Patañjali Rṣi is a //mahā-jana.// For the //jñānīs,// the atheist Kapila, Vaśiṣṭha, Durvāsā, Dattātreya and other impersonalist philosophers are //mahājanas.// For the demons, Hiraṇyākṣa, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa, Rāvaṇa's son Meghanāda, Jarāsandha and others are accepted as //mahājanas.// For materialistic anthropologists speculating on the evolution of the body, a person like Darwin is a //mahājana.// The scientists who are bewildered by Kṛṣṇa's external energy have no relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet they are accepted by some as //mahājanas.// Similarly, philosophers, historians, literary men, public speakers and social and political leaders are sometimes accepted as //mahājanas.// Such //mahājanas// are respected by certain men who have been described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:3:19|(2.3.19)]]:

> śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ
> saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ
> na yat-karṇa-pathopeto
> jātu nāma gadāgrajaḥ

"Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental pastimes of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the deliverer from evils."

Thus on the material platform animalistic leaders are worshiped by animals. Sometimes physicians, psychiatrists and social workers try to mitigate bodily pain, distress and fear, but they have no knowledge of spiritual identity and are bereft of a relationship with God. Yet they are considered //mahājanas// by the illusioned. Self-deceived persons sometimes accept leaders or spiritual masters from a priestly order that has been officially appointed by the codes of material life. In this way, they are deceived by official priests. Sometimes people accept as //mahā-janas// those who have been designated by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura as //ḍhaṅga-vipras// (imposter //brāhmaṇas).// Such imposters imitate the characteristics of Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and they envy Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who was certainly a //mahājana.// They make great artificial endeavors, advertising themselves as great devotees of the Lord or as mystic hypnotists knowledgeable in witchcraft, hypnotism and miracles. Sometimes people accept demons like Pūtanā, Tṛṇāvarta, Vatsa, Baka, Aghāsura and Dhenuka, Kālīya and Pralamba. Some people accept imitators and adversaries of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such as Pauṇḍraka, Śṛgāla Vāsudeva, the spiritual master of the demons (Śukrācārya), or atheists like Cārvāka, King Vena, Sugata and Arhat. Such people have no faith in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, they accept godless cheaters who present themselves as incarnations of God and cheat foolish people within the material world by word jugglery. Thus many rascals are accepted as //mahājanas.//

In this material world a person may be famous as a //karma-vīra,// a successful fruitive worker, or one may be very successful in performing religious duties, or he may be known as a hero in mental speculation (//jñāna-vīra),// or he may be a very famous renunciant. In any case, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:23:56|(3.23.56)]] gives the following opinion in this matter.

> neha yat karma dharmāya
> na virāgāya kalpate
> na tīrtha-pada-sevāyai
> jīvann api mṛto hi saḥ

"Anyone whose work is not meant to elevate him to religious life, anyone whose religious ritualistic performances do not raise him to renunciation, and anyone situated in renunciation that does not lead him to devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be considered dead, although he is breathing."

The conclusion is that all pious activity, fruitive activity, religious principles and renunciation must ultimately lead to devotional service. There are different types of processes for rendering service. One may serve his country, people, society, the //varṇāśrama-dharma,// the sick, the poor, the rich, women, demigods and so on. All this comes under the heading of sense gratification, or enjoyment in the material world. It is most unfortunate that people are more or less attracted by such material activity and that the leaders of these activities are accepted as //mahājanas,// great ideal leaders. Actually they are only misleaders, but an ordinary man cannot understand how he is being misled.

Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says: //sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya. A sādhu// is a great personality like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The //śāstras// are the injunctions of revealed scriptures. Those who are devoid of devotional service sometimes mistake those who have mundane motives for //mahājanas.// The only motive must be //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// devotional service to the Lord. Sometimes fruitive workers, dry philosophers, nondevotees, mystic //yogīs// and persons attached to material opulence, women and money are considered //mahājanas.// However, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:6:3:25|(6.3.25)]] gives the following statements about such unauthorized //mahājanas://

> prāyeṇa veda tad idaṁ na mahājano 'yaṁ
> devyā vimohita-matir bata māyayālam
> trayyāṁ jaḍī-kṛta-matir madhu-puṣpitāyāṁ
> vaitānike mahati karmaṇi yujyamānaḥ

In this material world, //karmīs// (fruitive actors) are accepted as //mahājanas// by foolish people who do not know the value of devotional service. Their mundane intelligence and mental speculative methods are under the control of the three modes of material nature. Consequently they cannot understand unalloyed devotional service. They are attracted by material activities, and they become worshipers of material nature. Thus they are known as fruitive actors. They even become entangled in material activities disguised as spiritual activities. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// such people are described as //veda-vāda-ratā.// They do not understand the real purpose of the //Vedas,// yet they think of themselves as Vedic authorities. People versed in Vedic knowledge must know Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]

A man covered by illusion cannot understand the proper way; therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: //dharma-sthāpana-hetu sādhura vyavahāra.// The behavior of a devotee is the criterion for all other behavior. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself followed the devotional principles and taught others to follow them. //Purī-gosāñira ye ācaraṇa, sei dharma sāra.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally followed the behavior of Mādhavendra Purī and advised others to follow his principles. Unfortunately, people have been attracted to the material body since time immemorial.

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tridhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ

"A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of birth worshipable, and who goes to the place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered like an ass or a cow." (//Bhāg.// 10.84.13) Those who accept the logic of //gaḍ-ḍalikā-pravāha// and follow in the footsteps of pseudo-//mahājanas// are carried away by the waves of //māyā.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura therefore warns:

> miche māyāra vaśe, yāccha bhese',
> khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi
> jīva kṛṣṇa-dāsa, e viśvāsa,
> ka'rle ta' āra duḥkha nāi

"Don't be carried away by the waves of //māyā.// Just surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and all miseries will end." Those who follow social customs and behavior forget to follow the path chalked out by the //mahājanas;// thus they are offenders at the feet of the //mahājanas.// Sometimes they consider such //mahājanas// very conservative, or they create their own //mahājanas.// In this way they ignore the principles of the //paramparā// system. This is a great misfortune for everyone. If one does not follow in the footsteps of a real //mahājana,// one's plans for happiness will be frustrated. This is elaborately explained in //Madhya-līlā// (Chapter Twenty-five, verses 55, 56 and 58). It is there stated:

> parama kāraṇa īśvare keha nāhi māne
> sva-sva-mata sthāpe para-matera khaṇḍane
>
> tāte chaya darśana haite 'tattva' nāhi jāni
> 'mahājana' yei kahe, sei 'satya' māni
>
> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-vāṇī---amṛtera dhāra
> tiṅho ye kahaye vastu, sei 'tattva'---sāra

People are so unfortunate that they do not accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead, they want to be supported by so-called //mahājanas,// authorities. //Tāte chaya darśana haite 'tattva' nāhi jāni:// we cannot ascertain the real truth simply by following speculators. We have to follow the footsteps of the //mahājanas// in the disciplic succession. Then our attempt will be successful. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-vāṇī-amṛtera dhāra:// "Whatever is spoken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an incessant flow of nectar." Whoever accepts His words as reality can understand the essence of the Absolute Truth. No one can ascertain the Absolute Truth by following the philosophy of Sāṅkhya or Patañjali, for the followers of Sāṅkhya or Patañjali do not accept Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum).// The ambition of such people is never fulfilled; therefore they are attracted by the external energy. Although mental speculators may be renowned all over the world as great authorities, actually they are not. Such leaders are themselves conservative and not at all liberal. However, if we preach this philosophy, people will consider Vaiṣṇavas very sectarian. Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was a real //mahājana,// but misguided people cannot distinguish the real from the unreal. However, a person who is awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness can understand the real religious path chalked out by the Lord and His pure devotees. Śrī Mādhavendra Purī was a real //mahājana// because he understood the Absolute Truth properly and throughout his life behaved like a pure devotee. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved the method of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī. Therefore, although from the material viewpoint the Sanoḍiyā //brāhmaṇa// was on a lower platform, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu considered him situated on the highest platform of spiritual realization.

Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (6.3.20) states that there are twelve //mahājanas:// Brahmā, Nārada, Śambhu, Kumāra, Kapila, Manu, Prahlāda, Janaka, Bhīṣma, Bali, Śukadeva and Yamarāja.

To select our //mahājanas// in the Gauḍīya-sampradāya, we have to follow in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His representatives. His next representative is Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, and the next are the six Gosvāmīs-Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Bhaṭṭa Raghunātha, Śrī Jīva, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa and Dāsa Raghunātha. The follower of Viṣṇusvāmī was Śrīdhara Svāmī, the most well known commentator on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He was also a //mahājana.// Similarly, Caṇḍīdāsa, Vidyāpati and Jayadeva were all //mahājanas.// One who tries to imitate the //mahājanas// just to become an imitative spiritual master is certainly far away from following in the footsteps of the //mahājanas.// Sometimes people cannot actually understand how a //mahājana// follows other //mahājanas.// In this way people are inclined to fall from devotional service.
