~~Title:Cc. Madhya 4: Śrī Mādhavendra Puri’s Devotional Service~~

====== Śrī Mādhavendra Puri’s Devotional Service ======

In his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of the Fourth Chapter. Passing along the path of Chatrabhoga and coming to Vṛddhamantreśvara, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reached the border of Orissa. On His way He enjoyed transcendental bliss by chanting and begging alms in different villages. In this way He reached the celebrated village of Remuṇā, where there is a Deity of Gopīnātha. There He narrated the story of Mādhavendra Purī, as He had heard it from His spiritual master, Īśvara Purī. The narration is as follows.

One night while in Govardhana, Mādhavendra Purī dreamed that the Gopāla Deity was within the forest. The next morning he invited his neighborhood friends to accompany him to excavate the Deity from the jungle. He then established the Deity of Śrī Gopālajī on top of Govardhana Hill with great pomp. Gopāla was worshiped, and the Annakūṭa festival was observed. This festival was known everywhere, and many people from the neighboring villages came to join. One night the Gopāla Deity again appeared to Mādhavendra Purī in a dream and asked him to go to Jagannātha Purī to collect some sandalwood pulp and smear it on the body of the Deity. Having received this order, Mādhavendra Purī immediately started for Orissa. Traveling through Bengal, he reached Remuṇā village and there received a pot of condensed milk (//kṣīra//) offered to the Deity of Gopīnāthajī. This pot of condensed milk was stolen by Gopīnātha and delivered to Mādhavendra Purī. Since then, the Gopīnātha Deity has been known as Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha, the Deity who stole the pot of condensed milk. After reaching Jagannātha Purī, Mādhavendra Purī received permission from the King to take out one //maṇa// of sandalwood and eight ounces of camphor. Aided by two men, he brought these things to Remuṇā. Again he saw in a dream that Gopāla at Govardhana Hill desired that very sandalwood to be turned into pulp mixed with camphor and smeared over the body of Gopīnāthajī. Understanding that that would satisfy the Gopāla Deity at Govardhana, Mādhavendra Purī executed the order and returned to Jagannātha Purī.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu narrated this story for Lord Nityānanda Prabhu and other devotees and praised the pure devotional service of Mādhavendra Purī. When He recited some verses composed by Mādhavendra Purī, He went into an ecstatic mood. But when He saw that many people were assembled, He checked Himself and ate some sweet rice //prasāda.// Thus He passed that night, and the next morning He again started for Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.4:1|Cc. Madhya 4.1]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto Mādhavendra Purī, who was given a pot of sweet rice stolen by Śrī Gopīnātha, celebrated thereafter as Kṣīra-corā. Being pleased by Mādhavendra Purī's love, Śrī Gopāla, the Deity at Govardhana, appeared to the public vision.

  ; [[.4:2|Cc. Madhya 4.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Prabhu! And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.4:3-4|Cc. Madhya 4.3-4]]
  : The Lord went to Jagannātha Purī and visited Lord Jagannātha's temple. He also met with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. All these pastimes have been very elaborately explained by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura in his book Caitanya-bhāgavata.

  ; [[.4:5|Cc. Madhya 4.5]]
  : By nature all the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are very wonderful and sweet, and when they are described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, they become like a shower of nectar.

  ; [[.4:6|Cc. Madhya 4.6]]
  : Therefore I very humbly submit that since these incidents have already been nicely described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, I would be very proud to repeat the same thing, and this would not be very good. I do not have such powers.

  ; [[.4:7|Cc. Madhya 4.7]]
  : I am therefore presenting only a synopsis of those events already described elaborately by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura in his Caitanya-maṅgala [now known as Caitanya-bhāgavata].

  ; [[.4:8|Cc. Madhya 4.8]]
  : Some of the incidents he did not describe elaborately but only summarized, and these I shall try to describe in this book.

  ; [[.4:9|Cc. Madhya 4.9]]
  : I thus offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. I hope that I will not offend his lotus feet by this action.

  ; [[.4:10|Cc. Madhya 4.10]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu proceeded toward Jagannātha Purī with four of His devotees, and He chanted the holy name of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, with great eagerness.

  ; [[.4:11|Cc. Madhya 4.11]]
  : Each day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally went to a village and collected a great quantity of rice and other grains for the preparation of prasāda.

  ; [[.4:12|Cc. Madhya 4.12]]
  : There were many rivers on the way, and at each river there was a tax collector. They did not hinder the Lord, however, and He showed them mercy. Finally He reached the village of Remuṇā.

  ; [[.4:13|Cc. Madhya 4.13]]
  : The Deity of Gopīnātha in the temple at Remuṇā was very attractive. Lord Caitanya visited the temple and offered His obeisances with great devotion.

  ; [[.4:14|Cc. Madhya 4.14]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered His obeisances at the lotus feet of the Gopīnātha Deity, the helmet of flowers on the head of Gopīnātha fell down and landed on the head of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.4:15|Cc. Madhya 4.15]]
  : When the Deity's helmet fell upon His head, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very pleased, and thus He chanted and danced in various ways with His devotees.

  ; [[.4:16|Cc. Madhya 4.16]]
  : All the servants of the Deity were struck with wonder due to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's intense love, His exquisite beauty and His transcendental qualities.

  ; [[.4:17|Cc. Madhya 4.17]]
  : Because of their love for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they served Him in many ways, and that night the Lord stayed at the temple of Gopīnātha.

  ; [[.4:18|Cc. Madhya 4.18]]
  : The Lord remained there because He was very eager to receive the remnants of sweet rice offered to the Gopīnātha Deity, having heard a narration from His spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, of what had once happened there.

  ; [[.4:19|Cc. Madhya 4.19]]
  : That Deity was known widely as Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu told His devotees the story of how the Deity became so famous.

  ; [[.4:20|Cc. Madhya 4.20]]
  : Formerly the Deity had stolen a pot of sweet rice for Mādhavendra Purī; therefore He became very famous as the Lord who stole the sweet rice.

  ; [[.4:21|Cc. Madhya 4.21]]
  : Once, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī traveled to Vṛndāvana, where he came upon the hill known as Govardhana.

  ; [[.4:22|Cc. Madhya 4.22]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī was almost mad in his ecstasy of love of Godhead, and he did not know whether it was day or night. Sometimes he stood up, and sometimes he fell to the ground. He could not discriminate whether he was in a proper place or not.

  ; [[.4:23|Cc. Madhya 4.23]]
  : After circumambulating the hill, Mādhavendra Purī went to Govinda-kuṇḍa and took his bath. He then sat beneath a tree to take his evening rest.

  ; [[.4:24|Cc. Madhya 4.24]]
  : While he was sitting beneath a tree, an unknown cowherd boy came with a pot of milk, placed it before Mādhavendra Purī and, smiling, addressed him as follows.

  ; [[.4:25|Cc. Madhya 4.25]]
  : "O Mādhavendra Purī, please drink the milk I have brought. Why don't you beg some food to eat? What kind of meditation are you undergoing?"

  ; [[.4:26|Cc. Madhya 4.26]]
  : When he saw the beauty of that boy, Mādhavendra Purī became very satisfied. Hearing His sweet words, he forgot all hunger and thirst.

  ; [[.4:27|Cc. Madhya 4.27]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī said, "Who are You ? Where do You reside? And how did You know that I was fasting?"

  ; [[.4:28|Cc. Madhya 4.28]]
  : The boy replied, "Sir, I am a cowherd boy, and I reside in this village. In My village, no one fasts.

  ; [[.4:29|Cc. Madhya 4.29]]
  : "In this village a person can beg food from others and thus eat. Some people drink only milk, but if a person does not ask anyone for food, I supply him all his eatables.

  ; [[.4:30|Cc. Madhya 4.30]]
  : "The women who come here to take water saw you, and they supplied Me with this milk and sent Me to you."

  ; [[.4:31|Cc. Madhya 4.31]]
  : The boy continued, "I must go very soon to milk the cows, but I shall return and take back this milk pot from you."

  ; [[.4:32|Cc. Madhya 4.32]]
  : Saying this, the boy left the place. Indeed, He suddenly could be seen no more, and Mādhavendra Purī's heart was filled with wonder.

  ; [[.4:33|Cc. Madhya 4.33]]
  : After drinking the milk, Mādhavendra Purī washed the pot and put it aside. He looked toward the path, but the boy never returned.

  ; [[.4:34|Cc. Madhya 4.34]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī could not sleep. He sat and chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, and at the end of the night he dozed a little, and his external activities stopped.

  ; [[.4:35|Cc. Madhya 4.35]]
  : In a dream Mādhavendra Purī saw the very same boy. The boy came before him and, holding his hand, took him to a bush in the jungle.

  ; [[.4:36|Cc. Madhya 4.36]]
  : The boy showed Mādhavendra Purī the bush and said, "I reside in this bush, and because of this I suffer very much from severe cold, rain showers, winds and scorching heat.

  ; [[.4:37|Cc. Madhya 4.37]]
  : "Please bring the people of the village and get them to take Me out of this bush. Then have them situate Me nicely on top of the hill.

  ; [[.4:38|Cc. Madhya 4.38]]
  : "Please construct a temple on top of that hill," the boy continued, "and install Me in that temple. After this, wash Me with large quantities of cold water so that My body may be cleansed.

  ; [[.4:39|Cc. Madhya 4.39]]
  : "For many days I have been observing you, and I have been wondering, 'When will Mādhavendra Purī come here to serve Me?'

  ; [[.4:40|Cc. Madhya 4.40]]
  : "I have accepted your service due to your ecstatic love for Me. Thus I shall appear, and by My audience all fallen souls will be delivered.

  ; [[.4:41|Cc. Madhya 4.41]]
  : "My name is Gopāla. I am the lifter of Govardhana Hill. I was installed by Vajra, and here I am the authority.

  ; [[.4:42|Cc. Madhya 4.42]]
  : "When the Muslims attacked, the priest who was serving Me hid Me in this bush in the jungle. Then he ran away out of fear of the attack.

  ; [[.4:43|Cc. Madhya 4.43]]
  : "Since the priest went away, I have been staying in this bush. It is very good that you have come here. Now just remove Me with care."

  ; [[.4:44|Cc. Madhya 4.44]]
  : After saying this, the boy disappeared. Then Mādhavendra Purī woke up and began to consider his dream.

  ; [[.4:45|Cc. Madhya 4.45]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī began to lament, "I saw Lord Kṛṣṇa directly, but I could not recognize Him!" Thus he fell down on the ground in ecstatic love.

  ; [[.4:46|Cc. Madhya 4.46]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī cried for some time, but then he fixed his mind on executing the order of Gopāla. Thus he became tranquil.

  ; [[.4:47|Cc. Madhya 4.47]]
  : After taking his morning bath, Mādhavendra Purī entered the village and assembled all the people. Then he spoke as follows.

  ; [[.4:48|Cc. Madhya 4.48]]
  : "The proprietor of this village, Govardhana-dhārī, is lying in the bushes. Let us go there and rescue Him from that place.

  ; [[.4:49|Cc. Madhya 4.49]]
  : "The bushes are very dense, and we will not be able to enter the jungle. Therefore take choppers and spades to clear the way."

  ; [[.4:50|Cc. Madhya 4.50]]
  : After hearing this, all the people accompanied Mādhavendra Purī with great pleasure. According to his directions, they cut down bushes, cleared a path and entered the jungle.

  ; [[.4:51|Cc. Madhya 4.51]]
  : When they saw the Deity covered with dirt and grass, they were all struck with wonder and pleasure.

  ; [[.4:52|Cc. Madhya 4.52]]
  : After they cleansed the body of the Deity, some of them said, "The Deity is very heavy. No one person can move Him."

  ; [[.4:53|Cc. Madhya 4.53]]
  : Since the Deity was very heavy, some of the stronger men assembled to carry Him to the top of the hill. Mādhavendra Purī also went there.

  ; [[.4:54|Cc. Madhya 4.54]]
  : A big stone was made into a throne, and the Deity was installed upon it. Another big stone was placed behind the Deity for support.

  ; [[.4:55|Cc. Madhya 4.55]]
  : All the brāhmaṇa priests of the village gathered together with nine waterpots, and water from Govinda-kuṇḍa lake was brought there and filtered.

  ; [[.4:56|Cc. Madhya 4.56]]
  : When the Deity was being installed, nine hundred pots of water were brought from Govinda-kuṇḍa. There were musical sounds of bugles and drums and the singing of women.

  ; [[.4:57|Cc. Madhya 4.57]]
  : During the festival at the installation ceremony, some people sang and some danced. All the milk, yogurt and clarified butter in the village was brought to the festival.

  ; [[.4:58|Cc. Madhya 4.58]]
  : Various foods and sweetmeats, as well as other kinds of presentations, were brought there. I am unable to describe all these.

  ; [[.4:59|Cc. Madhya 4.59]]
  : The villagers brought a large quantity of tulasī leaves, flowers, and various kinds of garments. Then Śrī Mādhavendra Purī personally began the abhiṣeka [bathing ceremony].

  ; [[.4:60|Cc. Madhya 4.60]]
  : After all inauspicious things were driven away by the chanting of the mantra, the Deity's bathing ceremony started. First the Deity was massaged with a large quantity of oil, so that His body became very glossy.

  ; [[.4:61|Cc. Madhya 4.61]]
  : After the first bathing, further bathings were conducted with pañca-gavya and then with pañcāmṛta. Then the mahā-snāna was performed with ghee and water, which had been brought in one hundred pots.

  ; [[.4:62|Cc. Madhya 4.62]]
  : After the mahā-snāna was finished, the Deity was again massaged with scented oil and His body made glossy. Then the last bathing ceremony was performed with scented water kept within a conchshell.

  ; [[.4:63|Cc. Madhya 4.63]]
  : After the body of the Deity was cleansed, He was dressed very nicely with new garments. Then sandalwood pulp, tulasī garlands and other fragrant flower garlands were placed upon the body of the Deity.

  ; [[.4:64|Cc. Madhya 4.64]]
  : After the bathing ceremony was finished, incense and lamps were burned and all kinds of food offered before the Deity. These foods included yogurt, milk and as many sweetmeats as were received.

  ; [[.4:65|Cc. Madhya 4.65]]
  : The Deity was first offered many varieties of food, then scented drinking water in new pots, and then water for washing the mouth. Finally pan mixed with a variety of spices was offered.

  ; [[.4:66|Cc. Madhya 4.66]]
  : After the last offering of tāmbūla and pan, bhoga-ārātrika was performed. Finally everyone offered various prayers and then obeisances, falling flat before the Deity in full surrender.

  ; [[.4:67|Cc. Madhya 4.67]]
  : As soon as the people of the village had understood that the Deity was going to be installed, they had brought their entire stocks of rice, dāl and wheat flour. They brought such large quantities that the entire surface of the top of the hill was filled.

  ; [[.4:68|Cc. Madhya 4.68]]
  : When the villagers brought their stock of rice, dāl and flour, the potters of the village brought all kinds of cooking pots, and in the morning the cooking began.

  ; [[.4:69|Cc. Madhya 4.69]]
  : Ten brāhmaṇas cooked the food grains, and five brāhmaṇas cooked both dry and liquid vegetables.

  ; [[.4:70|Cc. Madhya 4.70]]
  : The vegetable preparations were made from various kinds of spinach, roots and fruits collected from the forest, and someone had made baḍā and baḍi by mashing dāl. In this way the brāhmaṇas prepared all kinds of food.

  ; [[.4:71|Cc. Madhya 4.71]]
  : Five to seven men had prepared a huge quantity of chapatis, which were sufficiently covered with ghee [clarified butter], as were all the vegetables, rice and dāl.

  ; [[.4:72|Cc. Madhya 4.72]]
  : All the cooked rice was stacked on palāśa leaves, which were on new cloths spread over the ground.

  ; [[.4:73|Cc. Madhya 4.73]]
  : Around the stack of cooked rice were stacks of chapatis, and all the vegetables and liquid vegetable preparations were placed in different pots and put around them.

  ; [[.4:74|Cc. Madhya 4.74]]
  : Pots of yogurt, milk, buttermilk and śikhariṇī, sweet rice, cream and solid cream were placed alongside the vegetables.

  ; [[.4:75|Cc. Madhya 4.75]]
  : In this way the Annakūṭa ceremony was performed, and Mādhavendra Purī Gosvāmī personally offered everything to Gopāla.

  ; [[.4:76|Cc. Madhya 4.76]]
  : Many waterpots were filled with scented water for drinking, and Lord Śrī Gopāla, who had been hungry for many days, ate everything offered to Him.

  ; [[.4:77|Cc. Madhya 4.77]]
  : Although Śrī Gopāla ate everything offered, still, by the touch of His transcendental hand, everything remained as before.

  ; [[.4:78|Cc. Madhya 4.78]]
  : How Gopāla ate everything while the food remained the same was transcendentally perceived by Mādhavendra Purī Gosvāmī; nothing remains a secret to the devotees of the Lord.

  ; [[.4:79|Cc. Madhya 4.79]]
  : The wonderful festival and installation of Śrī Gopālajī was arranged in one day. Certainly all this was accomplished by the potency of Gopāla. No one but a devotee can understand this.

  ; [[.4:80|Cc. Madhya 4.80]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī offered water to Gopāla for washing His mouth, and he gave Him betel nuts to chew. Then, while ārati was performed, all the people chanted, "Jaya, Jaya!" ["All glories to Gopāla!"].

  ; [[.4:81|Cc. Madhya 4.81]]
  : Arranging for the Lord's rest, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī brought a new cot, and over this he spread a new bedspread and thus made the bed ready.

  ; [[.4:82|Cc. Madhya 4.82]]
  : A temporary temple was constructed by covering the bed all around with a straw mattress. Thus there was a bed and a straw mattress to cover it.

  ; [[.4:83|Cc. Madhya 4.83]]
  : After the Lord was laid down to rest on the bed, Mādhavendra Purī gathered all the brāhmaṇas who had prepared the prasāda and said to them, "Now feed everyone sumptuously, from the children on up to the aged!"

  ; [[.4:84|Cc. Madhya 4.84]]
  : All the people gathered there sat down to honor the prasāda, and by and by they took food. All the brāhmaṇas and their wives were fed first.

  ; [[.4:85|Cc. Madhya 4.85]]
  : Not only did the people of Govardhana village take prasāda, but also those who came from other villages. They also saw the Deity of Gopāla and were offered prasāda to eat.

  ; [[.4:86|Cc. Madhya 4.86]]
  : Seeing the influence of Mādhavendra Purī, all the people gathered there were struck with wonder. They saw that the Annakūṭa ceremony, which had been performed before during the time of Kṛṣṇa, was now taking place again by the mercy of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:87|Cc. Madhya 4.87]]
  : All the brāhmaṇas present on that occasion were initiated by Mādhavendra Purī into the Vaiṣṇava cult, and Mādhavendra Purī engaged them in different types of service.

  ; [[.4:88|Cc. Madhya 4.88]]
  : After taking rest, the Deity must be awakened at the end of the day, and immediately some food and some water must be offered to Him.

  ; [[.4:89|Cc. Madhya 4.89]]
  : When it was advertised throughout the country that Lord Gopāla had appeared atop Govardhana Hill, all the people from neighboring villages came to see the Deity.

  ; [[.4:90|Cc. Madhya 4.90]]
  : One village after another was pleased to beg Mādhavendra Purī to allot them one day to perform the Annakūṭa ceremony. Thus, day after day, the Annakūṭa ceremony was performed for some time.

  ; [[.4:91|Cc. Madhya 4.91]]
  : Śrī Mādhavendra Purī did not eat anything throughout the day, but at night, after laying the Deity down to rest, he took a milk preparation.

  ; [[.4:92|Cc. Madhya 4.92]]
  : The next morning, the rendering of service to the Deity began again, and people from one village arrived with all kinds of food grains.

  ; [[.4:93|Cc. Madhya 4.93]]
  : The inhabitants of the village brought to the Deity of Gopāla as much food grains, ghee, yogurt and milk as they had in their village.

  ; [[.4:94|Cc. Madhya 4.94]]
  : The next day, almost like before, there was an Annakūṭa ceremony. All the brāhmaṇas prepared foods and Gopāla accepted them.

  ; [[.4:95|Cc. Madhya 4.95]]
  : The ideal place to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness is Vrajabhūmi, or Vṛndāvana, where the people are naturally inclined to love Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa is naturally inclined to love them.

  ; [[.4:96|Cc. Madhya 4.96]]
  : Throngs of people came from different villages to see the Deity of Gopāla, and they took mahā-prasāda sumptuously. When they saw the superexcellent form of Lord Gopāla, all their lamentation and unhappiness disappeared.

  ; [[.4:97|Cc. Madhya 4.97]]
  : All the villages in neighboring Vrajabhūmi [Vṛndāvana] became aware of the appearance of Gopāla, and all the people from these villages came to see Him. Day after day they all performed the Annakūṭa ceremony.

  ; [[.4:98|Cc. Madhya 4.98]]
  : In this way not only the neighboring villages but all the other provinces came to know of Gopāla's appearance. Thus people came from all over, bringing a variety of presentations.

  ; [[.4:99|Cc. Madhya 4.99]]
  : The people of Mathurā, who are very big capitalists, also brought various presentations and offered them before the Deity in devotional service.

  ; [[.4:100|Cc. Madhya 4.100]]
  : Thus countless presentations of gold, silver, garments, scented articles and eatables arrived. The store of Gopāla increased daily.

  ; [[.4:101|Cc. Madhya 4.101]]
  : One very rich kṣatriya of the royal order constructed a temple, someone made cooking utensils, and someone constructed boundary walls.

  ; [[.4:102|Cc. Madhya 4.102]]
  : Each and every family residing in the land of Vrajabhūmi contributed one cow. In this way, thousands of cows became the property of Gopāla.

  ; [[.4:103|Cc. Madhya 4.103]]
  : Eventually two brāhmaṇas in the renounced order arrived from Bengal, and Mādhavendra Purī, who liked them very much, kept them in Vṛndāvana and gave them all kinds of comforts.

  ; [[.4:104|Cc. Madhya 4.104]]
  : These two were then initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, and he entrusted them with the daily service of the Lord. This service was performed continuously, and the worship of the Deity became very gorgeous. Thus Mādhavendra Purī was very pleased.

  ; [[.4:105|Cc. Madhya 4.105]]
  : In this way the Deity worship in the temple was very gorgeously performed for two years. Then one day Mādhavendra Purī had a dream.

  ; [[.4:106|Cc. Madhya 4.106]]
  : In his dream, Mādhavendra Purī saw Gopāla, who said, "My bodily temperature still has not decreased. Please bring sandalwood from the Malaya province and smear the pulp over My body to cool Me.

  ; [[.4:107|Cc. Madhya 4.107]]
  : "Bring sandalwood pulp from Jagannātha Purī. Kindly go quickly. Since no one else can do it, you must."

  ; [[.4:108|Cc. Madhya 4.108]]
  : After having this dream, Mādhavendra Purī Gosvāmī became very glad due to ecstasy of love of Godhead, and in order to execute the command of the Lord, he started east toward Bengal.

  ; [[.4:109|Cc. Madhya 4.109]]
  : Before leaving, Mādhavendra Purī made all arrangements for regular Deity worship, and he engaged different people in various duties. Then, taking up the order of Gopāla, he started for Bengal.

  ; [[.4:110|Cc. Madhya 4.110]]
  : When Mādhavendra Purī arrived at the house of Advaita Ācārya in Śāntipura, the Ācārya became very pleased upon seeing the ecstatic love of Godhead manifest in Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:111|Cc. Madhya 4.111]]
  : Advaita Ācārya begged to be initiated by Mādhavendra Purī. After initiating Him, Mādhavendra Purī started for South India.

  ; [[.4:112|Cc. Madhya 4.112]]
  : Going into South India, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī visited Remuṇā, where Gopīnātha is situated. Upon seeing the beauty of the Deity, Mādhavendra Purī was overwhelmed.

  ; [[.4:113|Cc. Madhya 4.113]]
  : In the corridor of the temple, from which people generally viewed the Deity, Mādhavendra Purī chanted and danced. Then he sat down there and asked a brāhmaṇa what kinds of foods they offered to the Deity.

  ; [[.4:114|Cc. Madhya 4.114]]
  : From the excellence of the arrangements, Mādhavendra Purī understood by deduction that only the best food was offered.

  ; [[.4:115|Cc. Madhya 4.115]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī thought, "I shall inquire from the priest what foods are offered to Gopīnātha so that by making arrangements in our kitchen, we can offer similar foods to Śrī Gopāla."

  ; [[.4:116|Cc. Madhya 4.116]]
  : When the brāhmaṇa priest was questioned about this matter, he explained in detail what kinds of food were offered to the Deity of Gopīnātha.

  ; [[.4:117|Cc. Madhya 4.117]]
  : The brāhmaṇa priest said, "In the evening the Deity is offered sweet rice in twelve earthen pots. Because the taste is as good as nectar [amṛta], it is named amṛta-keli.

  ; [[.4:118|Cc. Madhya 4.118]]
  : "This sweet rice is celebrated throughout the world as gopīnātha-kṣīra. It is not offered anywhere else in the world."

  ; [[.4:119|Cc. Madhya 4.119]]
  : While Mādhavendra Purī was talking with the brāhmaṇa priest, the sweet rice was placed before the Deity as an offering. Hearing this, Mādhavendra Purī thought as follows.

  ; [[.4:120|Cc. Madhya 4.120]]
  : "If, without my asking, a little sweet rice is given to me, I can then taste it and make a similar preparation to offer my Lord Gopāla."

  ; [[.4:121|Cc. Madhya 4.121]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī became greatly ashamed when he desired to taste the sweet rice, and he immediately began to think of Lord Viṣṇu. While he was thus thinking of Lord Viṣṇu, the offering was completed, and the ārati ceremony began.

  ; [[.4:122|Cc. Madhya 4.122]]
  : After the ārati was finished, Mādhavendra Purī offered his obeisances to the Deity and then left the temple. He did not say anything more to anyone.

  ; [[.4:123|Cc. Madhya 4.123]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī avoided begging. He was completely unattached and indifferent to material things. If, without his begging, someone offered him some food, he would eat; otherwise he would fast.

  ; [[.4:124|Cc. Madhya 4.124]]
  : A paramahaṁsa like Mādhavendra Purī is always satisfied in the loving service of the Lord. Material hunger and thirst cannot impede his activities. When he desired to taste a little sweet rice offered to the Deity, he considered that he had committed an offense by desiring to eat what was being offered to the Deity.

  ; [[.4:125|Cc. Madhya 4.125]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī left the temple and sat down in the village marketplace, which was vacant. Sitting there, he began to chant. In the meantime, the temple priest laid the Deity down to rest.

  ; [[.4:126|Cc. Madhya 4.126]]
  : Finishing his daily duties, the priest went to take rest. In a dream he saw the Gopīnātha Deity come to talk to him, and He spoke as follows.

  ; [[.4:127|Cc. Madhya 4.127]]
  : "O priest, please get up and open the door of the temple. I have kept one pot of sweet rice for the sannyāsī Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:128|Cc. Madhya 4.128]]
  : "This pot of sweet rice is just behind My cloth curtain. You did not see it because of My tricks.

  ; [[.4:129|Cc. Madhya 4.129]]
  : "A sannyāsī named Mādhavendra Purī is sitting in the vacant marketplace. Please take this pot of sweet rice from behind Me and deliver it to him."

  ; [[.4:130|Cc. Madhya 4.130]]
  : Awaking from the dream, the priest immediately rose from bed and thought it wise to take a bath before entering the Deity's room. He then opened the temple door.

  ; [[.4:131|Cc. Madhya 4.131]]
  : According to the Deity's directions, the priest found the pot of sweet rice behind the cloth curtain. He removed the pot and mopped up the place where it had been kept. He then went out of the temple.

  ; [[.4:132|Cc. Madhya 4.132]]
  : Closing the door of the temple, he went to the village with the pot of sweet rice. He called out in every stall in search of Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:133|Cc. Madhya 4.133]]
  : Holding the pot of sweet rice, the priest called, "Will he whose name is Mādhavendra Purī please come and take this pot! Gopīnātha has stolen this pot of sweet rice for you!"

  ; [[.4:134|Cc. Madhya 4.134]]
  : The priest continued, "Would the sannyāsī whose name is Mādhavendra Purī please come and take this pot of sweet rice and enjoy the prasāda with great happiness! You are the most fortunate person within these three worlds!"

  ; [[.4:135|Cc. Madhya 4.135]]
  : Hearing this invitation, Mādhavendra Purī came out and identified himself. The priest then delivered the pot of sweet rice and offered his obeisances, falling flat before him.

  ; [[.4:136|Cc. Madhya 4.136]]
  : When the story about the pot of sweet rice was explained to him in detail, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī at once became absorbed in ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.4:137|Cc. Madhya 4.137]]
  : Upon seeing the ecstatic loving symptoms manifest in Mādhavendra Purī, the priest was struck with wonder. He could understand why Kṛṣṇa had become so much obliged to him, and he saw that Kṛṣṇa's action was befitting.

  ; [[.4:138|Cc. Madhya 4.138]]
  : The priest offered his obeisances to Mādhavendra Purī and returned to the temple. Then, in ecstasy, Mādhavendra Purī ate the sweet rice offered to him by Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.4:139|Cc. Madhya 4.139]]
  : After this, Mādhavendra Purī washed the pot and broke it into pieces. He then bound all the pieces in his outer cloth and kept them nicely.

  ; [[.4:140|Cc. Madhya 4.140]]
  : Each day, Mādhavendra Purī would eat one piece of that earthen pot, and after eating it he would immediately be overwhelmed with ecstasy. These are wonderful stories.

  ; [[.4:141|Cc. Madhya 4.141]]
  : Having broken the pot and bound the pieces in his cloth, Mādhavendra Purī began to think, "The Lord has given me a pot of sweet rice, and when the people hear of this tomorrow morning, there will be great crowds."

  ; [[.4:142|Cc. Madhya 4.142]]
  : Thinking this, Śrī Mādhavendra Purī offered his obeisances to Gopīnātha on the spot and left Remuṇā before morning.

  ; [[.4:143|Cc. Madhya 4.143]]
  : Walking and walking, Mādhavendra Purī finally reached Jagannātha Purī, which is also known as Nīlācala. There he saw Lord Jagannātha and was overwhelmed with loving ecstasy.

  ; [[.4:144|Cc. Madhya 4.144]]
  : When Mādhavendra Purī was overwhelmed in the ecstasy of love of Godhead, he sometimes stood up and sometimes fell to the ground. Sometimes he laughed, danced and sang. In this way he enjoyed transcendental bliss by seeing the Jagannātha Deity.

  ; [[.4:145|Cc. Madhya 4.145]]
  : When Mādhavendra Purī came to Jagannātha Purī, people were aware of his transcendental reputation. Therefore crowds of people came and offered him all sorts of respect in devotion.

  ; [[.4:146|Cc. Madhya 4.146]]
  : Even though one may not like it, reputation, as ordained by providence, comes to him. Indeed, one's transcendental reputation is known throughout the entire world.

  ; [[.4:147|Cc. Madhya 4.147]]
  : Being afraid of his reputation [pratiṣṭhā], Mādhavendra Purī fled from Remuṇā. But the reputation brought by love of Godhead is so sublime that it goes along with the devotee, as if following him.

  ; [[.4:148|Cc. Madhya 4.148]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī wanted to leave Jagannātha Purī because the people were honoring him as a great devotee; however, this threatened to hinder his collecting sandalwood for the Gopāla Deity.

  ; [[.4:149|Cc. Madhya 4.149]]
  : Śrī Mādhavendra Purī told all the servants of Lord Jagannātha and all the great devotees there the story of the appearance of Śrī Gopāla.

  ; [[.4:150|Cc. Madhya 4.150]]
  : When all the devotees at Jagannātha Purī heard that the Gopāla Deity wanted sandalwood, in great pleasure they all endeavored to collect it.

  ; [[.4:151|Cc. Madhya 4.151]]
  : Those who were acquainted with government officers met with them and begged for camphor and sandalwood, which they collected.

  ; [[.4:152|Cc. Madhya 4.152]]
  : One brāhmaṇa and one servant were given to Mādhavendra Purī just to carry the sandalwood. He was also given the necessary traveling expenses.

  ; [[.4:153|Cc. Madhya 4.153]]
  : To get past the toll collectors along the way, Mādhavendra Purī was supplied with the necessary release papers from government officers. The papers were placed in his hand.

  ; [[.4:154|Cc. Madhya 4.154]]
  : In this way Mādhavendra Purī started for Vṛndāvana with the burden of sandalwood, and after some days he again reached the village of Remuṇā and the Gopīnātha temple there.

  ; [[.4:155|Cc. Madhya 4.155]]
  : When Mādhavendra Purī reached the temple of Gopīnātha, he offered his respectful obeisances many times at the lotus feet of the Lord. In the ecstasy of love, he began to dance and sing without cessation.

  ; [[.4:156|Cc. Madhya 4.156]]
  : When the priest of Gopīnātha saw Mādhavendra Purī again, he offered all respects to him and, giving him the sweet rice prasāda, made him eat.

  ; [[.4:157|Cc. Madhya 4.157]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī took rest that night in the temple, but toward the end of the night he had another dream.

  ; [[.4:158|Cc. Madhya 4.158]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī dreamed that Gopāla came before him and said, "O Mādhavendra Purī, I have already received all the sandalwood and camphor.

  ; [[.4:159|Cc. Madhya 4.159]]
  : "Now just grind all the sandalwood together with the camphor and then smear the pulp on the body of Gopīnātha daily until it is finished.

  ; [[.4:160|Cc. Madhya 4.160]]
  : "There is no difference between My body and Gopīnātha's body. They are one and the same. Therefore if you smear the sandalwood pulp on the body of Gopīnātha, you will naturally also smear it on My body. Thus the temperature of My body will be reduced.

  ; [[.4:161|Cc. Madhya 4.161]]
  : "You should not hesitate to act according to My order. Believing in Me, just do what is needed."

  ; [[.4:162|Cc. Madhya 4.162]]
  : After giving these instructions, Gopāla disappeared, and Mādhavendra Purī awoke. He immediately called for all the servants of Gopīnātha, and they came before him.

  ; [[.4:163|Cc. Madhya 4.163]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī said, "Smear the body of Gopīnātha with this camphor and sandalwood I have brought for Gopāla in Vṛndāvana. Do this regularly every day.

  ; [[.4:164|Cc. Madhya 4.164]]
  : "If the sandalwood pulp is smeared over the body of Gopīnātha, then Gopāla will be cooled. After all, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely independent; His order is all-powerful."

  ; [[.4:165|Cc. Madhya 4.165]]
  : The servants of Gopīnātha became very pleased to hear that in the summer all the sandalwood pulp would be used to anoint the body of Gopīnātha.

  ; [[.4:166|Cc. Madhya 4.166]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī said, "These two assistants will regularly grind the sandalwood, and you should also get two other people to help. I shall pay their salary."

  ; [[.4:167|Cc. Madhya 4.167]]
  : In this way Gopīnāthajī was supplied ground sandalwood pulp daily. The servants of Gopīnātha were very pleased with this.

  ; [[.4:168|Cc. Madhya 4.168]]
  : In this way the sandalwood pulp was smeared over the body of Gopīnātha until the whole stock was finished. Mādhavendra Purī stayed there until that time.

  ; [[.4:169|Cc. Madhya 4.169]]
  : At the end of summer Mādhavendra Purī returned to Jagannātha Purī, where he remained with great pleasure during the whole period of Cāturmāsya.

  ; [[.4:170|Cc. Madhya 4.170]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally praised the nectarean characteristics of Mādhavendra Purī, and while He related all this to the devotees, He personally relished it.

  ; [[.4:171|Cc. Madhya 4.171]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Nityānanda Prabhu to judge whether there was anyone within the world as fortunate as Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:172|Cc. Madhya 4.172]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Mādhavendra Purī was so fortunate that Kṛṣṇa personally appeared before him on the plea of delivering milk. Three times the Lord gave orders to Mādhavendra Purī in dreams.

  ; [[.4:173|Cc. Madhya 4.173]]
  : "Being obliged because of the loving affairs of Mādhavendra Purī, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared as the Gopāla Deity, and, accepting his service, He liberated the whole world.

  ; [[.4:174|Cc. Madhya 4.174]]
  : "On account of Mādhavendra Purī, Lord Gopīnātha stole the pot of sweet rice. Thus He became famous as Kṣīra-corā [the thief who stole the sweet rice].

  ; [[.4:175|Cc. Madhya 4.175]]
  : "Mādhavendra Purī smeared the sandalwood pulp over the body of Gopīnātha, and in this way he was overpowered with love of Godhead.

  ; [[.4:176|Cc. Madhya 4.176]]
  : "In the provinces of India governed by the Muslims, there was much inconvenience in traveling with sandalwood and camphor. Because of this, Mādhavendra Purī might have gotten into trouble. This became known to the Gopāla Deity.

  ; [[.4:177|Cc. Madhya 4.177]]
  : "The Lord is very merciful and attached to His devotees, so when Gopīnātha was covered with sandalwood pulp, Mādhavendra Purī's labor became successful."

  ; [[.4:178|Cc. Madhya 4.178]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu placed the standard of Mādhavendra Purī's intense love before Nityānanda Prabhu for judgment. "All his loving activities are uncommon," Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. "Indeed, one is struck with wonder to hear of his activities."

  ; [[.4:179|Cc. Madhya 4.179]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "Śrī Mādhavendra Purī used to remain alone. He was completely renounced and always very silent. He was uninterested in everything material, and for fear of talking about mundane things, he always lived without a companion.

  ; [[.4:180|Cc. Madhya 4.180]]
  : "After receiving the transcendental orders of Gopāla, this great personality traveled thousands of miles just to collect sandalwood by begging.

  ; [[.4:181|Cc. Madhya 4.181]]
  : "Although Mādhavendra Purī was hungry, he would not beg food to eat. This renounced person carried a load of sandalwood for the sake of Śrī Gopāla.

  ; [[.4:182|Cc. Madhya 4.182]]
  : "Without considering his personal comforts, Mādhavendra Purī carried one māna [about eighty-two pounds] of sandalwood and twenty tolās [about eight ounces] of camphor to smear over the body of Gopāla. This transcendental pleasure was sufficient for him.

  ; [[.4:183|Cc. Madhya 4.183]]
  : "Since there were restrictions against taking the sandalwood out of the Orissa province, the toll official confiscated the stock, but Mādhavendra Purī showed him the release papers given by the government and consequently escaped difficulties.

  ; [[.4:184|Cc. Madhya 4.184]]
  : "Mādhavendra Purī was not at all anxious during the long journey to Vṛndāvana through the provinces governed by the Muslims and filled with unlimited numbers of watchmen.

  ; [[.4:185|Cc. Madhya 4.185]]
  : "Although Mādhavendra Purī did not have a farthing with him, he was not afraid to pass by the toll officers. His only enjoyment was in carrying the load of sandalwood to Vṛndāvana for Gopāla.

  ; [[.4:186|Cc. Madhya 4.186]]
  : "This is the natural result of intense love of Godhead. The devotee does not consider personal inconveniences or impediments. In all circumstances he wants to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.4:187|Cc. Madhya 4.187]]
  : "Śrī Gopāla wanted to show how intensely Mādhavendra Purī loved Kṛṣṇa; therefore He asked him to go to Nīlācala to fetch sandalwood and camphor.

  ; [[.4:188|Cc. Madhya 4.188]]
  : "With great trouble and after much labor, Mādhavendra Purī brought the load of sandalwood to Remuṇā. However, he was still very pleased; he discounted all the difficulties.

  ; [[.4:189|Cc. Madhya 4.189]]
  : "To test the intense love of Mādhavendra Purī, Gopāla, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ordered him to bring sandalwood from Nīlācala, and when Mādhavendra Purī passed this examination, the Lord became very merciful to him.

  ; [[.4:190|Cc. Madhya 4.190]]
  : "Such behavior exhibited in loving service between the devotee and the devotee's lovable object, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is transcendental. It is not possible for a common man to understand. Common men do not even have the capacity."

  ; [[.4:191|Cc. Madhya 4.191]]
  : After saying this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu read the famous verse of Mādhavendra Purī. That verse is just like the moon. It has spread illumination all over the world.

  ; [[.4:192|Cc. Madhya 4.192]]
  : Continuous rubbing increases the aroma of Malaya sandalwood. Similarly, consideration of this verse increases one's understanding of its importance.

  ; [[.4:193|Cc. Madhya 4.193]]
  : As the Kaustubha-maṇi is considered the most precious of valuable stones, this verse is similarly considered the best of poems dealing with the mellows of devotional service.

  ; [[.4:194|Cc. Madhya 4.194]]
  : Actually this verse was spoken by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī Herself, and by Her mercy only was it manifest in the words of Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:195|Cc. Madhya 4.195]]
  : Only Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has tasted the poetry of this verse. No fourth man is capable of understanding it.

  ; [[.4:196|Cc. Madhya 4.196]]
  : Mādhavendra Purī recited this verse again and again at the end of his material existence. Thus uttering this verse, he attained the ultimate goal of life.

  ; [[.4:197|Cc. Madhya 4.197]]
  : "O My Lord! O most merciful master! O master of Mathurā! When shall I see You again? Because of My not seeing You, My agitated heart has become unsteady. O most beloved one, what shall I do now?"

  ; [[.4:198|Cc. Madhya 4.198]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recited this verse, He immediately fell to the ground unconscious. He was overwhelmed and had no control over Himself.

  ; [[.4:199|Cc. Madhya 4.199]]
  : When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell to the ground in ecstatic love, Lord Nityānanda quickly took Him on His lap. Crying, Caitanya Mahāprabhu then got up again.

  ; [[.4:200|Cc. Madhya 4.200]]
  : Exhibiting ecstatic emotions, the Lord began to run here and there, making resounding noises. Sometimes He laughed, and sometimes He cried, and sometimes He danced and sang.

  ; [[.4:201|Cc. Madhya 4.201]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu could not recite the whole verse. He simply said, "Ayi dīna, ayi dīna," repeatedly. Thus He could not speak, and profuse tears were in His eyes.

  ; [[.4:202|Cc. Madhya 4.202]]
  : Trembling, perspiration, jubilant tears, shock, fading of the bodily luster, disappointment, moroseness, loss of memory, pride, joy and humility were all visible in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's body.

  ; [[.4:203|Cc. Madhya 4.203]]
  : This verse uncovered the door of ecstatic love, and when it was exhibited, all the servants of Gopīnātha saw Caitanya Mahāprabhu dance in ecstasy.

  ; [[.4:204|Cc. Madhya 4.204]]
  : When many people crowded around Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He regained His external senses. In the meantime, the offering to the Deity had been finished, and there was a resounding ārati performance.

  ; [[.4:205|Cc. Madhya 4.205]]
  : When the Deities were laid down to rest, the priest came out of the temple and offered all twelve pots of sweet rice to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.4:206|Cc. Madhya 4.206]]
  : When all the pots of sweet rice, remnants left by Gopīnātha, were placed before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He became very pleased. In order to feed the devotees, He accepted five of them.

  ; [[.4:207|Cc. Madhya 4.207]]
  : The seven remaining pots were pushed forward and delivered to the priest. Then the five pots of sweet rice the Lord had accepted were distributed among the five devotees, and they ate the prasāda.

  ; [[.4:208|Cc. Madhya 4.208]]
  : Being identical with the Gopīnātha Deity, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had already tasted and eaten the pots of sweet rice. Yet just to manifest devotional service, He again ate the pots of sweet rice as a devotee.

  ; [[.4:209|Cc. Madhya 4.209]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed that night at the temple engaged in congregational chanting. In the morning, after seeing the maṅgala-ārati performance, He departed.

  ; [[.4:210|Cc. Madhya 4.210]]
  : In this way, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally tasted with His own mouth the transcendental qualities of Gopālajī, Gopīnātha and Śrī Mādhavendra Purī.

  ; [[.4:211|Cc. Madhya 4.211]]
  : Thus I have described both the transcendental glories of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's affection for His devotees and the highest limit of ecstatic love of God.

  ; [[.4:212|Cc. Madhya 4.212]]
  : One who hears this narration with faith and devotion attains the treasure of love of Godhead at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.4:213|Cc. Madhya 4.213]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
