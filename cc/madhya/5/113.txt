**After the marriage ceremony was performed, the Lord informed both brāhmaṇas, "You two brāhmaṇas are My eternal servants, birth after birth."**

===== Purport =====

Like these two //brāhmaṇas// of Vidyānagara, there are many devotees who are eternal servants of the Lord. They are specifically known as //nitya-siddha,// eternally perfect. Although the //nitya-siddhas// appear in the material world and seem to be common members of the world, they never forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition. This is the symptom of a //nitya-siddha.//

There are two kinds of living entities-//nitya-siddha// and //nitya-baddha.// The //nitya-siddha// never forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality, whereas the //nitya-baddha// is always conditioned, even before the creation. He always forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the Lord informs the two //brāhmaṇas// that they are His servants birth after birth. The phrase birth after birth refers to the material world because in the spiritual world there is no birth, death, old age or disease. By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the //nitya-siddha// remains within this material world like an ordinary man, but the only business of the //nitya-siddha// is to broadcast the glories of the Lord. This incident appears to be an ordinary story about a marriage transaction involving two ordinary people. However, Kṛṣṇa accepted the two //brāhmaṇas// as His eternal servants. Both //brāhmaṇas// took much trouble in these negotiations, just like mundane people, yet they were acting as eternal servants of the Lord. All //nitya-siddhas// within this material world may appear to toil like ordinary men, but they never forget their position as servants of the Lord.

Another point: The elderly //brāhmaṇa// belonged to an aristocratic family and was learned and wealthy. The young //brāhmaṇa// belonged to an ordinary family and was uneducated. But these mundane qualifications do not concern a //nitya-siddha// engaged in the service of the Lord. We have to accept the fact that the //nitya-siddhas// are completely distinct from the //nitya-baddhas,// who are ordinary human beings. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms this statement:

> gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe,    nitya-siddha kari' māne,
> se yāya vrajendra-suta-pāśa
> śrī-gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, yebā jāne cintāmaṇi,
> tāra haya vraja-bhūme vāsa

One who accepts the associates of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as //nitya-siddhas// is certain to be elevated to the spiritual kingdom to become an associate of the Supreme Lord. One should also know that Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi---those places in Bengal where Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed-are equal to Vrajabhūmi, or Vṛndāvana. There is no difference between the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana and those of Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, or Śrīdhāma Māyāpura.
