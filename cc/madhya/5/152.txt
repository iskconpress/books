===== Purport =====

Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu considered Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of //sannyāsa// to be useless. He therefore relieved the Lord of the trouble of carrying the staff. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu expressed anger because He wanted to teach all other //sannyāsīs// that they should not give up the staff before attaining the platform of //paramahaṁsa.// Seeing that the regulative principles could be slackened by such action, Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to carry the staff personally. However, Nityānanda broke it. For this reason Caitanya Mahāprabhu displayed a little anger. It is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:21|(Bg. 3.21)]], //yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ:// Whatever great people do, others follow. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to follow the Vedic principles strictly in order to save inexperienced neophytes who try to imitate //paramahaṁsas.//
