===== Purport =====

As the Supersoul within the heart of all living entities, Kṛṣṇa knows everyone's desire, everyone's request and everyone's prayer. Although all these may be contradictory, the Lord has to create a situation in which everyone will be pleased. This is an instance of a marriage negotiation between an elderly //brāhmaṇa// and a youthful one. The elderly //brāhmaṇa// was certainly willing to give his daughter in charity to the young //brāhmaṇa,// but his son and relatives became impediments to this transaction. The elderly //brāhmaṇa// considered how to get out of this situation and still offer his daughter to the young //brāhmaṇa.// His son, an atheist and a very cunning fellow, was thinking of how to stop the marriage. The father and son were thinking in a contradictory way, yet Kṛṣṇa created a situation wherein they both agreed. They both agreed that if the Gopāla Deity would come and serve as a witness, the daughter would be given to the young //brāhmaṇa.//
