It was not at all the intention of the young //brāhmaṇa// to get the daughter of the elderly //brāhmaṇa// in marriage and thus enjoy material happiness and sense gratification. It was not for that reason that the young //brāhmaṇa// went to Vṛndāvana to ask the Supreme Personality of Godhead to act as a witness. His only concern was that the elderly //brāhmaṇa// had promised something, and if Gopāla did not bear witness to that transaction, then the older //brāhmaṇa// would incur a spiritual blemish. Therefore, the young //brāhmaṇa// wanted protection and help from the Deity. The young //brāhmaṇa// was thus a pure Vaiṣṇava, and he had no desire for sense gratification. He wanted only to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the older //brāhmaṇa,// who was also a Vaiṣṇava and very devoted to the Lord.
