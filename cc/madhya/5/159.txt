===== Purport =====

There are four points of instruction one should consider in the story of Sākṣi-gopāla. First, the Deity (//arcā-vigraha//) of Śrī Gopāla is eternally //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,// the transcendental form of the Lord. Second, the Deity surpasses material regulative principles and extends the reality of transcendental principles. Third, one can be situated in a transcendental position after becoming a //brāhmaṇa,// but as a //brāhmaṇa,// one has to follow the regulative principles very strictly. Lastly, //brahmaṇya-deva// indicates Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, who is worshiped thus: //namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ.// This indicates that a devotee who is under the protection of Kṛṣṇa is automatically situated as a //brāhmaṇa,// and such a //brāhmaṇa// is not illusioned. This is factual.
