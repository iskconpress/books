===== Purport =====

Due to pious activities, one can be enriched by four opulences: one may obtain birth in an aristocratic family, become highly educated, become very beautiful or get a sufficient quantity of riches. These are symptoms of pious activities performed in one's past life. In India it is still current for an aristocratic family never to consider a marriage with a common family. Though the caste may be the same, to maintain the aristocracy such marriages are rejected. No poor man will dare marry the daughter of a rich man. Because of this, when the elderly //brāhmaṇa// offered the young //brāhmaṇa// his daughter, the young //brāhmaṇa// did not believe that it would be possible to marry her. Therefore he asked the elderly //brāhmaṇa// why he was proposing something unprecedented (//asambhava//). It was unheard of for an aristocratic person to offer his daughter to a person who was both uneducated and poor.
