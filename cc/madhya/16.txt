~~Title:Cc. Madhya 16: The Lord’s Attempt to Go to Vṛndāvana~~

====== The Lord’s Attempt to Go to Vṛndāvana ======

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura gives the following summary of this chapter in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to go to Vṛndāvana, Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya indirectly presented many obstructions. In due course of time, all the devotees of Bengal visited Jagannātha Purī for the third year. This time, all the wives of the Vaiṣṇavas brought many types of food, intending to extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī. When the devotees arrived, Caitanya Mahāprabhu sent his blessings in the form of garlands. In that year also, the Guṇḍicā temple was cleansed, and when the Cāturmāsya period was over, all the devotees returned to their homes in Bengal. Caitanya Mahāprabhu forbade Nityānanda to visit Nīlācala every year. Questioned by the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma, Caitanya Mahāprabhu again repeated the symptoms of a Vaiṣṇava. Vidyānidhi also came to Jagannātha Purī and saw the festival of Oḍana-ṣaṣṭhī. When the devotees bade farewell to the Lord, the Lord was determined to go to Vṛndāvana, and on the day of Vijaya-daśamī, He departed.

Mahārāja Pratāparudra made various arrangements for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's trip to Vṛndāvana. When He crossed the River Citrotpalā, Rāmānanda Rāya, Mardarāja and Haricandana went with Him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Gadādhara Paṇḍita to go to Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī, but he did not abide by this order. From Kaṭaka, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again requested Gadādhara Paṇḍita to return to Nīlācala, and He bade farewell to Rāmānanda Rāya from Bhadraka. After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu crossed the border of Orissa state, and He arrived at Pānihāṭi by boat. Thereafter He visited the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita, and from there He went to Kumārahaṭṭa and eventually to Kuliyā, where He excused many offenders. From there He went to Rāmakeli, where He saw Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana and accepted them as His chief disciples. Returning from Rāmakeli, He met Raghunātha dāsa and after giving him instructions sent him back home. Thereafter the Lord returned to Nīlācala and began to make plans to go to Vṛndāvana without a companion.

  ; [[.16:1|Cc. Madhya 16.1]]
  : By the nectar of His personal glance, the cloud known as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu poured water upon the garden of Gauḍa-deśa and revived the people, who were like creepers and plants burning in the forest fire of material existence.

  ; [[.16:2|Cc. Madhya 16.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Advaitacandra! All glories to all the devotees of the Lord!

  ; [[.16:3|Cc. Madhya 16.3]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu decided to go to Vṛndāvana, and Mahārāja Pratāparudra became very morose upon hearing this news.

  ; [[.16:4|Cc. Madhya 16.4]]
  : The King therefore called for Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāmānanda Rāya, and he spoke the following submissive words to them.

  ; [[.16:5|Cc. Madhya 16.5]]
  : Pratāparudra Mahārāja said, "Please endeavor to keep Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu here at Jagannātha purī, for now He is thinking of going elsewhere.

  ; [[.16:6|Cc. Madhya 16.6]]
  : "Without Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this kingdom is not pleasing to me. Therefore please try to devise some plan to enable the Lord to stay here."

  ; [[.16:7|Cc. Madhya 16.7]]
  : After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself consulted Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, saying, "I shall go to Vṛndāvana."

  ; [[.16:8|Cc. Madhya 16.8]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya requested the Lord to observe first the Ratha-yātrā festival. Then when the month of Kārttika arrived, He could go to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.16:9|Cc. Madhya 16.9]]
  : However, when the month of Kārttika came, they both told the Lord, "Now it is very cold. It is better that You wait to see the Dola-yātrā festival and then go. That will be very nice."

  ; [[.16:10|Cc. Madhya 16.10]]
  : In this way they both presented many impediments, indirectly not granting the Lord permission to go to Vṛndāvana. They did this because they were afraid of separation from Him.

  ; [[.16:11|Cc. Madhya 16.11]]
  : Although the Lord is completely independent and incapable of being checked by anyone, He still did not go without the permission of His devotees.

  ; [[.16:12|Cc. Madhya 16.12]]
  : Then, for the third year, all the devotees of Bengal wanted to return again to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:13|Cc. Madhya 16.13]]
  : All the Bengali devotees gathered around Advaita Ācārya, and in great jubilation Advaita Ācārya departed to Jagannātha Purī to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:14-15|Cc. Madhya 16.14-15]]
  : Although the Lord told Nityānanda Prabhu to stay in Bengal and spread ecstatic love of God, Nityānanda left to go see Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Who can understand Nityānanda Prabhu's ecstatic love?

  ; [[.16:16-17|Cc. Madhya 16.16-17]]
  : All the devotees of Navadvīpa departed, including Ācāryaratna, Vidyānidhi, Śrīvāsa, Rāmāi, Vāsudeva, Murāri, Govinda and his two brothers and Rāghava Paṇḍita, who took bags of assorted foods. The inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma, carrying silken ropes, also departed.

  ; [[.16:18|Cc. Madhya 16.18]]
  : Narahari and Śrī Raghunandana, who were from the village of Khaṇḍa, and many other devotees also departed. Who can count them?

  ; [[.16:19|Cc. Madhya 16.19]]
  : Śivānanda Sena, who was in charge of the party, made arrangements to clear the tax collecting centers. He took care of all the devotees and happily traveled with them.

  ; [[.16:20|Cc. Madhya 16.20]]
  : Śivānanda Sena took care of all the necessities the devotees required. In particular, he made arrangements for residential quarters, and he knew the roads of Orissa.

  ; [[.16:21|Cc. Madhya 16.21]]
  : That year also all the wives of the devotees [ṭhākurāṇīs] also went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Sītādevī, the mother of Acyutānanda, went with Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.16:22|Cc. Madhya 16.22]]
  : Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita also took his wife, Mālinī, and the wife of Śivānanda Sena also went with her husband.

  ; [[.16:23|Cc. Madhya 16.23]]
  : Caitanya dāsa, the son of Śivānanda Sena, also jubilantly accompanied them as they went to see the Lord.

  ; [[.16:24|Cc. Madhya 16.24]]
  : The wife of Candraśekhara [Ācāryaratna] also went. I cannot speak of the greatness of Candraśekhara's love for the Lord.

  ; [[.16:25|Cc. Madhya 16.25]]
  : To offer Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu various types of food, all the wives of the great devotees brought from home various things that pleased Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:26|Cc. Madhya 16.26]]
  : As stated, Śivānanda Sena used to make all arrangements for the party's necessities. In particular, he used to pacify the men in charge of levying taxes, and he found resting places for everyone.

  ; [[.16:27|Cc. Madhya 16.27]]
  : Śivānanda Sena also supplied food to all the devotees and took care of them along the way. In this way, feeling great happiness he went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:28|Cc. Madhya 16.28]]
  : When they all arrived at Remuṇā, they went to see Lord Gopīnātha. In the temple there, Advaita Ācārya danced and chanted.

  ; [[.16:29|Cc. Madhya 16.29]]
  : All the priests of the temple had been previously acquainted with Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu; therefore they all came to offer great respects to the Lord.

  ; [[.16:30|Cc. Madhya 16.30]]
  : That night, all the great devotees remained in the temple, and the priests brought twelve pots of condensed milk, which they placed before Lord Nityānanda Prabhu.

  ; [[.16:31|Cc. Madhya 16.31]]
  : When the condensed milk was placed before Nityānanda Prabhu, He distributed the prasāda to everyone, and thus everyone's transcendental bliss increased.

  ; [[.16:32|Cc. Madhya 16.32]]
  : They then all discussed the story of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī's installation of the Gopāla Deity, and they discussed how Gopāla begged sandalwood from him.

  ; [[.16:33|Cc. Madhya 16.33]]
  : It was Gopīnātha who stole condensed milk for the sake of Mādhavendra Purī. This incident had been previously related by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself.

  ; [[.16:34|Cc. Madhya 16.34]]
  : This same narration was again related by Lord Nityānanda to all the devotees, and their transcendental bliss increased as they heard the story again.

  ; [[.16:35|Cc. Madhya 16.35]]
  : Walking and walking in this way, the devotees arrived at the city of Kaṭaka, where they remained for a day and saw the temple of Sākṣi-gopāla.

  ; [[.16:36|Cc. Madhya 16.36]]
  : When Nityānanda Prabhu described all the activities of Sākṣi-gopāla, transcendental bliss increased in the minds of all the Vaiṣṇavas.

  ; [[.16:37|Cc. Madhya 16.37]]
  : Everyone in the party was very anxious at heart to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore they hastily went on to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:38|Cc. Madhya 16.38]]
  : When they all arrived at a bridge called Āṭhāranālā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, hearing the news of their arrival, sent two garlands with Govinda.

  ; [[.16:39|Cc. Madhya 16.39]]
  : Govinda offered the two garlands to Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu, and They both became very happy.

  ; [[.16:40|Cc. Madhya 16.40]]
  : Indeed, They began chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa on that very spot, and, dancing and dancing, both Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu reached Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:41|Cc. Madhya 16.41]]
  : Then, for the second time, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sent garlands through Svarūpa Dāmodara and other personal associates. Thus they went forward, sent by the son of mother Śacī.

  ; [[.16:42|Cc. Madhya 16.42]]
  : When the devotees from Bengal reached Lake Narendra, Svarūpa Dāmodara and the others met them and offered them the garlands given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:43|Cc. Madhya 16.43]]
  : When the devotees finally reached the lion gate, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard the news and personally went to meet them.

  ; [[.16:44|Cc. Madhya 16.44]]
  : Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all His devotees visited Lord Jagannātha. Finally, accompanied by them all, He returned to His own residence.

  ; [[.16:45|Cc. Madhya 16.45]]
  : Vāṇīnātha Rāya and Kāśī Miśra then brought a large quantity of prasāda, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu distributed it with His own hand and fed them all.

  ; [[.16:46|Cc. Madhya 16.46]]
  : In the previous year, everyone had his own particular residence, and the same residences were again offered. Thus they all went to take rest.

  ; [[.16:47|Cc. Madhya 16.47]]
  : For four continuous months all the devotees remained there and enjoyed chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:48|Cc. Madhya 16.48]]
  : As in the previous year, they all washed the Guṇḍicā temple when the time for Ratha-yātrā arrived.

  ; [[.16:49|Cc. Madhya 16.49]]
  : The inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma delivered silken ropes to Lord Jagannātha, and as previously they all danced before the Lord's car.

  ; [[.16:50|Cc. Madhya 16.50]]
  : After dancing a great deal, they all went to a nearby garden and took rest beside a lake.

  ; [[.16:51|Cc. Madhya 16.51]]
  : One brāhmaṇa named Kṛṣṇadāsa, who was a resident of Rāḍha-deśa and a servant of Lord Nityānanda's, was a very fortunate person.

  ; [[.16:52|Cc. Madhya 16.52]]
  : It was Kṛṣṇadāsa who filled a great waterpot and poured it over the Lord while He was taking His bath. The Lord was greatly satisfied by this.

  ; [[.16:53|Cc. Madhya 16.53]]
  : The remnants of food offered to the Lord at Balagaṇḍi then arrived in great quantity, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all His devotees ate it.

  ; [[.16:54|Cc. Madhya 16.54]]
  : As in the previous year, the Lord, with all the devotees, saw the Ratha-yātrā festival and the Herā-pañcamī festival as well.

  ; [[.16:55|Cc. Madhya 16.55]]
  : Advaita Ācārya then extended an invitation to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and there was a great rainstorm connected with that incident.

  ; [[.16:56|Cc. Madhya 16.56]]
  : All these episodes have been elaborately described by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Then one day Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura extended an invitation to the Lord.

  ; [[.16:57|Cc. Madhya 16.57]]
  : The Lord's favorite vegetables were cooked by Mālinīdevī, the wife of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. She devotedly considered herself a maidservant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's, but in affection she was just like a mother.

  ; [[.16:58|Cc. Madhya 16.58]]
  : All the chief devotees, headed by Candraśekhara [Ācāryaratna] used to extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu periodically.

  ; [[.16:59|Cc. Madhya 16.59]]
  : At the end of the four-month Cāturmāsya period, Caitanya Mahāprabhu again consulted with Nityānanda Prabhu daily in a solitary place. No one could understand what Their consultation was about.

  ; [[.16:60|Cc. Madhya 16.60]]
  : Then Śrīla Advaita Ācārya said something to Caitanya Mahāprabhu through gestures and read some poetic passages, which no one understood.

  ; [[.16:61|Cc. Madhya 16.61]]
  : Seeing the face of Advaita Ācārya, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled. Understanding that the Lord had accepted the proposal, Advaita Ācārya started to dance.

  ; [[.16:62|Cc. Madhya 16.62]]
  : No one knew what Advaita Ācārya requested or what the Lord ordered. After embracing the Ācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade Him farewell.

  ; [[.16:63|Cc. Madhya 16.63]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told Nityānanda Prabhu, "Please hear Me, O holy man: I now request something of You. Kindly grant My request.

  ; [[.16:64|Cc. Madhya 16.64]]
  : "Do not come to Jagannātha Purī every year, but stay in Bengal and fulfill My desire."

  ; [[.16:65|Cc. Madhya 16.65]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "You can perform a task that even I cannot do. But for You, I cannot find anyone in Gauḍa-deśa who can fulfill My mission there."

  ; [[.16:66|Cc. Madhya 16.66]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu replied, "O Lord, You are the life, and I am the body. There is no difference between the body and life itself, but life is more important than the body.

  ; [[.16:67|Cc. Madhya 16.67]]
  : "By Your inconceivable energy, You can do whatever You like, and whatever You make Me do, I do without restriction."

  ; [[.16:68|Cc. Madhya 16.68]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Nityānanda Prabhu and bade Him farewell. He then bade farewell to all the other devotees.

  ; [[.16:69|Cc. Madhya 16.69]]
  : As in the previous year, one of the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma submitted a petition to the Lord, saying, "My Lord, kindly tell me what my duty is and how I should execute it."

  ; [[.16:70|Cc. Madhya 16.70]]
  : The Lord replied, "You should engage yourself in the service of the servants of Kṛṣṇa and always chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. If you do these two things, you will very soon attain shelter at Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet."

  ; [[.16:71|Cc. Madhya 16.71]]
  : The inhabitant of Kulīna-grāma said, "Please let me know who is actually a Vaiṣṇava and what his symptoms are." Understanding his mind, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled and gave the following reply.

  ; [[.16:72|Cc. Madhya 16.72]]
  : "A person who is always chanting the holy name of the Lord is to be considered a first-class Vaiṣṇava, and your duty is to serve his lotus feet."

  ; [[.16:73|Cc. Madhya 16.73]]
  : The following year, the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma again asked the Lord the same question. Hearing this question, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again taught them about the different types of Vaiṣṇavas.

  ; [[.16:74|Cc. Madhya 16.74]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "A first-class Vaiṣṇava is he whose very presence makes others chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.16:75|Cc. Madhya 16.75]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed different types of Vaiṣṇavas---the Vaiṣṇava, Vaiṣṇavatara and Vaiṣṇavatama. He thus successively explained all the symptoms of a Vaiṣṇava to the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma.

  ; [[.16:76|Cc. Madhya 16.76]]
  : Finally all the Vaiṣṇavas returned to Bengal, but that year Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi remained at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:77|Cc. Madhya 16.77]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi had a friendly, intimate relationship, and as far as discussing topics about Kṛṣṇa, they were situated on the same platform.

  ; [[.16:78|Cc. Madhya 16.78]]
  : Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi initiated Gadādhara Paṇḍita for the second time, and on the day of Oḍana-ṣaṣṭhī he saw the festival.

  ; [[.16:79|Cc. Madhya 16.79]]
  : When Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi saw that Lord Jagannātha was given a starched garment, he became a little hateful. In this way his mind was polluted.

  ; [[.16:80|Cc. Madhya 16.80]]
  : That night the brothers Lord Jagannātha and Balarāma came to Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi and, smiling, began to slap him.

  ; [[.16:81|Cc. Madhya 16.81]]
  : Although his cheeks were swollen from the slapping, Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi was very happy within. This incident has been elaborately described by Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana dāsa.

  ; [[.16:82|Cc. Madhya 16.82]]
  : Every year the devotees of Bengal would come and stay with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to see the Ratha-yātrā festival.

  ; [[.16:83|Cc. Madhya 16.83]]
  : Whatever happened during those years that is worth noting shall be described later.

  ; [[.16:84|Cc. Madhya 16.84]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed four years. He spent the first two years on His tour in South India.

  ; [[.16:85|Cc. Madhya 16.85]]
  : The other two years, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to go to Vṛndāvana, but He could not leave Jagannātha Purī because of Rāmānanda Rāya's tricks.

  ; [[.16:86|Cc. Madhya 16.86]]
  : During the fifth year, the devotees from Bengal came to see the Ratha-yātrā festival. After seeing it, they did not stay but returned to Bengal.

  ; [[.16:87|Cc. Madhya 16.87]]
  : Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu placed a proposal before Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāmānanda Rāya. He embraced them and spoke sweet words.

  ; [[.16:88|Cc. Madhya 16.88]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My desire to go to Vṛndāvana has very much increased. Because of your tricks, I have not been able to go there for the past two years.

  ; [[.16:89|Cc. Madhya 16.89]]
  : "This time I must go. Will you please give Me permission? Save for you two, I have no other resort.

  ; [[.16:90|Cc. Madhya 16.90]]
  : "In Bengal I have two shelters-my mother and the River Ganges. Both of them are very merciful.

  ; [[.16:91|Cc. Madhya 16.91]]
  : "I shall go to Vṛndāvana through Bengal and see both My mother and the River Ganges. Now would you two be pleased to give Me permission?"

  ; [[.16:92|Cc. Madhya 16.92]]
  : When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāmānanda Rāya heard these words, they began to consider that it was not at all good that they played so many tricks on the Lord.

  ; [[.16:93|Cc. Madhya 16.93]]
  : They both said, "Now that the rainy season is here, it will be difficult for You to travel. It is better to wait for Vijayā-daśamī before departing for Vṛndāvana."

  ; [[.16:94|Cc. Madhya 16.94]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased to thus receive their permission. He waited until the rainy season passed, and when the day of Vijayā-daśamī arrived, He departed for Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.16:95|Cc. Madhya 16.95]]
  : The Lord collected whatever remnants of food were left by Lord Jagannātha. He also took remnants of the Lord's kaḍāra ointment, sandalwood and ropes with Him.

  ; [[.16:96|Cc. Madhya 16.96]]
  : After taking Lord Jagannātha's permission early in the morning, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu departed, and all the devotees of Orissa began following Him.

  ; [[.16:97|Cc. Madhya 16.97]]
  : It was with great care that Caitanya Mahāprabhu forbade the Orissa devotees to follow Him. Accompanied by personal associates, He first went to Bhavānīpura.

  ; [[.16:98|Cc. Madhya 16.98]]
  : After Lord Caitanya reached Bhavānīpura, Rāmānanda Rāya arrived on his palanquin, and Vāṇīnātha Rāya had a large quantity of prasāda sent to the Lord.

  ; [[.16:99|Cc. Madhya 16.99]]
  : After taking prasāda, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained there for the night. Early in the morning, He began walking and finally reached Bhuvaneśvara.

  ; [[.16:100|Cc. Madhya 16.100]]
  : After reaching the city of Kaṭaka, He saw the temple of Gopāla, and a brāhmaṇa there named Svapneśvara invited the Lord to eat.

  ; [[.16:101|Cc. Madhya 16.101]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya invited all the others for their meals, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu made His resting place in a garden outside the temple.

  ; [[.16:102|Cc. Madhya 16.102]]
  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was taking rest beneath a bakula tree, Rāmānanda Rāya immediately went to Mahārāja Pratāparudra.

  ; [[.16:103|Cc. Madhya 16.103]]
  : The King was very happy to hear the news, and he hastily went there. Upon seeing the Lord, he fell flat to offer Him obeisances.

  ; [[.16:104|Cc. Madhya 16.104]]
  : Being overwhelmed with love, the King again and again got up and fell down. When he offered prayers, his whole body shivered, and tears fell from his eyes.

  ; [[.16:105|Cc. Madhya 16.105]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased to see the King's devotion, and He therefore stood up and embraced him.

  ; [[.16:106|Cc. Madhya 16.106]]
  : When the Lord embraced the King, the King again and again offered prayers and obeisances. In this way, the Lord's mercy brought tears from the King, and the Lord's body was bathed with these tears.

  ; [[.16:107|Cc. Madhya 16.107]]
  : Finally Rāmānanda Rāya pacified the King and made him sit down. The Lord also bestowed mercy upon him through His body, mind and words.

  ; [[.16:108|Cc. Madhya 16.108]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed such mercy to the King that from that day on the Lord became known as Pratāparudra-santrātā, the deliverer of Mahārāja Pratāparudra.

  ; [[.16:109|Cc. Madhya 16.109]]
  : All the governmental officers also paid their respects to the Lord, and finally the King and his men were bade farewell by the son of mother Śacī.

  ; [[.16:110|Cc. Madhya 16.110]]
  : The King then went outside and had orders written down and sent to the government servants within his kingdom.

  ; [[.16:111|Cc. Madhya 16.111]]
  : His orders read: "In every village you should construct new residences, and in five or seven new houses, you should store all kinds of food.

  ; [[.16:112|Cc. Madhya 16.112]]
  : "You should personally take the Lord to these newly constructed houses. Day and night you should engage in His service with a stick in your hands."

  ; [[.16:113|Cc. Madhya 16.113]]
  : The King ordered two respectable officers named Haricandana and Mardarāja to do whatever was necessary to carry out these orders.

  ; [[.16:114-115|Cc. Madhya 16.114-115]]
  : The King also ordered them to maintain a new boat on the banks of the river, and wherever Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took His bath or crossed to the other side of the river, they should establish a memorial column and make that place a great place of pilgrimage. "Indeed," said the King, "I will take my bath there. And let me also die there."

  ; [[.16:116|Cc. Madhya 16.116]]
  : The King continued, "At Caturdvāra, please construct new residential quarters. Now, Rāmānanda, you can return to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu."

  ; [[.16:117|Cc. Madhya 16.117]]
  : When the King heard that the Lord was leaving that evening, he immediately made arrangements for some elephants with small tents on their backs to be brought there. Then all the ladies of the palace got on the elephants.

  ; [[.16:118|Cc. Madhya 16.118]]
  : All these ladies went to the road the Lord was taking and remained there in a line. That evening, the Lord departed with His devotees.

  ; [[.16:119|Cc. Madhya 16.119]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the bank of the River Citrotpalā to take His bath, all the queens and ladies of the palace offered their obeisances to Him.

  ; [[.16:120|Cc. Madhya 16.120]]
  : Upon seeing the Lord, they all felt themselves overwhelmed with love of Godhead, and, tears pouring from their eyes, they began to chant the holy name, "Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!"

  ; [[.16:121|Cc. Madhya 16.121]]
  : There is no one as merciful as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu within all three worlds. Simply by seeing Him from a distance, one is overwhelmed with love of Godhead.

  ; [[.16:122|Cc. Madhya 16.122]]
  : The Lord then got into a new boat and crossed the river. Walking in the full moonlight, He finally reached the town known as Caturdvāra.

  ; [[.16:123|Cc. Madhya 16.123]]
  : The Lord spent the night there and in the morning took His bath. At that time, remnants of Lord Jagannātha's food arrived.

  ; [[.16:124|Cc. Madhya 16.124]]
  : Following the King's orders, the superintendent of the temple sent large quantities of prasāda every day, and it was carried by many persons.

  ; [[.16:125|Cc. Madhya 16.125]]
  : After accepting the prasāda, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stood up and started to go, chanting the holy names, "Hari! Hari!"

  ; [[.16:126|Cc. Madhya 16.126]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya, Mardarāja and Śrī Haricandana always went with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and rendered various services.

  ; [[.16:127-129|Cc. Madhya 16.127-129]]
  : Paramānanda Purī Gosvāmī, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Jagadānanda, Mukunda, Govinda, Kāśīśvara, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, Vakreśvara Paṇḍita, Gopīnātha Ācārya, Dāmodara Paṇḍita, Rāmāi, Nandāi and many other devotees accompanied the Lord. I have mentioned only the chief devotees. No one can describe the total number.

  ; [[.16:130|Cc. Madhya 16.130]]
  : When Gadādhara Paṇḍita started to go with the Lord, he was forbidden to come and was asked not to give up the vow of kṣetra-sannyāsa.

  ; [[.16:131|Cc. Madhya 16.131]]
  : When he was requested to return to Jagannātha Purī, Gadādhara Paṇḍita told the Lord, "Wherever You are staying is Jagannātha Purī. Let my so-called kṣetra-sannyāsa go to hell."

  ; [[.16:132|Cc. Madhya 16.132]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Gadādhara Paṇḍita to remain at Jagannātha Purī and engage in Gopīnātha's service, Gadādhara Paṇḍita replied, "One renders service to Gopīnātha a million times simply by seeing Your lotus feet."

  ; [[.16:133|Cc. Madhya 16.133]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "If you abandon His service, it will be My fault. It is better that you remain here and render service. That will be My satisfaction."

  ; [[.16:134|Cc. Madhya 16.134]]
  : The Paṇḍita replied, "Do not worry. All the faults will be on my head. I shall not accompany You but shall go alone.

  ; [[.16:135|Cc. Madhya 16.135]]
  : "I shall go to see Śacīmātā, but I shall not go for Your sake. I shall be responsible for the abandoning of my vow and service to Gopīnātha."

  ; [[.16:136|Cc. Madhya 16.136]]
  : Thus Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī traveled alone, but when they all arrived at Kaṭaka, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu called him, and he went in the Lord's company.

  ; [[.16:137|Cc. Madhya 16.137]]
  : No one can understand the loving intimacy between Gadādhara Paṇḍita and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Gadādhara Paṇḍita gave up his vow and service to Gopīnātha just as one gives up a piece of straw.

  ; [[.16:138|Cc. Madhya 16.138]]
  : Gadādhara Paṇḍita's behavior was very pleasing to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's heart. Nevertheless, the Lord took his hand and spoke to him, displaying the anger of love.

  ; [[.16:139|Cc. Madhya 16.139]]
  : "You have abandoned Gopīnātha's service and broken your vow to live in Purī. All that is now complete because you have come so far.

  ; [[.16:140|Cc. Madhya 16.140]]
  : "Your wanting to go with Me is simply a desire for sense gratification. In this way, you are breaking two religious principles, and because of this I am very unhappy.

  ; [[.16:141|Cc. Madhya 16.141]]
  : "If you want My happiness, please return to Nīlācala. You will simply condemn Me if you say any more about this matter."

  ; [[.16:142|Cc. Madhya 16.142]]
  : Saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu got into a boat, and Gadādhara Paṇḍita immediately fell down in an unconscious state.

  ; [[.16:143|Cc. Madhya 16.143]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya to take Gadādhara Paṇḍita with him. The Bhaṭṭācārya told Gadādhara Paṇḍita, "Get up! Such are the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:144|Cc. Madhya 16.144]]
  : "You should know that Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself violated His own promise just to keep the promise of Grandfather Bhīṣma.

  ; [[.16:145|Cc. Madhya 16.145]]
  : " 'Intending to make my promise true, Lord Kṛṣṇa broke His own promise not to take up a weapon at Kurukṣetra. With His outer garment falling off, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa jumped from His chariot, picked up a wheel and came running at me to kill me. Indeed, He rushed at me like a lion going to kill an elephant, and He caused the whole earth to tremble.'

  ; [[.16:146|Cc. Madhya 16.146]]
  : "Similarly, tolerating your separation, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has protected your vow with great endeavor."

  ; [[.16:147|Cc. Madhya 16.147]]
  : In this way Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya revived Gadādhara Paṇḍita. Then both of them, very much grief-stricken, returned to Jagannātha Purī, Nīlācala.

  ; [[.16:148|Cc. Madhya 16.148]]
  : All the devotees would abandon all kinds of duties for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's sake, yet the Lord did not like the devotees' giving up their promised duties.

  ; [[.16:149|Cc. Madhya 16.149]]
  : All these are the misgivings of loving affairs. Whoever listens to these incidents gets Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's shelter very soon.

  ; [[.16:150|Cc. Madhya 16.150]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His party arrived at Yājapura, the Lord asked the two government officers who had come with Him to return.

  ; [[.16:151|Cc. Madhya 16.151]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade farewell to the officers, and Rāya Rāmānanda continued on with the Lord. The Lord talked to Rāmānanda Rāya about Śrī Kṛṣṇa day and night.

  ; [[.16:152|Cc. Madhya 16.152]]
  : In each and every village, in compliance with the King's order, government officers constructed new houses and filled each of them with stocks of grains. Thus they served the Lord.

  ; [[.16:153|Cc. Madhya 16.153]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu finally arrived at Remuṇā, where He bade farewell to Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.16:154|Cc. Madhya 16.154]]
  : When Rāmānanda Rāya fell to the ground and lost consciousness, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took him upon His lap and began to cry.

  ; [[.16:155|Cc. Madhya 16.155]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya's separation from Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very difficult to describe. It is almost intolerable, and therefore I cannot describe it further.

  ; [[.16:156|Cc. Madhya 16.156]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu finally arrived at the border of the state of Orissa, a government officer came there to meet Him.

  ; [[.16:157|Cc. Madhya 16.157]]
  : For two or four days, the government officer served the Lord. He also gave the Lord detailed information of what was ahead.

  ; [[.16:158|Cc. Madhya 16.158]]
  : He informed the Lord that the territory ahead was ruled by a Moslem governor, who was a drunkard. Out of fear for this king, no one could walk the road freely.

  ; [[.16:159|Cc. Madhya 16.159]]
  : The jurisdiction of the Mohammedan government extended up to Pichaladā. Due to fear of the Mohammedans, no one would cross the river.

  ; [[.16:160|Cc. Madhya 16.160]]
  : Mahārāja Pratāparudra's government officer further informed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that He should stay at the Orissa border for some days so that a peaceful agreement could be negotiated with the Mohammedan governor. In that way, the Lord would be able to cross the river peacefully in a boat.

  ; [[.16:161|Cc. Madhya 16.161]]
  : At that time, a follower of the Mohammedan governor arrived at the Orissa encampment dressed in disguise.

  ; [[.16:162-163|Cc. Madhya 16.162-163]]
  : The Mohammedan spy saw the wonderful characteristics of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and when he returned to the Mohammedan governor, he told him, "A mendicant has come from Jagannātha Purī with many liberated persons.

  ; [[.16:164|Cc. Madhya 16.164]]
  : "All these saintly people incessantly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, and they all laugh, dance, chant and cry.

  ; [[.16:165|Cc. Madhya 16.165]]
  : "Many millions upon millions of people come to see Him, and after they see Him, they cannot return home.

  ; [[.16:166|Cc. Madhya 16.166]]
  : "All these people become like madmen. They simply dance and chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes they even cry and roll on the ground.

  ; [[.16:167|Cc. Madhya 16.167]]
  : "Actually these things cannot even be described. One can understand them only by seeing. By His influence, I accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

  ; [[.16:168|Cc. Madhya 16.168]]
  : After saying this, the messenger began to chant the holy names of Hari and Kṛṣṇa. He also began to laugh and cry, dance and sing exactly like a madman.

  ; [[.16:169|Cc. Madhya 16.169]]
  : Upon hearing this, the mind of the Mohammedan governor was changed. He then sent his own secretary to the representative of the Orissan government.

  ; [[.16:170|Cc. Madhya 16.170]]
  : The Mohammedan secretary came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When he offered his respects to the Lord's lotus feet and uttered the holy name of the Lord, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," he also was overwhelmed with ecstatic love.

  ; [[.16:171|Cc. Madhya 16.171]]
  : After calming down, the Mohammedan secretary offered his respects and informed the representative of the Orissan government, "The Mohammedan governor has sent me here.

  ; [[.16:172|Cc. Madhya 16.172]]
  : "If you agree, the Mohammedan governor will come here to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and then return.

  ; [[.16:173|Cc. Madhya 16.173]]
  : "The Mohammedan governor is very eager, and he has submitted this petition with great respect. It is a proposal for peace. You need not fear that we will fight."

  ; [[.16:174|Cc. Madhya 16.174]]
  : Upon hearing this proposal, the representative of the Orissan government, the mahā-pātra, was very astonished. He thought, "The Mohammedan governor is a drunkard. Who has changed his mind?

  ; [[.16:175|Cc. Madhya 16.175]]
  : "It must be Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself who has changed the Mohammedan's mind. Due to His presence and even due to His remembrance, the whole world is liberated."

  ; [[.16:176|Cc. Madhya 16.176]]
  : After thinking this, the mahā-pātra immediately informed the Mohammedan secretary, "It is a great fortune for your governor. Let him come visit Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:177|Cc. Madhya 16.177]]
  : "However, let me make it understood that he should come here without weapons. He may bring with him five or seven servants."

  ; [[.16:178|Cc. Madhya 16.178]]
  : The secretary returned to the Mohammedan governor and informed him of this news. Dressing himself like a Hindu, the Mohammedan governor then came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:179|Cc. Madhya 16.179]]
  : Upon seeing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu from a distant place, the Mohammedan governor fell to the ground and offered obeisances. Tears came to his eyes, and he was jubilant with ecstatic emotions.

  ; [[.16:180|Cc. Madhya 16.180]]
  : Arriving in that way, the Mohammedan governor was respectfully brought before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by the mahā-pātra. The governor then stood before the Lord with folded hands, and he chanted the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.16:181|Cc. Madhya 16.181]]
  : The governor then submissively asked, "Why was I born in a Mohammedan family? This is considered a low birth. Why didn't supreme Providence grant me a birth in a Hindu family?

  ; [[.16:182|Cc. Madhya 16.182]]
  : "If I had taken birth in a Hindu family, it would have been easy for me to remain near Your lotus feet. Since my body is now useless, let me die immediately."

  ; [[.16:183|Cc. Madhya 16.183]]
  : Upon hearing the governor's submissive statement, the mahā-pātra was overwhelmed with joy. He clasped the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and began to offer the following prayers.

  ; [[.16:184|Cc. Madhya 16.184]]
  : "Simply by hearing Your holy name, a caṇḍāla, lowest of men, can be purified. Now this conditioned soul has received Your personal interview.

  ; [[.16:185|Cc. Madhya 16.185]]
  : "It is no wonder that this Mohammedan governor has attained such results. Simply by seeing You, all this is possible.

  ; [[.16:186|Cc. Madhya 16.186]]
  : " 'To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of dog-eaters becomes immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or chants about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.' "

  ; [[.16:187|Cc. Madhya 16.187]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then glanced with mercy at the Mohammedan governor. Giving him assurance, He asked him to chant the holy names Kṛṣṇa and Hari.

  ; [[.16:188|Cc. Madhya 16.188]]
  : The Mohammedan governor then said, "Since You have so kindly accepted me, please give me some order so that I can render You some service."

  ; [[.16:189|Cc. Madhya 16.189]]
  : The Mohammedan governor then prayed for liberation from the unlimited sinful activities he had previously incurred by being envious of brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas and killing cows.

  ; [[.16:190|Cc. Madhya 16.190]]
  : Mukunda Datta then told the Mohammedan governor, "My dear sir, please hear. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wishes to go to the bank of the Ganges.

  ; [[.16:191|Cc. Madhya 16.191]]
  : "Please give Him all assistance so that He can go there. This is your first great order, and if you can comply, you will render a great service."

  ; [[.16:192|Cc. Madhya 16.192]]
  : After this, the Mohammedan governor offered prayers to the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as well as to the lotus feet of all His devotees. After that, the governor departed. Indeed, he was very pleased.

  ; [[.16:193|Cc. Madhya 16.193]]
  : Before the governor left, the mahā-pātra embraced him and offered him many material gifts. He thus established a friendship with him.

  ; [[.16:194|Cc. Madhya 16.194]]
  : The next morning the governor sent his secretary with many nicely decorated boats to bring Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to the other side of the river.

  ; [[.16:195|Cc. Madhya 16.195]]
  : The mahā-pātra crossed the river with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and when they reached the other shore, the Mohammedan governor personally received the Lord and worshiped His lotus feet.

  ; [[.16:196|Cc. Madhya 16.196]]
  : One of the boats had been newly constructed, and it had a room in the middle. It was on this boat that they put Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates.

  ; [[.16:197|Cc. Madhya 16.197]]
  : Finally Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade farewell to the mahā-pātra. Standing on the river bank and looking at the boat, the mahā-pātra began to cry.

  ; [[.16:198|Cc. Madhya 16.198]]
  : The Mohammedan governor then personally accompanied Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because of pirates, the governor took ten boats, which were full with many soldiers.

  ; [[.16:199|Cc. Madhya 16.199]]
  : The Mohammedan governor accompanied Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu past Mantreśvara. This place was very dangerous due to pirates. He took the Lord to a place named Pichaldā, which was near Mantreśvara.

  ; [[.16:200|Cc. Madhya 16.200]]
  : Finally Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade the governor farewell. The intense ecstatic love exhibited by the governor cannot be described.

  ; [[.16:201|Cc. Madhya 16.201]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes are all uncommon. Whoever listens to His activities becomes glorious, and his life becomes perfect.

  ; [[.16:202|Cc. Madhya 16.202]]
  : The Lord finally reached Pānihāṭi, and, as an act of mercy, He gave the captain of the boat one of His personal garments.

  ; [[.16:203|Cc. Madhya 16.203]]
  : The place called Pānihāṭi was located on the bank of the Ganges. After hearing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had arrived, all kinds of men assembled both on land and on the water.

  ; [[.16:204|Cc. Madhya 16.204]]
  : At length Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was taken away by Rāghava Paṇḍita. There was a great crowd assembled along the way, and the Lord reached Rāghava Paṇḍita's residence with great difficulty.

  ; [[.16:205|Cc. Madhya 16.205]]
  : The Lord stayed at Rāghava Paṇḍita's place for only one day. The next morning, He went to Kumārahaṭṭa, where Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura lived.

  ; [[.16:206|Cc. Madhya 16.206]]
  : From the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, the Lord went to the house of Śivānanda Sena and then to the house of Vāsudeva Datta.

  ; [[.16:207|Cc. Madhya 16.207]]
  : The Lord remained some time at the house of Vidyā-vācaspati, but then, because it was too crowded, He went to Kuliyā.

  ; [[.16:208|Cc. Madhya 16.208]]
  : When the Lord stayed at the house of Mādhava dāsa, many hundreds and thousands of people came to see Him.

  ; [[.16:209|Cc. Madhya 16.209]]
  : The Lord stayed there for seven days and delivered all kinds of offenders and sinners.

  ; [[.16:210|Cc. Madhya 16.210]]
  : After leaving Kuliyā, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the house of Advaita Ācārya at Śāntipura. It was there that the Lord's mother, Śacīmātā, met Him and was thus relieved of her great unhappiness.

  ; [[.16:211|Cc. Madhya 16.211]]
  : The Lord then visited the village known as Rāmakeli and the place known as Kānāi Nāṭaśālā. From there He returned to Śāntipura.

  ; [[.16:212|Cc. Madhya 16.212]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed in Śāntipura for ten days. This has all been described very elaborately by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura.

  ; [[.16:213|Cc. Madhya 16.213]]
  : I will not narrate these incidents because they have already been described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. There is no need to repeat the same information, for such repetition would unlimitedly increase the size of this book.

  ; [[.16:214-215|Cc. Madhya 16.214-215]]
  : Those narrations tell how Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu met the brothers Rūpa and Sanātana and how Nṛsiṁhānanda decorated the road. I have already described these in an earlier synopsis of this book; therefore I will not repeat the narrations here.

  ; [[.16:216|Cc. Madhya 16.216]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Śāntipura, Raghunātha dāsa came to meet Him.

  ; [[.16:217|Cc. Madhya 16.217]]
  : Two brothers named Hiraṇya and Govardhana, who were residents of Saptagrāma, had an income of 1,200,000 rupees.

  ; [[.16:218|Cc. Madhya 16.218]]
  : Both Hiraṇya Majumadāra and Govardhana Majumadāra were very opulent and magnanimous. They were well-behaved and devoted to brahminical culture. They belonged to an aristocratic family, and among religionists they were predominant.

  ; [[.16:219|Cc. Madhya 16.219]]
  : Practically all the brāhmaṇas residing in Nadia were dependent on the charity of Hiraṇya and Govardhana, who gave them money, land and villages.

  ; [[.16:220|Cc. Madhya 16.220]]
  : Nīlāmbara Cakravartī, the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was much worshiped by the two brothers, but Nīlāmbara Cakravartī used to treat them as his own brothers.

  ; [[.16:221|Cc. Madhya 16.221]]
  : Formerly, these two brothers rendered much service to Miśra Purandara, the father of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because of this, the Lord knew them very well.

  ; [[.16:222|Cc. Madhya 16.222]]
  : Raghunātha dāsa was the son of Govardhana Majumadāra. From childhood, he was uninterested in material enjoyment.

  ; [[.16:223|Cc. Madhya 16.223]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Śāntipura after accepting the renounced order, Raghunātha dāsa met Him.

  ; [[.16:224|Cc. Madhya 16.224]]
  : When Raghunātha dāsa went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he fell at the Lord's lotus feet in ecstatic love. Showing him mercy, the Lord touched him with His feet.

  ; [[.16:225|Cc. Madhya 16.225]]
  : Raghunātha dāsa's father, Govardhana, always rendered much service to Advaita Ācārya. Consequently Advaita Ācārya was very pleased with the family.

  ; [[.16:226|Cc. Madhya 16.226]]
  : When Raghunātha dāsa was there, Advaita Ācārya favored him by giving him the food remnants left by the Lord. Raghunātha dāsa was thus engaged for five or seven days by rendering service to the Lord's lotus feet.

  ; [[.16:227|Cc. Madhya 16.227]]
  : After bidding farewell to Raghunātha dāsa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Jagannātha Purī. After returning home, Raghunātha dāsa became mad with ecstatic love.

  ; [[.16:228|Cc. Madhya 16.228]]
  : Raghunātha dāsa used to run away from home again and again to go to Jagannātha Purī, but his father kept binding him and bringing him back.

  ; [[.16:229|Cc. Madhya 16.229]]
  : His father even had five watchmen guard him day and night. Four personal servants were employed to look after his comfort, and two brāhmaṇas were employed to cook for him.

  ; [[.16:230|Cc. Madhya 16.230]]
  : In this way, eleven people were incessantly keeping Raghunātha dāsa under control. Thus he could not go to Jagannātha Purī, and because of this he was very unhappy.

  ; [[.16:231|Cc. Madhya 16.231]]
  : When Raghunātha dāsa learned that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had arrived at Śāntipura, he submitted a request to his father.

  ; [[.16:232|Cc. Madhya 16.232]]
  : Raghunātha dāsa asked his father, "Please give me permission to go see the lotus feet of the Lord. If you do not, my life will not remain within this body."

  ; [[.16:233|Cc. Madhya 16.233]]
  : Hearing this request, Raghunātha dāsa's father agreed. Giving him many servants and materials, the father sent him to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, requesting him to return soon.

  ; [[.16:234|Cc. Madhya 16.234]]
  : For seven days Raghunātha dāsa associated with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Śāntipura. During those days and nights, he had the following thoughts.

  ; [[.16:235|Cc. Madhya 16.235]]
  : Raghunātha dāsa thought, "How shall I be able to get free from the hands of the watchmen? How shall I be able to go with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Nīlācala?"

  ; [[.16:236|Cc. Madhya 16.236]]
  : Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was omniscient, He could understand Raghunātha dāsa's mind. The Lord therefore instructed him with the following reassuring words.

  ; [[.16:237|Cc. Madhya 16.237]]
  : "Be patient and return home. Don't be a crazy fellow. By and by you will be able to cross the ocean of material existence.

  ; [[.16:238|Cc. Madhya 16.238]]
  : "You should not make yourself a showbottle devotee and become a false renunciant. For the time being, enjoy the material world in a befitting way and do not become attached to it."

  ; [[.16:239|Cc. Madhya 16.239]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued: "Within your heart, you should keep yourself very faithful, but externally you may behave like an ordinary man. Thus Kṛṣṇa will soon be very pleased and deliver you from the clutches of māyā.

  ; [[.16:240|Cc. Madhya 16.240]]
  : "You may see me at Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī, when I return after visiting Vṛndāvana. By that time you can think of some trick to escape.

  ; [[.16:241|Cc. Madhya 16.241]]
  : "What kind of means you will have to use at that time will be revealed by Kṛṣṇa. If one has Kṛṣṇa's mercy, no one can check him."

  ; [[.16:242|Cc. Madhya 16.242]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bade farewell to Raghunātha dāsa, who returned home and did exactly what the Lord told him.

  ; [[.16:243|Cc. Madhya 16.243]]
  : After returning home, Raghunātha dāsa gave up all craziness and external pseudo renunciation and engaged in his household duties without attachment.

  ; [[.16:244|Cc. Madhya 16.244]]
  : When Raghunātha dāsa's father and mother saw that their son was acting like a householder, they became very happy. Because of this, they slackened their guard.

  ; [[.16:245-246|Cc. Madhya 16.245-246]]
  : Meanwhile, at Śāntipura, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu assembled all His devotees-headed by Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu-embraced them all and asked their permission to return to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:247|Cc. Madhya 16.247]]
  : Because He had met them all at Śāntipura, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested all the devotees not to go to Jagannātha Purī that year.

  ; [[.16:248|Cc. Madhya 16.248]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I shall certainly go to Vṛndāvana from Jagannātha Purī. If all of you give Me permission, I shall return here again without difficulty."

  ; [[.16:249|Cc. Madhya 16.249]]
  : Clasping the feet of His mother, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very humbly requested her permission. Thus she gave Him leave to go to Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.16:250|Cc. Madhya 16.250]]
  : Śrīmatī Śacīdevī was sent back to Navadvīpa, and the Lord and His devotees started for Jagannātha Purī, Nīlādri.

  ; [[.16:251|Cc. Madhya 16.251]]
  : The devotees who accompanied Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rendered all kinds of service on the way to Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī. Thus in great happiness the Lord returned.

  ; [[.16:252|Cc. Madhya 16.252]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived in Jagannātha Purī, He visited the temple of the Lord. News then spread all over the city that He had returned.

  ; [[.16:253|Cc. Madhya 16.253]]
  : All the devotees then came and met the Lord with great happiness. The Lord also embraced each of them in great ecstatic love.

  ; [[.16:254|Cc. Madhya 16.254]]
  : Kāśī Miśra, Rāmānanda Rāya, Pradyumna, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Vāṇīnātha Rāya, Śikhi Māhiti and all the other devotees met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.16:255|Cc. Madhya 16.255]]
  : Gadādhara Paṇḍita also came and met the Lord. Then, before all the devotees, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to speak as follows.

  ; [[.16:256|Cc. Madhya 16.256]]
  : "It was My decision to go to Vṛndāvana through Bengal in order to see My mother and the River Ganges.

  ; [[.16:257|Cc. Madhya 16.257]]
  : "Thus I went to Bengal, but thousands of devotees began to follow Me.

  ; [[.16:258|Cc. Madhya 16.258]]
  : "Many hundreds and thousands of people came to see Me out of curiosity, and due to such a large crowd I could not travel very freely on the road.

  ; [[.16:259|Cc. Madhya 16.259]]
  : "Indeed, the crowd was so large that the house and the boundary walls of the house where I stayed were destroyed, and wherever I looked I could see only large crowds.

  ; [[.16:260|Cc. Madhya 16.260]]
  : "With great difficulty I went to the town of Rāmakeli, where I met two brothers named Rūpa and Sanātana.

  ; [[.16:261|Cc. Madhya 16.261]]
  : "These two brothers are great devotees and suitable recipients of Kṛṣṇa's mercy, but in their ordinary dealings they are government officials, ministers to the King.

  ; [[.16:262|Cc. Madhya 16.262]]
  : "Śrīla Rūpa and Sanātana are very experienced in education, devotional service, intelligence and strength, yet they think themselves inferior to straw in the street.

  ; [[.16:263-264|Cc. Madhya 16.263-264]]
  : "Indeed, the humility of these two brothers could even melt stone. Because I was very pleased with their behavior, I told them, 'Although you are both very exalted, you consider yourselves inferior, and because of this, Kṛṣṇa will very soon deliver you.'

  ; [[.16:265-266|Cc. Madhya 16.265-266]]
  : "After speaking to them in this way, I bade them farewell. As I was leaving, Sanātana told Me, 'It is not appropriate for one to be followed by a crowd of thousands when one goes to Vṛndāvana.'

  ; [[.16:267|Cc. Madhya 16.267]]
  : "Although I heard this, I did not pay it any attention. In the morning, however, I went to the place named Kānāi Nāṭaśālā.

  ; [[.16:268|Cc. Madhya 16.268]]
  : "At night, however, I considered what Sanātana had told Me.

  ; [[.16:269|Cc. Madhya 16.269]]
  : "I decided that Sanātana had spoken very well. I was certainly being followed by a large crowd, and when people would see so many men, they would surely rebuke Me, saying, 'Here is another imposter.'

  ; [[.16:270|Cc. Madhya 16.270]]
  : "I then began to consider that Vṛndāvana is a very solitary place. It is invincible and very difficult to attain. I therefore decided to go there alone or, at the most, take only one person with Me.

  ; [[.16:271|Cc. Madhya 16.271]]
  : "Mādhavendra Purī went to Vṛndāvana alone, and Kṛṣṇa, on the pretext of giving him milk, granted him an audience.

  ; [[.16:272|Cc. Madhya 16.272]]
  : "I then understood that I was going to Vṛndāvana like a magician with his show, and this is certainly not good. No one should go to Vṛndāvana with so many men.

  ; [[.16:273|Cc. Madhya 16.273]]
  : "I have therefore resolved to go alone or, at the utmost, with one servant. In this way, My journey to Vṛndāvana will be beautiful.

  ; [[.16:274|Cc. Madhya 16.274]]
  : "I thought, 'Instead of going to Vṛndāvana alone, I am going with soldiers and the beating of drums.'

  ; [[.16:275|Cc. Madhya 16.275]]
  : "I therefore said, 'Fie upon Me!' and being very agitated, I returned to the banks of the Ganges.

  ; [[.16:276|Cc. Madhya 16.276]]
  : "I then left all the devotees there and brought only five or six persons with Me.

  ; [[.16:277|Cc. Madhya 16.277]]
  : "Now I wish that you all will be pleased with Me and give Me good consultation. Tell Me how I shall be able to go to Vṛndāvana without impediments.

  ; [[.16:278|Cc. Madhya 16.278]]
  : "I left Gadādhara Paṇḍita here, and he became very unhappy. For this reason I could not go to Vṛndāvana."

  ; [[.16:279|Cc. Madhya 16.279]]
  : Being encouraged by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's words, Gadādhara Paṇḍita became absorbed in ecstatic love. Immediately clasping the lotus feet of the Lord, he began to speak with great humility.

  ; [[.16:280|Cc. Madhya 16.280]]
  : Gadādhara Paṇḍita said, "Wherever You stay is Vṛndāvana, as well as the River Yamunā, the River Ganges and all other places of pilgrimage.

  ; [[.16:281|Cc. Madhya 16.281]]
  : "Although wherever You stay is Vṛndāvana, You still go to Vṛndāvana just to instruct people. Otherwise, You do whatever You think best."

  ; [[.16:282|Cc. Madhya 16.282]]
  : Taking this opportunity, Gadādhara Paṇḍita said, "Just now the four months of the rainy season have begun. You should therefore spend the next four months in Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.16:283|Cc. Madhya 16.283]]
  : "After remaining here for four months, You may be free to do as You like. Actually no one can stop You from going or remaining."

  ; [[.16:284|Cc. Madhya 16.284]]
  : Upon hearing this statement, the devotees present at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stated that Gadādhara Paṇḍita had properly presented their desire.

  ; [[.16:285|Cc. Madhya 16.285]]
  : Being requested by all the devotees, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu agreed to remain at Jagannātha Purī for four months. Hearing this, King Pratāparudra became very happy.

  ; [[.16:286|Cc. Madhya 16.286]]
  : That day Gadādhara Paṇḍita extended an invitation to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Lord took His lunch at his place with the other devotees.

  ; [[.16:287|Cc. Madhya 16.287]]
  : No ordinary human being can possibly describe Gadādhara Paṇḍita's affectionate presentation of food and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's tasting this food.

  ; [[.16:288|Cc. Madhya 16.288]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu performs His pastimes, which are unlimited and unfathomable. Somehow or other, these have briefly been described. It is not possible to describe them elaborately.

  ; [[.16:289|Cc. Madhya 16.289]]
  : Although Lord Anantadeva is always describing the pastimes of the Lord with His thousands of mouths, He cannot reach the end of even one of the Lord's pastimes.

  ; [[.16:290|Cc. Madhya 16.290]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
