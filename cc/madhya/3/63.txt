Although the Hindus and Muslims lived together in a very friendly manner, still there were distinctions between them. The Muslims were considered //yavanas,// or low-born, and whenever a Muslim was invited, he would be fed outside of the house. Although personally called by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu to take //prasāda// with Them, still, out of great humility, Haridāsa Ṭhākura submitted, "I shall take the //prasāda// outside of the house." Although Haridāsa Ṭhākura was an exalted Vaiṣṇava accepted by Advaita Ācārya, Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, nonetheless, in order not to disturb social tranquillity, he humbly kept himself in the position of a Muslim, outside the jurisdiction of the Hindu community. Therefore he proposed to take //prasāda// outside the house. Although he was in an exalted position and equal to other great Vaiṣṇavas, he considered himself a //pāpiṣṭha,// a most sinful man, and //adhama,// the lowest among men. Although a Vaiṣṇava may be very much advanced spiritually, he keeps himself externally humble and submissive.
