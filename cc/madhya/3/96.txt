===== Purport =====

The word //avadhūta// refers to one above all rules and regulations. Sometimes, not observing all the rules and regulations of a //sannyāsī,// Nityānanda Prabhu exhibited the behavior of a mad //avadhūta.// He threw the remnants of food on the ground, and some of these remnants touched the body of Advaita Ācārya. Advaita Ācārya accepted this happily because He presented Himself as a member of the community of //smārta-brāhmaṇas.// By touching the remnants of food thrown by Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Ācārya immediately felt Himself purified of all //smārta// contamination. The remnants of food left by a pure Vaiṣṇava are called //mahā-mahā-prasāda.// This is completely spiritual and is identified with Lord Viṣṇu. Such remnants are not ordinary. The spiritual master is to be considered on the stage of //paramahaṁsa// and beyond the jurisdiction of the //varṇāśrama// institution. The remnants of food left by the spiritual master and similar //paramahaṁsas// or pure Vaiṣṇavas are purifying. When an ordinary person touches such //prasāda,// his mind is purified, and his mind is raised to the status of a pure //brāhmaṇa.// The behavior and statements of Advaita Ācārya are meant for the understanding of ordinary people who are unaware of the strength of spiritual values, not knowing the potency of food left by the bona fide spiritual master and pure Vaiṣṇavas.
