The word //bāḍāila,// meaning "increased," is very significant in this verse. It is a sophisticated word used by the //gṛhasthas// in Bengal. Whenever food is prepared and we take away a portion, the food is actually decreased. But here it is the system to say //bāḍāila,// or "increased." If food is prepared for Kṛṣṇa and offered to Him and the Vaiṣṇavas, the stock is increased, never decreased.
