===== Purport =====

It is the duty of all //gṛhasthas// to invite a //sannyāsī// to their homes if he happens to be in the neighborhood or village. This very system is still current in India. If a //sannyāsī// is in the neighborhood of a village, he is inv ted by all householders, one after another. As long as a //sannyāsī// remains in the village, he enlightens the inhabitants in spiritual understanding. In other words, a //sannyāsī// has no housing or food problems even when he travels extensively. Even though Advaita Ācārya was supplying Caitanya Mahāprabhu with //prasāda,// the other devotees from Navadvīpa and Śāntipura also desired to offer Him //prasāda.//
