Although Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Muslim family, he was accepted as a properly initiated //brāhmaṇa.// As such, he had every right to enter the temple of Jagannātha Purī, but because there were some rules and regulations stipulating that only //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras// (members of the //varṇāśrama-dharma// system) could enter, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, out of his great humility, did not want to violate these existing rules. He therefore said that he did not have the strength to enter into the temple, and he pointed out that if Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived within the temple, there would be no way for Haridāsa Ṭhākura to see Him. Later, when Haridāsa Ṭhākura went to Jagannātha Purī, he lived outside the temple on the beach by the sea. A monastery has now been erected there, known as Siddhabakula Maṭha. people go there to see the place of worship (bhajana-kuṭīra) of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.
