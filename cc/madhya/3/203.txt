===== Purport =====

Advaita Ācārya set an ideal example for all householder devotees in His receiving of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees and in His execution of a daily festival at His home. If one has the proper means and wealth, he should occasionally invite the devotees of Lord Caitanya, who are engaged in preaching all over the world, and hold a festival at home simply by distributing //prasāda// and talking about Kṛṣṇa during the day and holding congregational chanting for at least three hours in the evening. This procedure must be adopted in all centers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Thus they will daily perform //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.32) the daily performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña// is recommended for this age (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ//). One should worship Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His four associates, the Pañca-tattva, by distributing //prasāda// and holding congregational chanting. Indeed, that //yajña// or sacrifice is most recommended in this Age of Kali. In this age, other //yajñas// are not possible to perform, but this //yajña// can be performed everywhere and anywhere without difficulty.
