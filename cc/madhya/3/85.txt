===== Purport =====

There is always a difference of opinion between a //smārta-brāhmaṇa// and a Vaiṣṇava //gosvāmī.// There are even //smārta// opinions and Vaiṣṇava //gosvāmī// opinions available in astrological and astronomical calculations. By calling Nityānanda Prabhu a //bhraṣṭa avadhūta// (a rejected //paramahaṁsa//), Advaita Ācārya Prabhu in a sense accepted Nityānanda Prabhu as a //paramahaṁsa.// In other words, Nityānanda Prabhu had nothing to do with the rules governing //smārta-brāhmaṇas.// Thus under pretense of condemning Him, Advaita Ācārya was actually praising Him. In the //avadhūta// stage, the //paramahaṁsa// stage, which is the supermost stage, one may appear to be //viṣayī,// on the platform of sense gratification, but in actuality he has nothing to do with sense gratification. At that stage, a person sometimes accepts the symptoms and dress of a //sannyāsī// and sometimes does not. Sometimes he dresses like a householder. We should know, however, that these are all joking words between Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu. They are not to be taken as insults.

In Khaḍadaha, sometimes people misunderstood Nityānanda Prabhu to belong to the //śākta-sampradāya,// whose philosophy is //antaḥ śāktaḥ bahiḥ śaivaḥ sabhāyāṁ vaiṣṇavo mataḥ.// According to the //śākta-sampradāya,// a person called //kaulāvadhūta// thinks materially while externally appearing to be a great devotee of Lord Śiva. When such a person is in an assembly of Vaiṣṇavas, he appears like a Vaiṣṇava. Actually Nityānanda Prabhu did not belong to such a community. Nityānanda Prabhu was always a //brahmacārī// of a //sannyāsī// of the //vaidika// order. Actually He was a //paramahaṁsa.// Sometimes He is accepted to be a disciple of Lakṣmīpati Tīrtha. If He is so accepted, Nityānanda Prabhu belonged to the Madhva-sampradāya. He did not belong to the //tāntrika-sampradāya// of Bengal.
