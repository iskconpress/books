The cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, is very nicely explained by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu authoritatively. It is not that everyone has to take //sannyāsa// like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone can execute the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness at home, as ordered by the Lord. Everyone can congregationally chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// One can also discuss the subject matter of the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and install Deities of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Gaura-Nitāi or both and worship them very carefully in one's own home. It is not that we have to open different centers all over the world. Whoever cares for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can install Deities at home and, under superior guidance, worship the Deity regularly, chanting the //mahā-mantra// and discussing the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// We are actually teaching in our classes how to go about this. One who feels that he is not yet ready to live in a temple or undergo strict regulative principles in the temple-especially householders who live with a wife and children-can start a center at home by installing the Deity, worshiping the Lord morning and evening, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and discussing the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Anyone can do this at home without difficulty, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested all the devotees present there to do so.
