===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is here telling Advaita Ācārya that it is not befitting for a //sannyāsī// to accept nice beds to lie on or to chew cloves and cardamom and have his body smeared with sandalwood pulp. Nor is it befitting for him to accept fragrant garlands and have his legs massaged by a pure Vaiṣṇava. "You have already made Me dance according to Your vow," Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. "Now please stop it. You can go and take Your lunch with Mukunda and Haridāsa."
