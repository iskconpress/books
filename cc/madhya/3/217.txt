Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that while Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu passed through Bengal, He passed through Āṭisārā-grāma, Varāha-grāma and Chatrabhoga. He then reached the Orissa province, where He passed through Prayāga-ghāṭa, Suvarṇarekhā, Remuṇā, Yājapura, Vaitaraṇī, Daśāśvamedha-ghāṭa, Kaṭaka, Mahānadī, Bhuvaneśvara (where there is a big lake known as Bindu-sarovara), Kamalapura and Āthāranālā. In this way, passing through all these and other places, He reached Jagannātha Purī.
