Harṣa is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu. Harṣa// is experienced when one finally attains the desired goal of life and consequently becomes very glad. When //harṣa// is present, the body shivers, and one's bodily hairs stand on end. There are perspiration, tears and an outburst of passion and madness. The mouth becomes swollen, and one experiences inertia and illusion. When a person attains his desired object and feels very fortunate, the luster of his body increases. Because of his own qualities and feelings of greatness, he does not care for anyone else, and this is called //garva,// or pride. In this condition one utters prayers and does not reply to others' inquiries. Seeing one's own body, concealing one's desires and not heeding the words of others are symptoms visible in the ecstasy of //garva.//
