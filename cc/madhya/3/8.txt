In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the //sannyāsa// order and recommended the determination of the Avantīpura //bhikṣu// to engage in the service of Mukunda. He accepted the //brāhmaṇa's// version due to his determination to serve Mukunda. The //sannyāsī// dress is actually an attraction for material formality. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like such formality, but He wanted the essence of it-service to Mukunda. Such determination in any condition is //parātma-niṣṭhā.// That is required. The conclusion is that the //sannyāsa// order depends not on the dress but the determination to serve Mukunda.
