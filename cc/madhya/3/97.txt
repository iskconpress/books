===== Purport =====

The words //sahaje pāgala// ("by nature a madman") indicate that Nityānanda Prabhu was transcendentally situated on the //paramahaṁsa// stage. Because He always remembered Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Their service, this was transcendental madness. Śrī Advaita Ācārya was pointing out this fact.
