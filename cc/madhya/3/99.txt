**Nityānanda Prabhu replied, "These are the remnants of food left by Lord Kṛṣṇa. If You take them to be ordinary remnants, You have committed an offense."**

===== Purport =====

In the //Bṛhad-viṣṇu Purāṇa// it is stated that one who considers //mahā-prasāda// to be equal to ordinary rice and //dāl// certainly commits a great offense. Ordinary edibles are touchable and untouchable, but there are no such dualistic considerations where //prasāda// is concerned. //prasāda// is transcendental, and there are no transformations or contaminations, just as there are no contaminations or transformations in the body of Lord Viṣṇu Himself. Thus even if one is a //brāhmaṇa// he is certain to be attacked by leprosy and bereft of all family members if he makes such dualistic considerations. Such an offender goes to hell, never to return. This is the injunction of the //Bṛhad-viṣṇu Purāṇa.//
