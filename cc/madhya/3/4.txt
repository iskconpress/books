**After accepting the sannyāsa order, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of intense love for Kṛṣṇa, started for Vṛndāvana. However, He mistakenly wandered about in a trance continuously for three days in the tract of land known as Rāḍha-deśa.**

===== Purport =====

The word Rāḍha-deśa comes from the word //rāṣṭra,// or "state." From //rāṣṭra// the perverted word //rāḍha// has come. The part of Bengal on the western side of the Ganges is known as Rāḍha-deśa. Another name is Pauṇḍra-deśa or Peṅḍo-deśa. The word //peṅḍo// is a perverted form of the word //pauṇḍra.// It appears that the capital of Rāṣṭra-deśa was situated in that part of Bengal.
