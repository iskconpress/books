===== Purport =====

Devastation is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// as a combination of happiness and distress that becomes conspicuous by an absence of any sense of them. In this condition, a devotee falls to the ground, and the subsequent symptoms in the body ensue. These symptoms are mentioned above, and when they become prominent in the body, a state called //pralaya// (devastation) is manifest.
