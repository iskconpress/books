~~Title:Cc. Madhya 10: The Lord’s Return to Jagannātha Purī~~

====== The Lord’s Return to Jagannātha Purī ======

While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was traveling in South India, Sārvabhauma the Bhaṭṭācārya had many talks with King Pratāparudra. When Mahārāja Pratāparudra requested the Bhaṭṭācārya to arrange an interview with the Lord, the Bhaṭṭācārya assured him that he would try to do so as soon as Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned from South India. When the Lord returned to Jagannātha Purī from His South Indian tour, He lived at the home of Kāśī Miśra. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya introduced many Vaiṣṇavas to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu after His return. The father of Rāmānanda Rāya, Bhavānanda Rāya, offered another son named Vāṇīnātha Paṭṭanāyaka for the Lord's service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed His associates about the pollution of Kṛṣṇadāsa brought about by his association with the Bhaṭṭathāris, and thus the Lord proposed to give him leave. Nityānanda Prabhu sent Kṛṣṇadāsa to Bengal to inform the Navadvīpa devotees about the Lord's return to Jagannātha Purī. All the devotees of Navadvīpa thus began arranging to come to Jagannātha Purī. At this time Paramānanda Purī was at Navadvīpa, and immediately upon hearing news of the Lord's return, he started for Jagannātha Purī accompanied by a //brāhmaṇa// named Kamalākānta. Puruṣottama Bhaṭṭācārya, a resident of Navadvīpa, was educated at Vārāṇasī. He accepted the renounced order from Caitanyānanda, but he took the name of Svarūpa. Thus he arrived at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. After the demise of Śrī Īśvara Purī, his disciple Govinda, following his instructions, went to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Due to his relationship with Keśava Bhāratī, Brahmānanda Bhāratī was also respectfully received by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When he arrived at Jagannātha Purī, he was advised to give up the deerskin clothing he wore. When Brahmānanda understood Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu correctly, he accepted Him as Kṛṣṇa himself. However, when Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya addressed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Kṛṣṇa, the Lord immediately protested. In the meantime, Kāśīśvara Gosvāmī also came to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In this chapter, devotees from many different areas come to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and they are exactly like many rivers that come from many places to finally flow into the sea.

  ; [[.10:1|Cc. Madhya 10.1]]
  : I offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is compared to a cloud that pours water on fields of grain, which are like devotees suffering due to a shortage of rain. Separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is like a drought, but when the Lord returns, His presence is like a nectarean rain that falls on all the grains and saves them from perishing.

  ; [[.10:2|Cc. Madhya 10.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya All glories to Nityānanda! All glories to Advaitacandra! And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.10:3|Cc. Madhya 10.3]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu departed for South India, King Pratāparudra called Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya to his palace.

  ; [[.10:4|Cc. Madhya 10.4]]
  : When Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya met with the King, the King offered him a seat with all respects and inquired about news of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:5|Cc. Madhya 10.5]]
  : The King said to the Bhaṭṭācārya, "I have heard that a great personality has come from Bengal and is staying at your home. I have also heard that He is very, very merciful.

  ; [[.10:6|Cc. Madhya 10.6]]
  : "I have also heard that this great personality has shown you great favor. At any rate, this is what I hear from many different people. Now, being merciful upon me, you should do me the favor of arranging an interview."

  ; [[.10:7|Cc. Madhya 10.7]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "All that you have heard is true, but as far as an interview is concerned, it is very difficult to arrange.

  ; [[.10:8|Cc. Madhya 10.8]]
  : "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is in the renounced order and is very much detached from worldly affairs. He stays in solitary places, and even in dreams He does not grant interviews to a king.

  ; [[.10:9|Cc. Madhya 10.9]]
  : "Still, I would have tried to arrange your interview, but He has recently left to tour South India."

  ; [[.10:10|Cc. Madhya 10.10]]
  : The King asked, "Why has He left Jagannātha Purī?"
The Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "Such are the pastimes of a great personality.

  ; [[.10:11|Cc. Madhya 10.11]]
  : "Great saints go to holy places of pilgrimage in order to purify them. For that reason Caitanya Mahāprabhu is visiting many tīrthas and delivering many, many conditioned souls.

  ; [[.10:12|Cc. Madhya 10.12]]
  : " 'Saints of your caliber are themselves places of pilgrimage. Because of their purity, they are constant companions of the Lord, and therefore they can purify even the places of pilgrimage.'

  ; [[.10:13|Cc. Madhya 10.13]]
  : "A Vaiṣṇava travels to places of pilgrimage to purify them and reclaim fallen conditioned souls. This is one of the duties of a Vaiṣṇava. Actually, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not a living entity but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Consequently, He is a fully independent controller, yet in His position as a devotee, He carries out the activities of a devotee."

  ; [[.10:14|Cc. Madhya 10.14]]
  : Upon hearing this, the King replied, "Why did you allow Him to leave? Why didn't you fall at His lotus feet and keep Him here?"

  ; [[.10:15|Cc. Madhya 10.15]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself and is completely independent. Being Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, He is not dependent on anyone.

  ; [[.10:16|Cc. Madhya 10.16]]
  : "Still, I endeavored very hard to keep Him here, but because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and completely independent, I was not successful."

  ; [[.10:17|Cc. Madhya 10.17]]
  : The King said, "Bhaṭṭācārya, you are the most learned and experienced person I know. Therefore when you address Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Lord Kṛṣṇa, I accept this as the truth.

  ; [[.10:18|Cc. Madhya 10.18]]
  : "When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returns again, I wish to see Him just once in order to make my eyes perfect."

  ; [[.10:19|Cc. Madhya 10.19]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "His Holiness Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will return very soon. I wish to have a nice place ready for Him, a place solitary and peaceful.

  ; [[.10:20|Cc. Madhya 10.20]]
  : "Lord Caitanya's residence should be very much secluded and also near the temple of Jagannātha. Please consider this proposal and give me a nice place for Him."

  ; [[.10:21|Cc. Madhya 10.21]]
  : The King replied, "Kāśī Miśra's house is exactly what you require. It is near the temple and is very much secluded, calm and quiet."

  ; [[.10:22|Cc. Madhya 10.22]]
  : After saying this, the King became very anxious for the Lord to return. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then went to Kāśī Miśra to convey the King's desire.

  ; [[.10:23|Cc. Madhya 10.23]]
  : When Kāśī Miśra heard the proposal, he said, "I am very fortunate that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord of all prabhus, will stay at my home."

  ; [[.10:24|Cc. Madhya 10.24]]
  : Thus all the residents of Jagannātha Purī, which is also known as Puruṣottama, became anxious to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again.

  ; [[.10:25|Cc. Madhya 10.25]]
  : When all the residents of Jagannātha Purī became extremely anxious to meet the Lord again, He returned from South India.

  ; [[.10:26|Cc. Madhya 10.26]]
  : Hearing of the Lord's return, everyone became very happy, and they all went to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and spoke to him as follows.

  ; [[.10:27|Cc. Madhya 10.27]]
  : "Please arrange our meeting with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is only by your mercy that we can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord."

  ; [[.10:28|Cc. Madhya 10.28]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya replied to the people, "Tomorrow the Lord will be at the house of Kāśī Miśra. I shall arrange for you all to meet Him."

  ; [[.10:29|Cc. Madhya 10.29]]
  : The next day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived and went with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, with great enthusiasm, to see the temple of Lord Jagannātha.

  ; [[.10:30|Cc. Madhya 10.30]]
  : All the servants of Lord Jagannātha delivered remnants of the Lord's food to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In return, Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced them all.

  ; [[.10:31|Cc. Madhya 10.31]]
  : After seeing Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left the temple. The Bhaṭṭācārya then took Him to the house of Kāśī Miśra.

  ; [[.10:32|Cc. Madhya 10.32]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at his house, Kāśī Miśra immediately fell down at His lotus feet and surrendered himself and all his possessions.

  ; [[.10:33|Cc. Madhya 10.33]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then showed Kāśī Miśra His four-armed form. Then, accepting him for His service, the Lord embraced him.

  ; [[.10:34|Cc. Madhya 10.34]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next sat down at the place prepared for Him, and all the devotees, headed by Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, surrounded Him.

  ; [[.10:35|Cc. Madhya 10.35]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very happy to see His residential quarters, in which all His necessities were taken care of.

  ; [[.10:36|Cc. Madhya 10.36]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "This place is just befitting You. Please accept it. It is the hope of Kāśī Miśra that You do."

  ; [[.10:37|Cc. Madhya 10.37]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My body belongs to all of you. Therefore I agree to whatever you say."

  ; [[.10:38|Cc. Madhya 10.38]]
  : After this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, sitting at the right hand of the Lord, began to introduce all the inhabitants of Puruṣottama, Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.10:39|Cc. Madhya 10.39]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya said, "My dear Lord, all these people who are residents of Nīlācala, Jagannātha Purī, have been very anxious to meet You.

  ; [[.10:40|Cc. Madhya 10.40]]
  : "In Your absence all these people have been exactly like thirsty cātaka birds crying in disappointment. Kindly accept them."

  ; [[.10:41|Cc. Madhya 10.41]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya first introduced Janārdana, saying, "Here is Janārdana, servant of Lord Jagannātha. He renders service to the Lord when it is time to renovate His transcendental body."

  ; [[.10:42|Cc. Madhya 10.42]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "This is Kṛṣṇadāsa, who carries a golden cane, and here is Śikhi Māhiti, who is in charge of writing.

  ; [[.10:43|Cc. Madhya 10.43]]
  : "This is Pradyumna Miśra, who is chief of all Vaiṣṇavas. He is a great servitor of Jagannātha, and his name is Dāsa.

  ; [[.10:44|Cc. Madhya 10.44]]
  : "This is Murāri Māhiti, the brother of Śikhi Māhiti. He has nothing other than Your lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:45|Cc. Madhya 10.45]]
  : "Here are Candaneśvara, Siṁheśvara, Murāri Brāhmaṇa and Viṣṇudāsa. They are all constantly engaged in meditating on Your lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:46|Cc. Madhya 10.46]]
  : "This is Paramānanda Prahararāja, who is also known as Mahāpātra. He is very, very intelligent.

  ; [[.10:47|Cc. Madhya 10.47]]
  : "All these pure devotees serve as ornaments to Jagannātha Purī. They are always undeviatingly meditating upon Your lotus feet."

  ; [[.10:48|Cc. Madhya 10.48]]
  : After this introduction, everyone fell to the ground like rods. Being very merciful upon them all, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced each one of them.

  ; [[.10:49|Cc. Madhya 10.49]]
  : At this time Bhavānanda Rāya appeared with four of his sons, and all of them fell down at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:50|Cc. Madhya 10.50]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "This is Bhavānanda Rāya, the father of Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, who is his first son."

  ; [[.10:51|Cc. Madhya 10.51]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Bhavānanda Rāya and with great respect spoke of his son Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.10:52|Cc. Madhya 10.52]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu honored Bhavānanda Rāya by saying, "The glories of a person who has a jewel of a son like Rāmānanda Rāya cannot be described within this mortal world.

  ; [[.10:53|Cc. Madhya 10.53]]
  : "You are Mahārāja Pāṇḍu himself, and your wife is Kuntīdevī herself. All your highly intellectual sons are representatives of the five Pāṇḍavas."

  ; [[.10:54|Cc. Madhya 10.54]]
  : After hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's praise, Bhavānanda Rāya submitted, "I am in the fourth class of the social order, and I engage in mundane affairs. Although I am very much fallen, You have still touched me. This is proof that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

  ; [[.10:55|Cc. Madhya 10.55]]
  : Appreciating Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's favor, Bhavānanda Rāya also said, "Along with my home, riches, servants and five sons, I surrender myself at Your lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:56|Cc. Madhya 10.56]]
  : "This son Vāṇīnātha will remain at Your lotus feet to always immediately attend to Your orders and serve You.

  ; [[.10:57|Cc. Madhya 10.57]]
  : "My dear Lord, please consider me Your relative. Do not hesitate to order whatever You desire at any time You desire it."

  ; [[.10:58|Cc. Madhya 10.58]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted Bhavānanda Rāya's offer, saying, "I accept without hesitation because you are not an outsider. Birth after birth you have been My servant along with your family members.

  ; [[.10:59|Cc. Madhya 10.59]]
  : "Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya is coming within five to seven days. As soon as he arrives, My desires will be fulfilled. I take great pleasure in his company."

  ; [[.10:60|Cc. Madhya 10.60]]
  : Saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Bhavānanda Rāya. The Lord then touched the heads of his sons with His lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:61|Cc. Madhya 10.61]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then sent Bhavānanda Rāya back to his home, and He kept only Vāṇīnātha Paṭṭanāyaka in His personal service.

  ; [[.10:62|Cc. Madhya 10.62]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then asked all the people to leave. Afterward, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu called for Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa, who had accompanied the Lord during His South Indian tour.

  ; [[.10:63|Cc. Madhya 10.63]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, just consider this man's character. He went with Me to South India.

  ; [[.10:64|Cc. Madhya 10.64]]
  : "He left My company to associate with the Bhaṭṭathāris, but I rescued him from their company and brought him here.

  ; [[.10:65|Cc. Madhya 10.65]]
  : "Now that I have brought him here, I am asking him to leave. Now he can go wherever he likes, for I am no longer responsible for him."

  ; [[.10:66|Cc. Madhya 10.66]]
  : Hearing the Lord reject him, Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa began to cry. However, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, not caring for him, immediately left to take His noon lunch.

  ; [[.10:67|Cc. Madhya 10.67]]
  : After this, the other devotees-headed by Nityānanda Prabhu, Jagadānanda, Mukunda and Dāmodara-began to consider a certain plan.

  ; [[.10:68|Cc. Madhya 10.68]]
  : The Lord's four devotees considered, "We want a person to go to Bengal just to inform Śacīmātā about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's arrival at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.10:69|Cc. Madhya 10.69]]
  : "After hearing news of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's arrival, devotees like Advaita and Śrīvāsa will certainly come to see Him.

  ; [[.10:70|Cc. Madhya 10.70]]
  : "Let us therefore send Kṛṣṇadāsa to Bengal." Saying this, they kept Kṛṣṇadāsa engaged in the service of the Lord and gave him assurance.

  ; [[.10:71|Cc. Madhya 10.71]]
  : The next day, all the devotees asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Please give permission for a person to go to Bengal.

  ; [[.10:72|Cc. Madhya 10.72]]
  : "Mother Śacī and all the devotees headed by Advaita Prabhu are all very unhappy due to not receiving news about Your return from Your South Indian tour.

  ; [[.10:73|Cc. Madhya 10.73]]
  : "One person should go to Bengal and inform them about the auspicious news of Your return to Jagannātha Purī."
Upon hearing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Do whatever you decide."

  ; [[.10:74|Cc. Madhya 10.74]]
  : In this way Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa was sent to Bengal, and he was given sufficient quantities of Lord Jagannātha's food remnants to distribute there.

  ; [[.10:75|Cc. Madhya 10.75]]
  : Thus Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa went to Bengal, and he first went to Navadvīpa to see mother Śacī.

  ; [[.10:76|Cc. Madhya 10.76]]
  : Upon reaching mother Śacī, Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa first offered his obeisances and delivered the food remnants [mahā-prasāda]. He then informed her of the good news that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had returned from His South Indian tour.

  ; [[.10:77|Cc. Madhya 10.77]]
  : This good news gave much pleasure to mother Śacī, as well as to all the devotees of Navadvīpa, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura.

  ; [[.10:78|Cc. Madhya 10.78]]
  : Hearing of Lord Caitanya's return to Purī, everyone became very glad. Kṛṣṇadāsa next went to the house of Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.10:79|Cc. Madhya 10.79]]
  : After paying Him respectful obeisances, Kṛṣṇadāsa offered mahā-prasāda to Advaita Ācārya. He then informed Him of the news of Lord Caitanya in complete detail.

  ; [[.10:80|Cc. Madhya 10.80]]
  : When Advaita Ācārya Gosvāmī heard of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's return, He became very much pleased. In His great ecstasy of love, He made a rumbling sound and danced and chanted for a long time.

  ; [[.10:81|Cc. Madhya 10.81]]
  : Also hearing this auspicious news, Haridāsa Ṭhākura became very much pleased. So also did Vāsudeva Datta, Murāri Gupta and Śivānanda Sena.

  ; [[.10:88|Cc. Madhya 10.88]]
  : All the devotees met together at Navadvīpa and, with mother Śacī's permission, departed for Nīlādri, Jagannātha Purī.

  : Mukunda, Narahari, Raghunandana and all the others came from Khaṇḍa to Advaita Ācārya's home to accompany Him to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.10:91|Cc. Madhya 10.91]]
  : At that time Paramānanda Purī came from South India. Traveling along the banks of the Ganges, he ultimately reached the town of Nadia.

  ; [[.10:92|Cc. Madhya 10.92]]
  : At Navadvīpa, Paramānanda Purī took his board and lodging at the house of Śacīmātā. She provided him with everything very respectfully.

  : While residing at the house of Śacīmātā, Paramānanda Purī heard the news of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's return to Jagannātha Purī. He therefore decided to go there as soon as possible.

  ; [[.10:94|Cc. Madhya 10.94]]
  : There was a devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's named Dvija Kamalākānta, whom Paramānanda Purī took with him to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.10:95|Cc. Madhya 10.95]]

  ; [[.10:101|Cc. Madhya 10.101]]
  : There was a solitary room at Kāśī Miśra's house, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave it to Paramānanda Purī. He also gave him one servant.

  ; [[.10:102|Cc. Madhya 10.102]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara also arrived the next day. He was a very intimate friend of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he was an ocean of transcendental mellows.

  ; [[.10:103|Cc. Madhya 10.103]]
  : When Svarūpa Dāmodara was residing at Navadvīpa under the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, his name was Puruṣottama Ācārya.

  ; [[.10:104|Cc. Madhya 10.104]]
  : After seeing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the renounced order, Puruṣottama Ācārya became like a madman and immediately went to Vārāṇasī to take sannyāsa.

  ; [[.10:105|Cc. Madhya 10.105]]
  : At the conclusion of his sannyāsa, his spiritual master, Caitanyānanda Bhāratī, ordered him, "Read Vedānta-sūtra and teach it to all others."

  ; [[.10:106|Cc. Madhya 10.106]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara was a great renunciant as well as a great learned scholar. With heart and soul he took shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.10:107|Cc. Madhya 10.107]]
  : He was very enthusiastic to worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa without disturbance, and therefore, almost in madness, he accepted the sannyāsa order.

  ; [[.10:108|Cc. Madhya 10.108]]
  : Upon accepting sannyāsa, Puruṣottama Ācārya followed the regulative principles by giving up his tuft of hair and sacred thread, but he did not accept the saffron-colored dress. Also, he did not accept a sannyāsī title but remained as a naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī.

  ; [[.10:109|Cc. Madhya 10.109]]
  : After taking permission from his sannyāsa-guru, Svarūpa Dāmodara went to Nīlācala and accepted the shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then all day and night, in ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa, he enjoyed transcendental mellows in the loving service of the Lord.

  ; [[.10:110|Cc. Madhya 10.110]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara was the limit of all learned scholarship, but he did not exchange words with anyone. He simply remained in a solitary place, and no one could understand where he was.

  ; [[.10:111|Cc. Madhya 10.111]]
  : Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara was the personification of ecstatic love, fully cognizant of the transcendental mellows in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. He directly represented Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as His second expansion.

  ; [[.10:112|Cc. Madhya 10.112]]
  : If someone wrote a book or composed verses and songs and wanted to recite them before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Svarūpa Dāmodara would first examine them and then correctly present them. Only then would Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu agree to listen.

  ; [[.10:113|Cc. Madhya 10.113]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was never pleased to hear books or verses opposed to the conclusive statements of devotional service. The Lord did not like hearing rasābhāsa, the overlapping of transcendental mellows.

  ; [[.10:114|Cc. Madhya 10.114]]
  : It was the practice of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī to examine all works of literature to find out whether their conclusions were correct. Only then would he allow them to be heard by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:115|Cc. Madhya 10.115]]
  : Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara used to read the poems of Vidyāpati and Caṇḍīdāsa and Jayadeva Gosvāmī's Śrī Gīta-govinda. He used to make Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very happy by singing these songs.

  ; [[.10:116|Cc. Madhya 10.116]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara was as expert a musician as the Gandharvas, and in scriptural discussion he was just like Bṛhaspati, the priest of the heavenly gods. Therefore it is to be concluded that there was no great personality quite like Svarūpa Dāmodara.

  ; [[.10:117|Cc. Madhya 10.117]]
  : Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara was very dear to Advaita Ācārya and Nityānanda Prabhu, and he was the life and soul of all the devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura.

  ; [[.10:118|Cc. Madhya 10.118]]
  : When Svarūpa Dāmodara came to Jagannātha Purī, he fell flat before the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, offering Him obeisances and reciting a verse.

  ; [[.10:119|Cc. Madhya 10.119]]
  : "O ocean of mercy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! Let there be an awakening of Your auspicious mercy, which easily drives away all kinds of material lamentation. By Your mercy, everything is made pure and blissful. It awakens transcendental bliss and covers all material pleasures. By Your auspicious mercy, quarrels and disagreements arising among different scriptures are vanquished. Your auspicious mercy causes the heart to jubilate by pouring forth transcendental mellows. Your mercy always stimulates devotional service, which is full of joy. You are always glorifying the conjugal love of God. May transcendental bliss be awakened within my heart by Your causeless mercy."

  ; [[.10:120|Cc. Madhya 10.120]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu raised Svarūpa Dāmodara to his feet and embraced him. They both became ecstatic in love and fell unconscious.

  ; [[.10:121|Cc. Madhya 10.121]]
  : After they had regained their patience, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to speak.

  ; [[.10:122|Cc. Madhya 10.122]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I saw in a dream that you were coming, and so this is very auspicious. I have been like a blind man, but your coming here restores My vision."

  ; [[.10:123|Cc. Madhya 10.123]]
  : Svarūpa said, "My dear Lord, please excuse my offense. I gave up Your company to go elsewhere, and that was my great mistake.

  ; [[.10:124|Cc. Madhya 10.124]]
  : "My dear Lord, I do not even possess a trace of love at Your lotus feet. If I did, how could I go to another country? I am therefore a most sinful man.

  ; [[.10:125|Cc. Madhya 10.125]]
  : "I gave up Your company, but You did not give me up. By Your rope of mercy You have bound me by the neck and brought me back again to Your lotus feet."

  ; [[.10:126|Cc. Madhya 10.126]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara then worshiped the lotus feet of Nityānanda Prabhu, and Nityānanda in turn embraced him in the ecstasy of love.

  ; [[.10:127|Cc. Madhya 10.127]]
  : After worshiping Nityānanda Prabhu, Svarūpa Dāmodara met Jagadānanda, Mukunda, Śaṅkara and Sārvabhauma, as was befitting.

  ; [[.10:128|Cc. Madhya 10.128]]
  : Svarūpa Dāmodara also offered his worshipful prayers at the lotus feet of Paramānanda Purī, who, in return, embraced him in ecstatic love.

  ; [[.10:129|Cc. Madhya 10.129]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then gave Svarūpa Dāmodara residence in a solitary place and ordered a servant to serve him with a supply of water and other necessities.

  ; [[.10:130|Cc. Madhya 10.130]]
  : The next day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat with all the devotees, headed by Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, and they discussed the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.10:131|Cc. Madhya 10.131]]
  : At that time Govinda appeared on the scene, offered his respectful obeisances and spoke submissively.

  ; [[.10:132|Cc. Madhya 10.132]]
  : "I am the servant of Īśvara Purī. My name is Govinda, and following the orders of my spiritual master, I have come here.

  ; [[.10:133|Cc. Madhya 10.133]]
  : "Just before his departure from this mortal world to attain the highest perfection, Īśvara Purī told me that I should go to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and render service unto Him.

  ; [[.10:134|Cc. Madhya 10.134]]
  : "Kāśīśvara will also come here after visiting all the holy places. However, following the orders of my spiritual master, I have hastily come to be present at Your lotus feet."

  ; [[.10:135|Cc. Madhya 10.135]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "My spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, always favors Me with paternal affection. Therefore, out of his causeless mercy, he has sent you here."

  ; [[.10:136|Cc. Madhya 10.136]]
  : After hearing this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Why did Īśvara Purī keep a servant who comes from a śūdra family?"

  ; [[.10:137|Cc. Madhya 10.137]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and My spiritual master, Īśvara Purī, are completely independent. Therefore neither the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead nor that of Īśvara Purī is subject to any Vedic rules or regulations.

  ; [[.10:138|Cc. Madhya 10.138]]
  : "The mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not restricted to the jurisdiction of caste and creed. Vidura was a śūdra, yet Kṛṣṇa accepted lunch at his home.

  ; [[.10:139|Cc. Madhya 10.139]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa's mercy is dependent only on affection. Being obliged only by affection, Lord Kṛṣṇa acts very independently.

  ; [[.10:140|Cc. Madhya 10.140]]
  : "In conclusion, dealings in affection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead bring happiness many millions of times greater than dealings with Him in awe and veneration. Simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord, the devotee is merged in transcendental bliss."

  ; [[.10:141|Cc. Madhya 10.141]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Govinda, and Govinda in turn offered his respectful obeisances unto Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:142|Cc. Madhya 10.142]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then continued speaking to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya: "Consider this point. The servant of the spiritual master is always respectable for Me.

  ; [[.10:143|Cc. Madhya 10.143]]
  : "As such, it is not befitting that the guru's servant should engage in My personal service. Yet My spiritual master has given this order. What shall I do?"

  ; [[.10:144|Cc. Madhya 10.144]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "The order of the spiritual master is very strong and cannot be disobeyed. That is the injunction of the śāstras, the revealed scriptures.

  ; [[.10:145|Cc. Madhya 10.145]]
  : " 'Being ordered by his father, Paraśurāma killed his mother, Reṇukā, just as if she were an enemy. When Lakṣmaṇa, the younger brother of Lord Rāmacandra, heard of this, He immediately engaged Himself in the service of His elder brother and accepted His orders. The order of the spiritual master must be obeyed without consideration.'

  ; [[.10:146|Cc. Madhya 10.146]]
  : " 'The order of a great personality like a father must be executed without consideration because there is good fortune in such an order for both of us. In particular, there is good fortune for Me.' "

  ; [[.10:147|Cc. Madhya 10.147]]
  : After Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Govinda and engaged him in the service of His personal body.

  ; [[.10:148|Cc. Madhya 10.148]]
  : Everyone respected Govinda as the dearest servant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Govinda served all the Vaiṣṇavas and saw to their needs.

  ; [[.10:149|Cc. Madhya 10.149]]
  : Both Haridāsa senior and Haridāsa junior, who were musicians, as well as Rāmāi and Nandāi, used to stay with Govinda.

  ; [[.10:150|Cc. Madhya 10.150]]
  : They all remained with Govinda to serve Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore no one could estimate the good fortune of Govinda.

  ; [[.10:151|Cc. Madhya 10.151]]
  : The next day Mukunda Datta informed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Brahmānanda Bhāratī has come to see You."

  ; [[.10:152|Cc. Madhya 10.152]]
  : Mukunda Datta then asked the Lord, "Shall I bring him here?"
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Brahmānanda Bhāratī is like My spiritual master. It is better that I go to him."

  ; [[.10:153|Cc. Madhya 10.153]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees came into the presence of Brahmānanda Bhāratī.

  ; [[.10:154|Cc. Madhya 10.154]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees approached him, they saw that he was covered with a deerskin. Seeing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very unhappy.

  ; [[.10:155|Cc. Madhya 10.155]]
  : Seeing Brahmānanda Bhāratī wearing the deerskin, Caitanya Mahāprabhu pretended not to see him. Instead, He asked Mukunda Datta, "Where is Brahmānanda Bhāratī, My spiritual master?"

  ; [[.10:156|Cc. Madhya 10.156]]
  : Mukunda Datta replied, "Here is Brahmānanda Bhāratī, in Your presence."
The Lord replied, "You are incorrect. This is not Brahmānanda Bhāratī.

  ; [[.10:157|Cc. Madhya 10.157]]
  : "You must be talking of someone else, for this is surely not Brahmānanda Bhāratī. You simply have no knowledge. Why should Brahmānanda Bhāratī wear a deerskin?"

  ; [[.10:158|Cc. Madhya 10.158]]
  : When Brahmānanda Bhāratī heard this, he thought, "My deerskin is not approved by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu."

  ; [[.10:159|Cc. Madhya 10.159]]
  : Thus admitting his mistake, Brahmānanda Bhāratī thought, "He spoke well. I put on this deerskin only for prestige. I cannot cross over the ocean of nescience simply by wearing a deerskin.

  ; [[.10:160|Cc. Madhya 10.160]]
  : "From today on I shall not wear this deerskin." As soon as Brahmānanda Bhāratī decided this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, understanding his mind, immediately sent for the robes of a sannyāsī.

  ; [[.10:161|Cc. Madhya 10.161]]
  : As soon as Brahmānanda Bhāratī gave up his deerskin and covered himself with sannyāsī robes, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came and offered His respects at his lotus feet.

  ; [[.10:162|Cc. Madhya 10.162]]
  : Brahmānanda Bhāratī said, "You instruct the general populace by Your behavior. I will not do anything against Your wishes; otherwise You will not offer me respects but will neglect me. I am afraid of this.

  ; [[.10:163|Cc. Madhya 10.163]]
  : "At the present moment I see two Brahmans. One Brahman is Lord Jagannātha, who does not move, and the other Brahman, who is moving, is You. Lord Jagannātha is the arcā-vigraha, the worshipable Deity, and it is He who is the nonmoving Brahman. But You are Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and You are moving here and there. The two of You are the same Brahman, master of the material nature, but You are playing two parts-one moving and one not moving. In this way two Brahmans are now residing at Jagannātha Purī, Puruṣottama.

  ; [[.10:164|Cc. Madhya 10.164]]
  : "Of the two Brahmans, You are fair-complexioned, and the other, Lord Jagannātha, is blackish. Both of You are delivering the whole world."

  ; [[.10:165|Cc. Madhya 10.165]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Actually, to tell you the truth, due to your presence there are now two Brahmans at Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.10:166|Cc. Madhya 10.166]]
  : "Both Brahmānanda and Gaurahari are moving, whereas the blackish Lord Jagannātha is sitting tight and immobile."

  ; [[.10:167|Cc. Madhya 10.167]]
  : Brahmānanda Bhāratī said, "My dear Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, please become the mediator in this logical argument between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and me."

  ; [[.10:168|Cc. Madhya 10.168]]
  : Brahmānanda Bhāratī continued, "The living entity is localized, whereas the Supreme Brahman is all-pervading. That is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.

  ; [[.10:169|Cc. Madhya 10.169]]
  : "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu purified me by taking away my deerskin. This is proof that He is all-pervasive and all-powerful and that I am subordinate to Him.

  ; [[.10:170|Cc. Madhya 10.170]]
  : " 'His bodily hue is golden, and His whole body is like molten gold. Every part of His body is very beautifully constructed and smeared with sandalwood pulp. Accepting the renounced order, the Lord is always equipoised. He is firmly fixed in His mission of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, and He is firmly situated in His dualistic conclusion and in His peace.'

  ; [[.10:171|Cc. Madhya 10.171]]
  : "All the symptoms mentioned in the verse from the Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-stotra are visible in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His arms are decorated with sandalwood pulp and the thread received from the Śrī Jagannātha Deity, and these are His ornamental bangles."

  ; [[.10:172|Cc. Madhya 10.172]]
  : After hearing this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya rendered his judgment, saying, "Brahmānanda Bhāratī, I see that you are victorious."
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately said, "I accept whatever Brahmānanda Bhāratī has said. It is quite all right with Me."

  ; [[.10:173|Cc. Madhya 10.173]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus posed Himself as a disciple and accepted Brahmānanda Bhāratī as His spiritual master. He then said, "The disciple is certainly defeated in an argument with the spiritual master."
Brahmānanda Bhāratī immediately countered these words, saying, "This is not the cause of Your defeat. There is another cause.

  ; [[.10:174|Cc. Madhya 10.174]]
  : "It is Your natural characteristic to accept defeat at the hands of Your devotee. There is also another glory of Yours, which I ask You to hear attentively.

  ; [[.10:175|Cc. Madhya 10.175]]
  : "I have been meditating on the impersonal Brahman since my birth, but since I have seen You, I have fully experienced Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.10:176|Cc. Madhya 10.176]]
  : Brahmānanda Bhāratī continued, "Since I have seen You, I have been feeling Lord Kṛṣṇa's presence in my mind and have been seeing Him before my eyes. I now want to chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Over and above this, within my heart I consider You to be Kṛṣṇa, and I am therefore very eager to serve You.

  ; [[.10:177|Cc. Madhya 10.177]]
  : "Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura abandoned his impersonal realization for the realization of the Personality of Godhead. I now see that my condition is similar to his, for it has already changed."

  ; [[.10:178|Cc. Madhya 10.178]]
  : Brahmānanda Bhāratī concluded, " 'Although I was worshiped by those on the path of monism and initiated into self-realization through the yoga system, I have nonetheless been forcibly turned into a maidservant by some cunning boy who is always joking with the gopīs.' "

  ; [[.10:179|Cc. Madhya 10.179]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "You have a deep ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa; therefore wherever you turn your eyes, you simply heighten your Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

  ; [[.10:180|Cc. Madhya 10.180]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "The statements of both of you are correct. Kṛṣṇa gives direct audience through His own mercy.

  ; [[.10:181|Cc. Madhya 10.181]]
  : "Without having ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, one cannot see Him directly. Therefore through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Brahmānanda Bhāratī has acquired direct vision of the Lord."

  ; [[.10:182|Cc. Madhya 10.182]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, what are you saying? Lord Viṣṇu, save Me! Such glorification is simply another form of blasphemy."

  ; [[.10:183|Cc. Madhya 10.183]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took Brahmānanda Bhāratī with Him to His residence. From that time on, Brahmānanda Bhāratī remained with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.10:184|Cc. Madhya 10.184]]
  : Later, Rāmabhadra Ācārya and Bhagavān Ācārya also joined them and, giving up all other responsibilities, remained under Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's shelter.

  ; [[.10:185|Cc. Madhya 10.185]]
  : The next day, Kāśīśvara Gosāñi also came and remained with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who received him with great respect.

  ; [[.10:186|Cc. Madhya 10.186]]
  : Kāśīśvara used to usher Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Jagannātha temple. He would precede the Lord into the crowd and keep the people from touching Him.

  ; [[.10:187|Cc. Madhya 10.187]]
  : As all the rivers flow into the sea, all the devotees throughout the country finally came to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's shelter.

  ; [[.10:188|Cc. Madhya 10.188]]
  : Since all the devotees came to Him for shelter, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed them all mercy and kept them under His protection.

  ; [[.10:189|Cc. Madhya 10.189]]
  : Thus I have described the meeting of all the Vaiṣṇavas with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Whoever hears this description ultimately attains His shelter.

  ; [[.10:190|Cc. Madhya 10.190]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
