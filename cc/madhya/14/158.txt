===== Purport =====

This verse is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.33.25). The //gopīs// are all transcendental spirit souls. One should never think that the //gopīs// and Kṛṣṇa have material bodies. Vṛndāvana-dhāma is also a spiritual abode, and there the days and nights, the trees, flowers, water and everything else are spiritual. There is not even a trace of material contamination. Kṛṣṇa, who is the Supreme Brahman and Supersoul, is not at all interested in anything material. His activities with the //gopīs// are all spiritual and take place within the spiritual world. They have nothing to do with the material world. Lord Kṛṣṇa's lusty desires and ail His dealings with the //gopīs// are on the spiritual platform. One has to be transcendentally realized before even considering relishing the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the //gopīs.// One who is on the mundane platform must first purify himself by following the regulative principles. Only then can he try to understand Kṛṣṇa and the //gopīs.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī are here talking about the relationship between Kṛṣṇa and the //gopīs:// therefore the subject matter is neither mundane nor erotic. Being a //sannyāsī,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict in His dealings with women. Unless the //gopīs// were on the spiritual platform, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would have never even mentioned them to Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī. Therefore these descriptions do not at all pertain to material activity.
