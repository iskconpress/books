===== Purport =====

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has pointed out that this //vṛndāvana-vihāra//---the pastimes of Vṛndāvana-does not refer to Kṛṣṇa's mixing with the //gopīs// or the transcendental mellow of //parakīya-rasa.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //vṛndāvana-līlā// in the garden of Jagannātha Purī did not involve association with women or with other people's wives in the fashion transcendentally demonstrated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In His //vṛndāvana-līlā,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu conceived of Himself as the assistant of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī enjoyed the company of Kṛṣṇa, Her maidservants were very pleased. One should not compare Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //vṛndāvana-vihāra// in the garden of Jagannātha with the activities of the //gaurāṅga-nāgarīs.//
