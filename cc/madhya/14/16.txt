Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy is so powerful that it acts automatically. If a person renders loving service to Kṛṣṇa, it never goes in vain. It is recorded in a spiritual account, and in due time it will fructify. This is confirmed by the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:40|(Bg. 2.40)]]. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt:// "In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear."

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has particularly bestowed upon all fallen souls in this age the most potent method of devotional service, and whoever takes to it through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is immediately elevated to the transcendental position. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// recommends: //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// (//Bhāg.// 11.5.32).

A student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must receive Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy; then his devotional service will quickly succeed. This was the case with King Pratāparudra. One has to be noticed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and a little service with sincere efforts will convince the Lord that one is a proper candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. Mahārāja Pratāparudra did not have a chance to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but when the Lord saw that the King was serving Lord Jagannātha as a menial sweeper, the Lord's mercy upon the King became a solid fact. When Mahārāja Pratāparudra, in the dress of a Vaiṣṇava, was serving the Lord, the Lord did not even inquire who he was. Rather, He had compassion upon him and began to embrace him.

Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī wants to point out that nothing could compare to the Lord's mercy toward Mahārāja Pratāparudra; therefore he uses the word //dekha// ("just see") and //caitanyera kṛpā-mahābala// ("how powerful is the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu"). This is also confirmed by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī: //yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhava-vatām// (//Caitanya-candrāmṛta// 5). Even a little of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy serves as a great asset for spiritual advancement. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be spread through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When Rūpa Gosvāmī experienced the mercy and magnanimity of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he said:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ

"I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya who is more magnanimous than any other //avatāra,// even Kṛṣṇa Himself, because He is bestowing freely what no one else has ever given-pure love of Kṛṣṇa." Śrīla Locana dāsa Ṭhākura has also sung, //parama karuṇa, pahuṅ dui jana, nitāi-gaura-candra:// "The two brothers Nitāi and Gaura are so kind that no one can compare to them." Similarly, Śrīla Narottama dāsa ṭhākura has sung:

> vrajendra-nandana yei,     śacī-suta haila sei,
> balarāma haila nitāi,
> dīna-hīna yata chila,     hari-nāme uddhārila,
> tā'ra sākṣī jagāi-mādhāi

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's special mission is the deliverance of all fallen souls in Kali-yuga. Devotees of Kṛṣṇa must persistently seek the favor and mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to become fit to return home, back to Godhead.
