===== Purport =====

The left wing and right wing of the //gopīs// has been explained by Rūpa Gosvāmī in //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi.// The left wing is described in this way:

> mana-grahe sadodyuktā
> tac-chaithilye ca kopanā
> abhedyā nāyake prāyaḥ
> krūrā vāmeti kīrtyate

"A //gopī// who is always eager to be jealously angered, who is very enthusiastic for that position, who immediately becomes angry when defeated, who is never under the control of a hero and who always opposes Him is called //vāmā,// or a leftwing //gopī.//"

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī describes the right-wing //gopīs// in this way:

> asahyā māna-nirbandhe
> nāyake yukta-vādinī
> sāmabhis tena bhedyā ca
> dakṣiṇā parikīrtitā

"A //gopī// who cannot tolerate womanly anger, who speaks suitable words to the hero and who is satisfied by His sweet words is called a //dakṣiṇā,// or a right-wing //gopi."//
