{{description>" 'When Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī saw Lord Kṛṣṇa just before Her, Her progress stopped, and She assumed an attitude of opposition. Although Her face was slightly covered by a blue garment, Her two starry eyes were agitated, being wide and curved. Thus She was decorated with the ornaments of vilāsa, and Her beauty increased to give pleasure to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.'}}
