===== Purport =====

Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, a Vaiṣṇava should be fully satisfied simply to see a variety of food offered to the Deity of Jagannātha or Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. A Vaiṣṇava should not hunger for a variety of food for his own sake; rather, his satisfaction is in seeing various foods being offered to the Deity. In his //Gurv-aṣṭaka,// Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura writes:

> catur-vidha-śrī-bhagavat-prasāda-
> svādv-anna-tṛptān hari-bhakta-saṅghān
> kṛtvaiva tṛptiṁ bhajataḥ sadaiva
> vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam

"The spiritual master is always offering Kṛṣṇa four kinds of delicious food [analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk and sucked]. When the spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating //bhagavat-prasāda,// he is satisfied. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master."

The spiritual master's duty is to engage his disciples in preparing varieties of nice food to offer the Deity. After being offered, this food is distributed as //prasāda// to the devotees. These activities satisfy the spiritual master, although he himself does not eat or require such a variety of //prasāda.// By seeing to the offering and distribution of //prasāda,// he himself is encouraged in devotional service.
