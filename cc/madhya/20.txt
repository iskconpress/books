====== Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Instructs Sanātana Gosvāmī in the Science of the Absolute Truth ======

The following summary study of this chapter is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// When Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī was imprisoned by Nawab Hussain Shah, he received news from Rūpa Gosvāmī that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had gone to Mathurā. Sanātana Gosvāmī thereafter satisfied the superintendent of the jail by sweet solicitations and bribery. After giving the jailer seven thousand gold coins, Sanātana Gosvāmī was released. He then crossed the Ganges and fled. One of his servants, Īśāna, followed him, carrying eight gold coins. Sanātana Gosvāmī and his servant then spent the night in a small hotel on the way to Benares. The hotel owner knew that Sanātana Gosvāmī and his servant had eight gold coins, and he decided to kill them and take the money. Making plans in this way, the hotel owner received them as honorable guests. Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, asked his servant how much money he had, and, taking seven of the gold coins, Sanātana offered them to the hotel owner. Thus the owner helped them reach the hilly tract toward Vārāṇasī. On the way, Sanātana Gosvāmī met his brother-in-law, Śrīkānta, at Hājipura, and Śrīkānta helped him after he had heard about all Sanātana's troubles. Thus Sanātana Gosvāmī finally arrived at Vārāṇasī and stood before the door of Candraśekhara. Caitanya Mahāprabhu called him in and ordered him to change his dress so that he could look like a gentleman. For his garment, he used an old cloth of Tapana Miśra's. Later, he exchanged his valuable blanket for a torn quilt. At this time Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very pleased with him, and thus Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī received knowledge of the Absolute Truth from the Lord Himself.

First they discussed the constitutional position of the living entities, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī how the living entity is one of Lord Kṛṣṇa's energies. After this, the Lord explained the way of devotional service. While discussing the Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord analyzed Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, as well as the expansions of the Lord called //svayaṁ-rūpa, tad-ekātma// and //āveśa,// which are divided into various branches known as //vaibhava// and //prābhava.// Thus the Lord described the many forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also described the incarnations of God within the material world, incarnations such as the //puruṣa-avatāras, manvantara-avatāras, guṇa-avatāras// and //saktyāveśa-avatāras.// The Lord also discussed the divisions of Kṛṣṇa's different ages, such as //bālya// and //paugaṇḍa,// and the different pastimes of the different ages. He explained how Kṛṣṇa attained His permanent form when He reached youth. In this way Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained and described everything to Sanātana Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.20:1|Cc. Madhya 20.1]]
  : Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who has unlimited, wonderful opulences. By His mercy, even a person born as the lowest of men can spread the science of devotional service.

  ; [[.20:2|Cc. Madhya 20.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[.20:3|Cc. Madhya 20.3]]
  : While Sanātana Gosvāmī was imprisoned in Bengal, a letter arrived from Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.20:4|Cc. Madhya 20.4]]
  : When Sanātana Gosvāmī received this note from Rūpa Gosvāmī, he became very pleased. He immediately went to the jail superintendent, who was a meat-eater, and spoke as follows.

  ; [[.20:5|Cc. Madhya 20.5]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī told the Mohammedan jailkeeper, "Dear sir, you are a saintly person and are very fortunate. You have full knowledge of the revealed scriptures such as the Koran and similar books.

  ; [[.20:6|Cc. Madhya 20.6]]
  : "If one releases a conditioned soul or imprisoned person according to religious principles, he himself is also released from material bondage by the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

  ; [[.20:7|Cc. Madhya 20.7]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī continued, "Previously I have done much for you. Now I am in difficulty. Please return my goodwill by releasing me.

  ; [[.20:8|Cc. Madhya 20.8]]
  : "Here are five thousand gold coins. Please accept them. By releasing me, you will receive the results of pious activities and gain material profit as well. Thus you will profit in two ways simultaneously."

  ; [[.20:9|Cc. Madhya 20.9]]
  : In this way Sanātana Gosvāmī convinced the jailkeeper, who replied, "Please hear me, my dear sir. I am willing to release you, but I am afraid of the government."

  ; [[.20:10-11|Cc. Madhya 20.10-11]]
  : Sanātana replied, "There is no danger. The Nawab has gone to the south. If he returns, tell him that Sanātana went to pass stool near the bank of the Gages and that as soon as he saw the Ganges, he jumped in.

  ; [[.20:12|Cc. Madhya 20.12]]
  : "Tell him,'I looked for him a long time, but I could not find any trace of him. He jumped in with his shackles, and therefore he was drowned and washed away by the waves.'

  ; [[.20:13|Cc. Madhya 20.13]]
  : "There is no reason for you to be afraid, for I shall not remain in this country. I shall become a mendicant and go to the holy city of Mecca."

  ; [[.20:14|Cc. Madhya 20.14]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī could see that the mind of the meat-eater was still not satisfied. He then stacked Seven thousand gold coins before him.

  ; [[.20:15|Cc. Madhya 20.15]]
  : When the meat-eater saw the coins, he was attracted to them. He then agreed, and that night he cut Sanātana's shackles and let him cross the Ganges.

  ; [[.20:16|Cc. Madhya 20.16]]
  : In this way, Sanātana Gosvāmī was released. However, he was not able to walk along the path of the fortress. Walking day and night, he finally arrived at the hilly tract of land known as Pātaḍā.

  ; [[.20:17|Cc. Madhya 20.17]]
  : After reaching Pātaḍā, he met a landholder and submissively requested him to get him across that hilly tract of land.

  ; [[.20:18|Cc. Madhya 20.18]]
  : A man who was expert in palmistry was at that time staying with the landlord. Knowing about Sanātana, he whispered the following in the landlord's ear.

  ; [[.20:19|Cc. Madhya 20.19]]
  : The palmist said, "This man Sanātana possesses eight gold coins." Hearing this, the landlord was very pleased and spoke the following to Sanātana Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.20:20|Cc. Madhya 20.20]]
  : The landlord said, "I shall get you across that hilly tract at night with my own men. Now just take your lunch and cook for yourself."

  ; [[.20:21|Cc. Madhya 20.21]]
  : Saying this, the landlord offered Sanātana grains to cook. Sanātana then went to the riverside and took his bath.

  ; [[.20:22|Cc. Madhya 20.22]]
  : Because Sanātana had been fasting for two days, he cooked the food and ate it. However, having formerly been a minister of the Nawab, he began to contemplate the situation.

  ; [[.20:23|Cc. Madhya 20.23]]
  : As a former minister for the Nawab, Sanātana could certainly understand diplomacy. He therefore thought, "Why is this landlord offering me such respect?" Thinking in this way, he questioned his servant, whose name was Īśāna.

  ; [[.20:24|Cc. Madhya 20.24]]
  : Sanātana asked his servant, "Īśāna, I think you have some valuable things with you." Īśāna replied, "Yes, I have seven gold coins."

  ; [[.20:25|Cc. Madhya 20.25]]
  : Hearing this, Sanātana Gosvāmī chastised his servant, saying, "Why have you brought this death knell with you?"

  ; [[.20:26|Cc. Madhya 20.26]]
  : Thereupon, Sanātana Gosvāmī took the seven gold coins in his hands and went to the landlord. Holding the gold coins before him, he spoke as follows.

  ; [[.20:27|Cc. Madhya 20.27]]
  : "I have these seven gold coins with me. Please accept them, and from a religious point of view please get me across that hilly tract of land.

  ; [[.20:28|Cc. Madhya 20.28]]
  : "I am a prisoner of the government, and I cannot go along the way of the ramparts. It will be very pious of you to take this money and kindly get me across this hilly tract of land."

  ; [[.20:29|Cc. Madhya 20.29]]
  : Smiling, the landlord said, "Before you offered them, I already knew that there were eight gold coins in your servant's possession.

  ; [[.20:30|Cc. Madhya 20.30]]
  : "On this very night I would have killed you and taken your coins. It is very good that you have voluntarily offered them to me. I am now relieved from such a sinful activity.

  ; [[.20:31|Cc. Madhya 20.31]]
  : "I am very satisfied with your behavior. I shall not accept these gold coins, but I shall get you across that hilly tract of land simply to perform a pious activity."

  ; [[.20:32|Cc. Madhya 20.32]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī replied, "If you do not accept these coins, someone else will kill me for them. It is better that you save me from the danger by accepting the coins."

  ; [[.20:33|Cc. Madhya 20.33]]
  : After this settlement was made, the landlord gave Sanātana Gosvāmī four watchmen to accompany him. They went through the forest path for the whole night and thus brought him over the hilly tract of land.

  ; [[.20:34|Cc. Madhya 20.34]]
  : After crossing the hills, Sanātana Gosvāmī told his servant, "Īśāna, I think you still have some balance left from the gold coins."

  ; [[.20:35|Cc. Madhya 20.35]]
  : Īśāna replied, "I still have one gold coin in my possession." Sanātana Gosvāmī then said, "Take the coin and return to your home."

  ; [[.20:36|Cc. Madhya 20.36]]
  : After departing from Īśāna, Sanātana Gosvāmī began traveling alone with a waterpot in his hand. Simply covered with a torn quilt, he thus lost all his anxiety.

  ; [[.20:37|Cc. Madhya 20.37]]
  : Walking and walking, Sanātana Gosvāmī finally arrived at a place called Hājipura. That evening he sat down within a garden.

  ; [[.20:38|Cc. Madhya 20.38]]
  : In Hājipura there was a gentlemen named Śrīkānta, who happened to be the husband of Sanātana Gosvāmī's sister. He was engaged there in government service.

  ; [[.20:39|Cc. Madhya 20.39]]
  : Śrīkānta had 300,000 gold coins with him, which had been given to him by the emperor for the purchase of horses. Thus Śrīkānta was buying horses and dispatching them to the emperor.

  ; [[.20:40|Cc. Madhya 20.40]]
  : When Śrīkānta was sitting in an elevated place, he could see Sanātana Gosvāmī. That night he took a servant and went to see Sanātana Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.20:41|Cc. Madhya 20.41]]
  : When they met, they had many conversations. Sanātana Gosvāmī told him in detail about his arrest and release.

  ; [[.20:42|Cc. Madhya 20.42]]
  : Śrīkānta then told Sanātana Gosvāmī, "Stay here for at least two days and dress up like a gentleman. Abandon these dirty garments."

  ; [[.20:43|Cc. Madhya 20.43]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī replied, "I shall not stay here even for a moment. Please help me cross the Ganges. I shall leave immediately."

  ; [[.20:44|Cc. Madhya 20.44]]
  : With great care, Śrīkānta gave him a woolen blanket and helped him cross the Ganges. Thus Sanātana Gosvāmī departed again.

  ; [[.20:45|Cc. Madhya 20.45]]
  : After a few days, Sanātana Gosvāmī arrived at Vārāṇasī. He was very pleased to hear about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's arrival there.

  ; [[.20:46|Cc. Madhya 20.46]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī then went to the house of Candraśekhara and sat down by the door. Understanding what was happening, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spoke to Candraśekhara.

  ; [[.20:47|Cc. Madhya 20.47]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "There is a devotee at your door. Please call him in." Going outside, Candraśekhara could not see a Vaiṣṇava at his door.

  ; [[.20:48|Cc. Madhya 20.48]]
  : When Candraśekhara informed the Lord that no Vaiṣṇava was at his door, the Lord asked him, "Is there anyone at your door at all?"

  ; [[.20:49|Cc. Madhya 20.49]]
  : Candraśekhara replied, "There is a Muslim mendicant." Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately said, "Please bring him here." Candraśekhara then spoke to Sanātana Gosvāmī, who was still sitting beside the door.

  ; [[.20:50|Cc. Madhya 20.50]]
  : "O Muslim mendicant, please come in. The Lord is calling you." Sanātana Gosvāmī was very pleased to hear this order, and he entered Candraśekhara's house.

  ; [[.20:51|Cc. Madhya 20.51]]
  : As soon as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw Sanātana Gosvāmī in the courtyard, He immediately went up to him with great haste. After embracing him, the Lord was overwhelmed with ecstatic love.

  ; [[.20:52|Cc. Madhya 20.52]]
  : As soon as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu touched Sanātana Gosvāmī, Sanātana was also overwhelmed with ecstatic love. In a faltering voice, he said, "O my Lord, do not touch me."

  ; [[.20:53|Cc. Madhya 20.53]]
  : Shoulder to shoulder, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Sanātana Gosvāmī began to cry unlimitedly. Candraśekhara was very astonished to see this.

  ; [[.20:54|Cc. Madhya 20.54]]
  : Catching his hand, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took Sanātana Gosvāmī inside and made him sit in an elevated place next to Him.

  ; [[.20:55|Cc. Madhya 20.55]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began cleansing Sanātana Gosvāmī's body with His own transcendental had, Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "O my Lord, please do not touch me."

  ; [[.20:56|Cc. Madhya 20.56]]
  : The Lord replied, "I am touching you just to purify Myself because by the force of your devotional service you can purify the whole universe.

  ; [[.20:57|Cc. Madhya 20.57]]
  : " 'Saints of your caliber are themselves places of pilgrimage. Because of their purity, they are constant companions of the Lord, and therefore they can purify even the places of pilgrimage.'

  ; [[.20:58|Cc. Madhya 20.58]]
  : " 'Even though a person is a very learned scholar of the Sanskrit Vedic literatures, he is not accepted as My devotee unless he is pure in devotional service. However, even though a person is born in a family of dog-eaters, he is very dear to Me if he is a pure devotee who has no motive to enjoy fruitive activity or mental speculation. Indeed, all respects should be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as I am.'

  ; [[.20:59|Cc. Madhya 20.59]]
  : " 'One may be born in a brāhmaṇa family and have all twelve brahminical qualities, but if he is not devoted to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who has a navel shaped like a lotus, he is not as good as a caṇḍāla who has dedicated his mind, words, activities, wealth and life to the service of the Lord. Simply to take birth in a brāhmaṇa family or to have brahminical qualities is not sufficient. One must become a pure devotee of the Lord. If a śva-paca or caṇḍāla is a devotee, he delivers not only himself but his whole family, whereas a brāhmaṇa who is not a devotee but simply has brahminical qualifications cannot even purify himself, not to speak of his family.' "

  ; [[.20:60|Cc. Madhya 20.60]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "By seeing you, by touching you and by glorifying your transcendental qualities, one can perfect the purpose of all sense activity. This is the verdict of the revealed scriptures.

  ; [[.20:61|Cc. Madhya 20.61]]
  : " 'My dear Vaiṣṇava, seeing a person like you is the perfection of one's eyesight. Touching your lotus feet is the perfection of the sense of touch. Glorifying your good qualities is the tongue's real activity, for in the material world it is very difficult to find a pure devotee of the Lord.' "

  ; [[.20:62|Cc. Madhya 20.62]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "My dear Sanātana, please hear from Me. Kṛṣṇa is very merciful, and He is the deliverer of all fallen souls.

  ; [[.20:63|Cc. Madhya 20.63]]
  : "My dear Sanātana, Kṛṣṇa has saved you from Mahāraurava, life's deepest hell. He is an ocean of mercy, and His activities are very grave."

  ; [[.20:64|Cc. Madhya 20.64]]
  : Sanātana replied, "I do not know who Kṛṣṇa is. As far as I am concerned, I have been released from prison only by Your mercy."

  ; [[.20:65|Cc. Madhya 20.65]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked Sanātana Gosvāmī, "How were you released from prison?" Sanātana then described the story from beginning to end.

  ; [[.20:66|Cc. Madhya 20.66]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I met your two brothers, Rūpa and Anupama, at Prayāga. They have now gone to Vṛndāvana."

  ; [[.20:67|Cc. Madhya 20.67]]
  : By the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sanātana Gosvāmī met both Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara.

  ; [[.20:68|Cc. Madhya 20.68]]
  : Tapana Miśra then extended an invitation to Sanātana, and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Sanātana to go get a shave.

  ; [[.20:69|Cc. Madhya 20.69]]
  : After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu called Candraśekhara and asked him to take Sanātana Gosvāmī with him. He also asked him to take away Sanātana's present dress.

  ; [[.20:70|Cc. Madhya 20.70]]
  : Candraśekhara then made Sanātana Gosvāmī look like a gentleman. He took him to bathe in the Ganges, and afterwards he brought him a new set of clothes.

  ; [[.20:71|Cc. Madhya 20.71]]
  : Candraśekhara offered a new set of garments to Sanātana Gosvāmī, but Sanātana did not accept them. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard news of this, he became unlimitedly happy.

  ; [[.20:72|Cc. Madhya 20.72]]
  : After bathing at noon, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the house of Tapana Miśra for lunch. He took Sanātana Gosvāmī with Him.

  ; [[.20:73|Cc. Madhya 20.73]]
  : After washing His feet, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down for lunch. He asked Tapana Miśra to supply Sanātana Gosvāmī lunch also.

  ; [[.20:74|Cc. Madhya 20.74]]
  : Tapana Miśra then said, "Sanātana has some duty to perform; therefore he cannot accept lunch now. At the conclusion of the meal, I shall supply Sanātana with some remnants."

  ; [[.20:75|Cc. Madhya 20.75]]
  : After eating, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took rest for a while. Tapana Miśra then gave Sanātana Gosvāmī the remnants of food left by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.20:76|Cc. Madhya 20.76]]
  : When Tapana Miśra offered Sanātana Gosvāmī a new cloth, he did not accept it. Instead, he spoke as follows.

  ; [[.20:77|Cc. Madhya 20.77]]
  : "If you want to give me some cloth according to your desire, please give me an old cloth you have used."

  ; [[.20:78|Cc. Madhya 20.78]]
  : When Tapana Miśra gave Sanātana Gosvāmī a used dhoti, Sanātana immediately tore it in pieces to make two sets of outer cloth and underwear.

  ; [[.20:79|Cc. Madhya 20.79]]
  : When Caitanya Mahāprabhu introduced the Mahārāṣṭrīya brāhmaṇa to Sanātana, the brāhmaṇa immediately invited Sanātana Gosvāmī for full meals.

  ; [[.20:80|Cc. Madhya 20.80]]
  : The brāhmaṇa said, "My dear Sanātana, as long as you remain at Kāśī, please accept lunch at my place."

  ; [[.20:81|Cc. Madhya 20.81]]
  : Sanātana replied, "I shall practice the process of mādhukarī. Why should I accept full meals in the house of a brāhmaṇa?"

  ; [[.20:82|Cc. Madhya 20.82]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt unlimited happiness to observe Sanātana Gosvāmī's strict following of the principles of sannyāsa. However, He repeatedly glanced at the woolen blanket Sanātana Gosvāmī was wearing.

  ; [[.20:83|Cc. Madhya 20.83]]
  : Because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was repeatedly glancing at this valuable woolen blanket, Sanātana Gosvāmī could understand that the Lord did not approve of it. He then began to consider a way to give it up.

  ; [[.20:84|Cc. Madhya 20.84]]
  : Thinking in this way, Sanātana went to the bank of the Ganges to bathe. While there, he saw that a mendicant from Bengal had washed his quilt and had spread it out to dry.

  ; [[.20:85|Cc. Madhya 20.85]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī then told the Bengali mendicant, "My dear brother, please do me a favor. Trade me your quilt for this woolen blanket."

  ; [[.20:86|Cc. Madhya 20.86]]
  : The mendicant replied, "Sir, you are a respectable gentleman. Why are you joking with me? Why would you trade your valuable blanket for my torn quilt?"

  ; [[.20:87|Cc. Madhya 20.87]]
  : Sanātana said, "I am not joking; I am speaking the truth. Kindly take this blanket in exchange for your torn quilt."

  ; [[.20:88|Cc. Madhya 20.88]]
  : Saying this, Sanātana Gosvāmī exchanged the blanket for the quilt. He then returned to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with the quilt on his shoulder.

  ; [[.20:89|Cc. Madhya 20.89]]
  : When Sanātana Gosvāmī returned, the Lord asked, "Where is your woolen blanket?" Sanātana Gosvāmī then narrated the whole story to the Lord.

  ; [[.20:90-91|Cc. Madhya 20.90-91]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "I have already deliberately considered this matter. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is very merciful, He has nullified your attachment for material things. Why should Kṛṣṇa allow you to maintain a last bit of material attachment? After vanquishing a disease, a good physician does not allow any of the disease to remain.

  ; [[.20:92|Cc. Madhya 20.92]]
  : "It is contradictory to practice mādhukarī and at the same time wear a valuable blanket. One loses his spiritual strength by doing this, and one will also become an object for jokes."

  ; [[.20:93|Cc. Madhya 20.93]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī replied, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has saved me from the sinful life of material existence. By His desire, my last piece of material attraction is now gone."

  ; [[.20:94|Cc. Madhya 20.94]]
  : Being pleased with Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bestowed His causeless mercy upon him. By the Lord's mercy, Sanātana Gosvāmī received the spiritual strength to inquire from Him.

  ; [[.20:95-96|Cc. Madhya 20.95-96]]
  : Formerly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Rāmānanda Rāya spiritual questions, and by the Lord's causeless mercy, Rāmānanda Rāya could properly reply. Now, by the Lord's mercy, Sanātana Gosvāmī questioned the Lord, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally supplied the truth.

  ; [[.20:97|Cc. Madhya 20.97]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, personally told Sanātana Gosvāmī about Lord Kṛṣṇa's real identity. He also told him about the Lord's conjugal love, His personal opulence and the mellows of devotional service. All these truths were explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī by the Lord Himself out of His causeless mercy.

  ; [[.20:98|Cc. Madhya 20.98]]
  : Putting a straw in his mouth and bowing down, Sanātana Gosvāmī clasped the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and humbly spoke as follows.

  ; [[.20:99|Cc. Madhya 20.99]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "I was born in a low family, and my associates are all low-class men. I myself am fallen and am the lowest of men. Indeed, I have passed my whole life fallen in the well of sinful materialism.

  ; [[.20:100|Cc. Madhya 20.100]]
  : "I do not know what is beneficial for me and what is detrimental. Nonetheless, in ordinary dealings people consider me a learned scholar, and I am also thinking of myself as such.

  ; [[.20:101|Cc. Madhya 20.101]]
  : "Out of Your causeless mercy, You have delivered me from the materialistic path. Now, by the same causeless mercy, please tell me what my duty is.

  ; [[.20:102|Cc. Madhya 20.102]]
  : "Who am I? Why do the threefold miseries always give me trouble? If I do not know this, how can I be benefited?

  ; [[.20:103|Cc. Madhya 20.103]]
  : "Actually I do not know how to inquire about the goal of life and the process for obtaining it. Being merciful upon me, please explain all these truths."

  ; [[.20:104|Cc. Madhya 20.104]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Lord Kṛṣṇa has bestowed His full mercy upon you so that all these things are known to you. For you, the threefold miseries certainly do not exist.

  ; [[.20:105|Cc. Madhya 20.105]]
  : "Since you possess Lord Kṛṣṇa's potency, you certainly know these things. However, it is the nature of a sādhu to inquire. Although he knows these things, the sādhu inquires for the sake of strictness.

  ; [[.20:106|Cc. Madhya 20.106]]
  : " 'Those who are anxious to awaken their spiritual consciousness, who have unflinching intelligence and who are not deviated, certainly attain the desired goal.'

  ; [[.20:107|Cc. Madhya 20.107]]
  : "You are fit to propagate the cult of devotional service. Therefore gradually hear all the truths about it from Me. I shall tell you about them.

  ; [[.20:108-109|Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]
  : "It is the living entity's constitutional position to be an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa because he is the marginal energy of Kṛṣṇa and a manifestation simultaneously one and different from the Lord, like a molecular particle of sunshine or fire. Kṛṣṇa has three varieties of energy.

  : " 'In the Tretā-yuga, the Lord appeared in a body that had a reddish hue and four arms. There were three distinctive lines on His abdomen, and His hair was golden. His form manifested the Vedic knowledge, and He bore the symbols of a sacrificial spoon, ladle and so on.'

  ; [[.20:334|Cc. Madhya 20.334]]
  : "As the white incarnation, the Lord taught religion and meditation. He offered benedictions to Kardama Muni, and in this way He showed His causeless mercy.

  : "In the Satya-yuga the people were generally advanced in spiritual knowledge and could meditate upon Kṛṣṇa very easily. The people's occupational duty in Tretā-yuga was to perform great sacrifices. This was induced by the Personality of Godhead in His reddish incarnation.

  ; [[.20:336|Cc. Madhya 20.336]]
  : "In Dvāpara-yuga the people's occupational duty was to worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa, appearing in a blackish body, personally induced people to worship Him.

  : " 'In the Dvāpara-yuga the Personality of Godhead appears in a blackish hue. He is dressed in yellow, He holds His own weapons, and He is decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and marks of Śrīvatsa. That is how His symptoms are described.'

  : "Thus I have given a description of the incarnations of the four different yugas." After hearing all this, Sanātana Gosvāmī gave an indirect hint to the Lord.

  ; [[.20:350|Cc. Madhya 20.350]]
  : Sanātana Gosvāmī had been a minister under Nawab Hussain Shah, and he was undoubtedly as intelligent as Bṛhaspati, the chief priest of the heavenly kingdom. Due to the Lord's unlimited mercy, Sanātana Gosvāmī questioned Him without hesitation.

  : Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "I am a very insignificant living entity. I am low and poorly behaved. How can I understand who is the incarnation for this Age of Kali?"

  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "As in other ages an incarnation is accepted according to the directions of the śāstras, in this Age of Kali an incarnation of God should be accepted in that way.

  ; [[.20:354|Cc. Madhya 20.354]]
  : "An actual incarnation of God never says, 'I am God,' or 'I am an incarnation of God.' The great sage Vyāsadeva, knowing all, has already recorded the characteristics of the avatāras in the śāstras.

  : " 'The Lord does not have a material body, yet He descends among human beings in His transcendental body as an incarnation.

  : "In the auspicious invocation in the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrīla Vyāsadeva has described the Supreme Personality of Godhead by these symptoms.

  : " 'I offer my obeisances unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, who is the supreme all-pervading Personality of Godhead. I meditate upon Him, the transcendent reality, who is the primeval cause of all causes, from whom all manifested universes arise, in whom they dwell and by whom they are destroyed. I meditate upon that eternally effulgent Lord who is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations and yet is beyond them. It is He only who first imparted Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmā, the first created being. Through Him this world, like a mirage, appears real even to great sages and demigods. Because of Him, the material universes, created by the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I meditate, therefore, upon Him, the Absolute Truth, who is eternally existent in His transcendental abode and who is forever free of illusion.'

  ; [[.20:360|Cc. Madhya 20.360]]
  : "In this invocation from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the word param indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the word satyam indicates His personal characteristics.

  : "In that same verse it is stated that the Lord is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of the cosmic manifestation, and that He enabled Lord Brahmā to create the universe by infusing him with the knowledge of the Vedas. It is also stated that the Lord has full knowledge directly and indirectly, that He knows past, present and future and that His personal energy is separate from māyā, the illusory energy.

  ; [[.20:362|Cc. Madhya 20.362]]
  : "All these activities are His marginal characteristics. Great saintly persons understand the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the indications of the two characteristics known as svarūpa and taṭastha. All the incarnations of Kṛṣṇa should be understood in this way.

  ; [[.20:363|Cc. Madhya 20.363]]
  : "At the time of Their appearance, the incarnations of the Lord are known in the world because people can consult the śāstras to understand the incarnation's chief characteristics, known as svarūpa and taṭastha. In this way the incarnations become known to great saintly persons."

  : "Some śaktyāveśa-avatāras are the four Kumāras, Nārada, Mahārāja Pṛthu and Paraśurāma. When a living being is empowered to act as Lord Brahmā, he is also considered a śaktyāveśa-avatāra.

  ; [[.20:370|Cc. Madhya 20.370]]
  : "Lord Śeṣa in the spiritual world of Vaikuṇṭha and, in the material world, Lord Ananta, who carries innumerable planets on His hood, are two primary empowered incarnations. There is no need to count the others, for they are unlimited.

  ; [[.20:371|Cc. Madhya 20.371]]
  : "The power of knowledge was invested in the four Kumāras, and the power of devotional service was invested in Nārada. The power of creation was invested in Lord Brahmā, and the power to carry innumerable planets was invested in Lord Ananta.

  ; [[.20:372|Cc. Madhya 20.372]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead invested the power of personal service to Lord Śeṣa, and He invested the power to rule the earth in King Pṛthu. Lord Paraśurāma received the power to kill rogues and miscreants.

  : "The consecutive pastimes of Kṛṣṇa are manifest in one of the innumerable universes moment after moment. There is no possibility of counting the universes, but in any case some pastime of the Lord is being manifest at every moment in one universe or another.

  : "Descriptions of Kṛṣṇa's eternal pastimes are in all revealed scriptures. But one cannot understand how they are continuing eternally.

  ; [[.20:386|Cc. Madhya 20.386]]
  : "Let me give an example by which people may understand Lord Kṛṣṇa's eternal pastimes. An example can be found in the zodiac.

  ; [[.20:387|Cc. Madhya 20.387]]
  : "The sun moves across the zodiac day and night and crosses the oceans between the seven islands one after the other.

  ; [[.20:388|Cc. Madhya 20.388]]

  : "Day and night are divided into eight praharas-four belonging to the day and four belonging to the night. After eight praharas, the sun rises again.

  ; [[.20:391|Cc. Madhya 20.391]]
  : "Just like the sun, there is an orbit to Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, which are manifest one after the other. During the lifetime of fourteen Manus, this orbit expands through all the universes, and gradually it returns. Thus Kṛṣṇa moves with His pastimes through all the universes, one after another.

  ; [[.20:392|Cc. Madhya 20.392]]
  : "Kṛṣṇa remains within a universe for 125 years, and He enjoys His pastimes both in Vṛndāvana and Dvārakā.

  : "Kṛṣṇa's pastimes-appearance, childhood, boyhood and youth-are all manifest, beginning with the killing of Pūtanā and extending to the end of mauṣala-līlā, the annihilation of the Yadu dynasty. All of these pastimes are rotating in every universe.

  ; [[.20:395|Cc. Madhya 20.395]]
  : "Since all Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are taking place continuously, at every moment some pastime is existing in one universe or another. Consequently these pastimes are called eternal by the Vedas and Purāṇas.
