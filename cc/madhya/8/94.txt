**"Although Kṛṣṇa's unparalleled beauty is the topmost sweetness of love of Godhead, His sweetness increases unlimitedly when He is in the company of the gopīs. Consequently Kṛṣṇa's exchange of love with the gopīs is the topmost perfection of love of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa and His devotees become perfectly intimate in conjugal love of Godhead. In other mellows, the Lord and the devotees do not enjoy transcendental bliss as perfectly. The next verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.33.6) will illustrate this verse.
