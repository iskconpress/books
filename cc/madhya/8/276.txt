===== Purport =====

This verse (//Bhāg.// 10.35.9) is one of the songs the //gopīs// sang during Kṛṣṇa's absence. In Kṛṣṇa's absence the //gopīs// were always absorbed in thought of Him. Similarly, the //mahā-bhāgavata,// the advanced devotee, sees everything as potentially serving the Lord. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states:

> prāpañcikatayā buddhyā
> hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ
> mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo
> vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate

(//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.126)

The advanced devotee does not see anything that is not connected with Kṛṣṇa. Unlike the Māyāvādī philosophers, a devotee does not see the material world as false. Rather, he sees everything in the material world connected to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee knows how to utilize such things in the service of the Lord, and this is characteristic of the //mahā-bhāgavata.// The //gopīs// saw the plants, creepers and forest trees loaded with fruits and flowers and ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. In this way they immediately remembered their worshipable Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. They did not simply see plants, creepers and trees the way a mundaner sees them.
