===== Purport =====

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(Bg. 9.32)]] the Lord says:

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim

"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth-women, //vaiśyas// [merchants], as well as //śūdras// [workers]---can attain the supreme destination."

The word //pāpa-yonayaḥ// means "born of lower-caste women." The //vaiśyas// are merchants, and the //śūdras// or workers are servants. According to Vedic classifications, they belong to a lower social order. A low life means a life without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. High and low positions in society were calculated by considering a person's Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A //brāhmaṇa// is considered to be on the highest platform because he knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth. The second caste, the //kṣatriya// caste, also know Brahman, but not as well as the //brāhmaṇas.// The //vaiśyas// and //śūdras// do not clearly understand God consciousness, but if they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, they do not remain in the lower castes (//pāpa-yonayaḥ//). It is clearly stated: //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.//

Unless one has attained the highest standard of life, one cannot return home, back to Godhead. One may be a //śūdra, vaiśya// or woman, but if one is situated in the service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one should not be considered //strī, śūdra, vaiśya// or lower than //śūdra.//  Though a person may be from a lowborn family, if he is engaged in the Lord's service he should never be considered to belong to a lowborn family. The //Padma Purāṇa// forbids: //vīkṣate jāti-sāmānyāt sa yāti narakaṁ-dhruvam.// A person goes to hell quickly when he considers a devotee of the Lord in terms of birth. Although Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya supposedly took birth in a //śūdra// family, he is not to be considered a //śūdra,// for he was a great advanced devotee. Indeed, he was on the transcendental platform. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore embraced him. Out of spiritual humility, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya presented himself as a //śūdra// (//rāja-sevī viṣayī śūdrādhama//). Even though one may engage in government service or in any other pound-shilling-pence business-in short, in materialistic life-he need only take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a very simple process. One need only chant the holy names of the Lord and strictly follow the principles forbidding sinful activity. In this way one can no longer be considered an untouchable, a //viṣayī// or a //śūdra.// One who is advanced in spiritual life should not associate with nondevotees-namely men in government service and men engaged in materialistic activity for sense gratification or in the service of others. Such men are considered //viṣayī,// materialistic. It is said:

> niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya
> pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya
> sandarśanaṁ viṣayiṇām atha yoṣitāṁ ca
> hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu

"A person who is very seriously engaged in cultivating devotional service with a view to crossing the ocean of nescience and who has completely abandoned all material activities should never see a //śūdra,// a //vaiśya// or a woman." (//Śrī Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka// 8.23)
