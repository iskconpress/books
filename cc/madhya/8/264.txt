===== Purport =====

The heart of Brahmā was enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is Vedic information given in the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// (6.18):

> yo brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti pūrvaṁ
> yo vai vedāṁś ca prahiṇoti tasmai
> taṁ ha devam ātma-buddhi-prakāśaṁ
> mumukṣur vai śaraṇam ahaṁ prapadye

"Because I desire liberation, let me surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who first enlightened Lord Brahmā in Vedic knowledge through Lord Brahmā's heart. The Lord is the original source of all enlightenment and spiritual advancement." In this connection one may also refer to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// 2.9.30-35, 11.14.3, 12.4.40 and 12.13.19.
