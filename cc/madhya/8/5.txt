===== Purport =====

The goddess of fortune is always embraced by Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. This is mentioned in the commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// written by the great commentator Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī. The following verse was composed by Śrīdhara Svāmī in his commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.87.1):

> vāg-īśā yasya vadane
> lakṣmīr yasya ca vakṣasi
> yasyāste hṛdaye samvit
> taṁ nṛsiṁham ahaṁ bhaje

"Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is always assisted by Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, and He is always embracing to His chest the goddess of fortune. The Lord is always complete in knowledge within Himself. Let us offer obeisances unto Nṛsiṁhadeva."

Similarly, in his commentary on the First Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:1:1|(1.1.1)]], Śrīdhara Svāmī describes Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva in this way:

> prahlāda-hṛdayāhlādaṁ
> bhaktāvidyā-vidāraṇam
> śarad-indu-ruciṁ vande
> pārīndra-vadanaṁ harim

"Let me offer my obeisances unto Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, who is always enlightening Prahlāda Mahārāja within his heart and who always kills the nescience that attacks the devotees. His mercy is distributed like moonshine, and His face is like that of a lion. Let me offer my obeisances unto Him again and again."
