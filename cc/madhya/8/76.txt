The stage of loving service to the Lord in paternal affection is an advanced stage of love in fraternity. In the fraternal relationship there is a sense of equality, but when that sense of equality is advanced in affection, one attains the platform of parental love. In this connection, the following verse is cited from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.8.46), wherein Śukadeva Gosvāmī voices his appreciation of Nanda Mahārāja's and mother Yaśodā's intense love for Kṛṣṇa.
