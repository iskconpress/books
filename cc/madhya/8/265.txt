===== Purport =====

Here Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya admits that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supersoul. It is the Supersoul that inspires the devotee; therefore He is the original source of the Gāyatrī //mantra// which states, //oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ pracodayāt. Savitāṛ// is the original source of all intelligence. That //savitāṛ// is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:4:22|(2.4.22)]]:

> pracoditā yena purā sarasvatī
> vitanvatājasya satīṁ smṛtiṁ hṛdi
> sva-lakṣaṇā prādurabhūt kilāsyataḥ
> sa me ṛṣīṇām ṛṣabhaḥ prasīdatām

"May the Lord, who in the beginning of the creation amplified the potent knowledge of Brahmā from within his heart and inspired him with full knowledge of creation and His own self, and who appeared to be generated from the mouth of Brahmā, be pleased with me." This was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī when he invoked the blessing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead before delivering //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to Mahārāja Parīkṣit.
