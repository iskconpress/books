This verse is very important to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. In his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains that one should not think that because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born a //brāhmaṇa// and was situated in the topmost spiritual order as a //sannyāsī,// it was improper for Him to receive instructions from Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya, who belonged to the //śūdra// caste. To clarify this matter, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Rāmānanda Rāya that knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is more important than caste. In the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma// there are various duties for the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// Actually the //brāhmaṇa// is supposed to be the spiritual master of all other //varṇas,// or sects, but as far as Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned, everyone is capable of becoming a spiritual master because knowledge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is on the platform of the spirit soul. To spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one need only be cognizant of the science of the spirit soul. It does not matter whether one is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, sannyāsī, gṛhastha// or whatever. If one simply understands this science, he can become a spiritual master.

It is stated in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// that one should not accept initiation from a person who is not in the brahminical order if there is a fit person in the brahminical order present. This instruction is meant for those who are overly dependent on the mundane social order and is suitable for those who want to remain in mundane life. If one understands the truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and seriously desires to attain transcendental knowledge for the perfection of life, he can accept a spiritual master from any social status, provided the spiritual master is fully conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura also states that although one is situated as a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, vānaprastha, gṛhastha// or //sannyāsī,// if he is conversant in the science of Kṛṣṇa he can become a spiritual master as //vartma-pradarśaka-guru, dīkṣā-guru// or //śikṣā-guru.// The spiritual master who first gives information about spiritual life is called the //vartma-pradarśaka-guru,// the spiritual master who initiates according to the regulations of the //śāstras// is called the //dīkṣā-guru,// and the spiritual master who gives instructions for elevation is called the //śikṣā-guru.// Factually the qualifications of a spiritual master depend on his knowledge of the science of Kṛṣṇa. It does not matter whether he is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, sannyāsī// or //śūdra.// This injunction given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is not at all against the injunctions of the //śāstras.// In the //Padma Purāṇa// it is said:

> na śūdrāḥ bhagavad-bhaktās
> te 'pi bhāgavatottamāḥ
> sarva-varṇeṣu te śūdrā
> ye na bhaktā janārdane

One who is actually advanced in spiritual knowledge of Kṛṣṇa is never a //śūdra,// even though he may have been born in a //śūdra// family. However, even if a //vipra,// or //brāhmaṇa,// is very expert in the six brahminical activities (//paṭhana, pāṭhana, yajana, yājana, dāna, pratigraha//) and is also well versed in the Vedic hymns, he cannot become a spiritual master unless he is a Vaiṣṇava. But if one is born in the family of //caṇḍālas// yet is well versed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can become a //guru.// These are the śāstric injunctions, and strictly following these injunctions, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a //gṛhastha// named Śrī Viśvambhara, was initiated by a //sannyāsī-guru// named Īśvara Purī. Similarly, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu was initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, a //sannyāsī.// According to others, however, He was initiated by Lakṣmīpati Tīrtha. Advaita Ācārya, although a //gṛhastha,// was initiated by Mādhavendra Purī, and Śrī Rasikānanda, although born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, was initiated by Śrī Śyāmānanda Prabhu, who was not born in a caste //brāhmaṇa// family. There are many instances in which a born //brāhmaṇa// took initiation from a person who was not born in a //brāhmaṇa// family. The brahminical symptoms are explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|(7.11.35)]], wherein it is stated:

> yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam
> yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet

If a person is born in a //śūdra// family but has all the qualities of a spiritual master, he should be accepted not only as a //brāhmaṇa// but as a qualified spiritual master also. This is also the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura therefore introduced the sacred thread ceremony for all Vaiṣṇavas according to the rules and regulations.

Sometimes a Vaiṣṇava who is a //bhajanānandī// does not take the //sāvitra-saṁskāra// (sacred thread initiation), but this does not mean that this system should be used for preaching work. There are two kinds of Vaiṣṇavas-//bhajanānandī// and //goṣṭhy-ānandī. A bhajanānandī// is not interested in preaching work, but a //goṣṭhy-ānandī// is interested in spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness to benefit the people and increase the number of Vaiṣṇavas. A Vaiṣṇava is understood to be above the position of a //brāhmaṇa.// As a preacher, he should be recognized as a //brāhmaṇa;// otherwise there may be a misunderstanding of his position as a Vaiṣṇava. However, a Vaiṣṇava //brāhmaṇa// is not selected on the basis of his birth but according to his qualities. Unfortunately, those who are unintelligent do not know the difference between a //brāhmaṇa// and a Vaiṣṇava. They are under the impression that unless one is a //brāhmaṇa// he cannot be a spiritual master. For this reason only, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu makes the statement in this verse:

> kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru' haya

If one becomes a //guru,// he is automatically a //brāhmaṇa.// Sometimes a caste //guru// says that //ye kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei guru haya// means that one who is not a //brāhmaṇa// may become a //śikṣā-guru// or a //vartma-pradarśaka-guru// but not an initiator //guru.// According to such caste //gurus,// birth and family ties are considered foremost. However, the hereditary consideration is not acceptable to Vaiṣṇavas. The word //guru// is equally applicable to the //vartma-pradarśaka-guru, śikṣā-guru// and //dīkṣā-guru.// Unless we accept the principle enunciated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement cannot spread all over the world. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's intentions: //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's cult must be preached all over the world. This does not mean that people should take to His teachings and remain //śūdras// or //caṇḍālas.// As soon as one is trained as a pure Vaiṣṇava, he must be accepted as a bona fide //brāhmaṇa.// This is the essence of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instructions in this verse.
