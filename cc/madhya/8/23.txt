===== Purport =====

Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya was an incarnation of the //gopī// Viśākhā. Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, there was naturally an awakening of love between Viśākhā and Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the combination of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa. The //gopī// Viśākhā is a principal //gopī// assisting Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced, since their natural love also was awakened.
