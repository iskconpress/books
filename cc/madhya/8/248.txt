===== Translation =====

**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Of all kinds of distress, what is the most painful?"**


**Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Apart from separation from the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, I know of no unbearable unhappiness."**

===== Purport =====

Concerning this, the Lord states in the Vedic literature:

> mām anārādhya duḥkhārtaḥ
> kuṭumbāsakta-mānasaḥ
> sat-saṅga-rahito martyo
> vṛddha-sevā-paricyutaḥ

"A person who does not worship Me, who is unduly attached to family and who does not stick to devotional service must be considered a most unhappy person. Similarly, one who does not associate with Vaiṣṇavas, or who does not render service to his superior, is also a most unhappy person."

There is also a statement given in the //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta// (1.5.51):

> sva-jīvanādhikaṁ prārthyaṁ
> śrī-viṣṇu-jana-saṅgataḥ
> vicchedena kṣaṇaṁ cātra
> na sukhāṁśaṁ labhāmahe

"[King Yudhiṣṭhira said:] 'Out of all kinds of desirable things experienced in the life of a living entity, association with the devotees of the Lord is the greatest. When we are separated from a devotee even for a moment, we cannot enjoy happiness.' "
