===== Purport =====

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī first smears Her body with the paste of affection for Kṛṣṇa. She then takes Her bath in the water of mercy. After passing the //paugaṇḍa// age (from five to ten years), Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī first appears as mercy. The second bath, taken at noon, is taken in the water of //tāruṇyāmṛta,// or the nectar of youth. This is the actual expression of Her new youthfulness.
