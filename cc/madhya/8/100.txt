===== Purport =====

The name Rādhā is derived from this verse (//Bhāg.// 10.30.28), from the words //anayārādhitaḥ,// meaning "by Her the Lord is worshiped." Sometimes the critics of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// find it difficult to find Rādhārāṇī's holy name, but the secret is disclosed here in the word //ārādhitaḥ,// from which the name //Rādhā// has come. Of course, the name of Rādhārāṇī is directly mentioned in other //Purāṇas.// This //gopī's// worship of Kṛṣṇa is topmost, and therefore Her name is Rādhā, or the topmost worshiper.
