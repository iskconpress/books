===== Purport =====

Everyone in this material world is attempting to acquire riches to satisfy the senses. Actually no one cares for anything other than acquiring material possessions and maintaining them. The wealthy are generally accepted as the most important personalities in this material world, but when we compare a material man of wealth to one wealthy in devotional service to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, the latter is found to be the greatest capitalist. According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.39.2):

> kim alabhyaṁ bhagavati
> prasanne śrī-niketane
> tathāpi tat-parā rājan
> na hi vāñchanti kiñcana

"What is difficult for the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the shelter of the goddess of fortune? Although such devotees can obtain anything, O King, they do not desire anything."
