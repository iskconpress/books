This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:9:5:16|(9.5.16)]] and is an admission by the great sage Durvāsā Muni. Durvāsā Muni, a caste //brāhmaṇa// and great //yogī,// used to hate Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. When he decided to chastise Mahārāja Ambarīṣa through his yogic powers, he was chased by the Sudarśana //cakra// of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When things were settled, he said, "When the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is heard by any person, that person is immediately sanctified. The Supreme Lord is master of the devotees, and the devotees, under His shelter, naturally come to own His opulences."
