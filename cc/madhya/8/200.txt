Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has advised us to hear about Kṛṣṇa from a Vaiṣṇava. He has explicitly forbidden us to hear from an //avaiṣṇava.//

> avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ
> pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam
> śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyaṁ
> sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ

Thus quoting from //Padma Purāṇa,// Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī warns that one should not hear anything about Kṛṣṇa from an //avaiṣṇava,// however great a mundane scholar he may be. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Kṛṣṇa given by an //avaiṣṇava// are also poisonous. However, because a Vaiṣṇava is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his talks are spiritually potent. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]] the Supreme Lord says,

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ
> taṁ yena mām upayānti te

"To those who are constantly devoted to worshiping Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." When a pure Vaiṣṇava speaks, he speaks perfectly. How is this? His speech is managed by Kṛṣṇa Himself from within the heart. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya accepts this benediction from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore he admits that whatever he was speaking was not derived from his own intelligence. Rather, everything was coming from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. According to the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]:

> sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo
> mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca
> vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
> vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham

"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the //Vedas,// I am to be known. Indeed I am the compiler of //Vedānta,// and I am the knower of the //Vedas.//"

All intelligence emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the heart of everyone. Nondevotees want to ask the Supreme Lord for sense gratification; therefore nondevotees come under the influence of //māyā,// the illusory energy. A devotee, however, is directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes under the influence of //yogamāyā.// Consequently there is a gulf of difference between statements made by a devotee and those made by a nondevotee.
