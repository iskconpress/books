===== Purport =====

In his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states, "Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the creeper of love of Godhead, and the //gopīs// are exactly like twigs, flowers and leaves. When water is sprinkled on the creeper, the twigs, flowers and leaves indirectly receive all the benefits of the creeper itself. But water sprinkled directly on the twigs, leaves and flowers is not as effective as water sprinkled on the creeper's root. The //gopīs// are not as pleased when they directly mix with Kṛṣṇa as when they serve to unite Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī with Kṛṣṇa. Their transcendental pleasure lies in uniting Them."
