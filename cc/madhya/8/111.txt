During the //rāsa// dance, one form of Kṛṣṇa was between every two //gopīs.// But by the side of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī there was only one Kṛṣṇa. Although this was the case, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī still manifested disagreement with Kṛṣṇa. This verse is from the //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi// (//Śṛṅgāra-bheda-kathana// 102), written by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.
