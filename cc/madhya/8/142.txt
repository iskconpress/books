By virtue of His expanding attractive features, He subjugated the gopīs named Tārakā and Pāli and absorbed the minds of Śyāmā and Lalitā.

===== Purport =====

Everyone has a particular transcendental mellow by which he loves and serves Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the most attractive feature for every kind of devotee. He is therefore called //akhila-rasāmṛta-mūrti,// the transcendental form of attraction for all kinds of devotees, whether the devotee be in the //śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa// or //mādhurya-rasa.//

This is the opening verse of the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.
