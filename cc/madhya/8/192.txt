These statements are set forth for our understanding, according to Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// In essence, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Rāmānanda Rāya, "My dear Rāmānanda, the explanation you have given about the goal of life and the pastimes of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa is certainly the truth. Although this is factual, you can continue telling Me more if there is anything more to say." In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, "I do not think I have anything to say beyond this, but there is a topic known as //prema-vilāsa-vivarta,// which I may explain to You. I do not know whether it will bring You happiness or not."
