===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the invitation of the Vaiṣṇava //brāhmaṇa.// Even though one is a //brāhmaṇa// strictly following all the rules and regulations of brahminical culture, if he is not a devotee, a follower of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one should not accept his invitation. At the present moment people have become so degraded that they do not even follow the Vedic principles, to say nothing of Vaiṣṇava principles. They eat anything and everything-whatever they like-and therefore the members of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be very cautious about accepting invitations.
