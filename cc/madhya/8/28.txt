**While the brāhmaṇas were thinking in this way about the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw those outsiders and restrained His transcendental emotions.**

===== Purport =====

Rāmānanda Rāya was intimately related to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu; therefore he can be accepted as a //sajātīya,// a person within the intimate circle of the Lord. The //brāhmaṇas,// however, were followers of the Vedic rituals and were not able to have an intimate connection with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Consequently they are called //vijātīya-loka.// In other words, they were not pure devotees. One may be a highly learned //brāhmaṇa,// but if he is not a pure devotee he is a //vijātīya,// an outcaste, one outside devotional service-in other words, a nondevotee. Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya were embracing in ecstasy, the Lord restrained His transcendental emotions upon seeing the outsider //brāhmaṇas.//
