**"Addressing Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu [the Mahāpuruṣa] said, 'I wanted to see both of you, and therefore I have brought the sons of the brāhmaṇa here.

===== Purport =====

This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.89.58) concerning Kṛṣṇa's endeavor to take Arjuna beyond the material universe when Arjuna was searching for the sons of a //brāhmaṇa.//

Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is situated beyond this material world, was also attracted by the bodily features of Kṛṣṇa. Mahā-Viṣṇu had actually stolen the sons of the //brāhmaṇa// in Dvārakā so that Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna would come visit Him. This verse is quoted to show that Kṛṣṇa is so attractive that He attracts Mahā-Viṣṇu.
