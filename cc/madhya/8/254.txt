According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.47.61):

> āsām aho caraṇa-reṇu-juṣām ahaṁ syām
> vṛndāvane kim api gulma-latauṣadhīnām
> yā dustyajaṁ sva-janam ārya-pathaṁ ca hitvā
> bhejur mukunda-padavīṁ śrutibhir vimṛgyām

"[Uddhava said:] 'Let me become one of Vṛndāvana's herbs and plants that are trampled by the gopīs, who gave up all connections with family and friends and decided to worship the lotus feet of Mukunda. Those lotus feet are sought by all great saintly persons expert in the study of Vedic literature.' "
