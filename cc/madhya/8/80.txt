{{description>" 'When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, He put His arms around their necks and embraced them. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or the other consorts in the spiritual world. Nor was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, girls whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who may be very, very beautiful according to material estimation?'}}

This verse (//Bhāg.// 10.47.60) was spoken by Uddhava when he visited Śrī Vṛndāvana to deliver a message from Kṛṣṇa to the //gopīs.// Uddhava remained in Vṛndāvana to observe the movements of the //gopīs// there. When he saw the ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa in separation manifested by the //gopīs,// he appreciated their supreme love and therefore expressed his feelings in this verse. He admitted that the fortune of the //gopīs// could not be compared even to the fortune of the goddess of fortune, to say nothing of the beautiful girls in the heavenly planets.
