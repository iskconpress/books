In this connection, Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī instructs in his book //Manaḥ-śiksā// (2):

> na dharmaṁ nādharmaṁ śruti-gaṇa-niruktaṁ kila kuru
> vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pracura-paricaryām iha tanu

He has thus enjoined that we should not perform religious or irreligious activities as prescribed in the //Vedas.// The best course is to engage always in the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. That is the perfection of everything in this life. Similarly, in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:4:29:46|(4.29.46)]] it is said by Nārada Muni:

> yadā yasyānugṛhṇāti
> bhagavān ātma-bhāvitaḥ
> sa jahāti matiṁ loke
> vede ca pariniṣṭhitām

"When one actually takes to the loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he gives up all duties in the material world, as well as all duties prescribed by the Vedic literature. In this way one is fixed in the service of the Lord."
