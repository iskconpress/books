===== Purport =====

The word //rahaḥ-sthāne,// "in a secluded place," is very significant. Talks about Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes-especially His pastimes in Vṛndāvana and His dealings with the //gopīs//-are all very confidential. They are not subject matter for public discussion because those who have no understanding of the transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes always commit great offenses, thinking Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being and the //gopīs// ordinary girls. Following the principle of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who never discussed the dealings between Kṛṣṇa and the //gopīs// publicly, devotees in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are enjoined not to discuss the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana in public. For the general public, //saṅkīrtana// is the most effective method to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If possible, one should discuss the principles enunciated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu followed this principle very strictly and discussed the philosophy of the //Bhagavad-gītā// with learned scholars like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. However, He taught the principles of the //bhakti// cult to students like Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī, and He discussed with Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya the topmost devotional dealings between Kṛṣṇa and the //gopīs.// For the general populace, He performed //saṅkīrtana// very vigorously. We must also follow these principles in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.
