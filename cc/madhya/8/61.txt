===== Purport =====

A //brāhmaṇa// may renounce his family and accept //sannyāsa.// Others also-//kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas//-may also give up their families and take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such renunciation is called //karma-tyāga.// By such renunciation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied. But this renouncing of one's activities to Kṛṣṇa is not uncontaminated and is therefore on the material platform. Such activities are considered within the material universe because, according to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they refer to the material universe and are therefore external. To correct this, Rāmānanda Rāya recommended that one take to the renounced order of life in order to transcend material activities. This is supported by the following verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.11.32).
