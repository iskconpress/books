The twenty different moods headed by //kila-kiñcita// are described as follows. First, in connection with the body, there are //bhāva// (ecstasy), //hāva// (gestures) and //helā// (negligence); in relation to the self there are //śobhā// (beauty), //kānti// (luster), //dīpti// (brilliance), //mādhurya// (sweetness), //pragalbhatā// (impudence), //audārya// (magnanimity) and //dhairya// (patience); and in relation to nature, there are //līlā// (pastimes), //vilāsa// (enjoyment), //vicchitti// (breaking off) and //vibhrama// (puzzlement). There are no English equivalents for the words //kila-kiñcita, moṭṭāyita// and //kuṭṭamita.//

A flower garland constitutes the qualities of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and is divided into mental, verbal and bodily parts. Her attitude of forgiveness and mercy is all mental. Her talks, which are very pleasing to the ear, are verbal. The physical qualities-age, beauty, luster and grace-are bodily qualities.
