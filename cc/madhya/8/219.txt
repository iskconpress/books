{{description>"All the gopīs said, 'Dear Kṛṣṇa, we carefully hold Your delicate lotus feet upon our hard breasts. When You walk in the forest, Your soft lotus feet are pricked by small bits of stone. We fear that this is paining You. Since You are our life and soul, and our minds are very disturbed when Your lotus feet are pained.'}}
