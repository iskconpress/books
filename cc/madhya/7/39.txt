This Kṛṣṇadāsa, known as Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa, is not the Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa mentioned in the Eleventh Chapter, verse 37, of the //Ādi-līlā.// The Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa mentioned in the Eleventh Chapter is one of the twelve //gopālas// (cowherd boys) who appeared to substantiate the pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is known as a great devotee of Lord Nityānanda Prabhu. The //brāhmaṇa// named Kālā Kṛṣṇadāsa who went with Śrī Caitanya to South India and later to Bengal is mentioned in the //Madhya-līlā,// Tenth Chapter, verses 62-79. One should not take these two to be the same person.
