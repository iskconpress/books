In the //varṇāśrama-dharma,// the //śūdra// is the fourth division in the social status. //Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdrasyāpi svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|(Bg. 18.44)]]. //Śūdras// are meant to engage in the service of the three higher classes-//brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas.// Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya belonged to the //karaṇa// class, which is the equivalent of the //kāyastha// class in Bengal. This class is regarded all over India as //śūdra.// It is said that the Bengali //kāyasthas// were originally engaged as servants of //brāhmaṇas// who came from North India to Bengal. Later, the clerical class became the //kāyasthas// in Bengal. Now there are many mixed classes known as //kāyastha.// Sometimes it is said in Bengal that those who cannot claim any particular class belong to the //kāyastha// class. Although these //kāyasthas// or //karaṇas// are considered //śūdras,// they are very intelligent and highly educated. Most of them are professionals such as lawyers or politicians. Thus in Bengal the //kāyasthas// are sometimes considered //kṣatriyas.// In Orissa, however, the //kāyastha// class, which includes the //karaṇas,// is considered in the //śūdra// category. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya belonged to this //karaṇa// class; therefore he was considered a //śūdra.// He was also the governor of South India under the regime of Mahārāja Pratāparudra of Orissa. In other words, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya informed Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that Rāmānanda Rāya, although belonging to the //śūdra// class, was a highly responsible government officer. As far as spiritual advancement is concerned, materialists, politicians and //śūdras// are generally disqualified. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya therefore requested that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu not neglect Rāmānanda Rāya, who was highly advanced spiritually although he was born a //śūdra// and a materialist.

A //viṣayī// is one who is attached to family life and is interested only in wife, children and worldly sense gratification. The senses can be engaged either in worldly enjoyment or in the service of the Lord. Those who are not engaged in the service of the Lord and are interested only in material sense gratification are called //viṣayī.// Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya was engaged in government service, and he belonged to the //karaṇa// class. He was certainly not a //sannyāsī// in saffron cloth, yet he was in the transcendental position of a //paramahaṁsa// householder. Before becoming Caitanya Mahāprabhu's disciple, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya considered Rāmānanda Rāya an ordinary //viṣayī// because he was a householder engaged in government service. However, when the Bhaṭṭācārya was actually enlightened in Vaiṣṇava philosophy, he could understand the exalted transcendental position of Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya; therefore he referred to him as //adhikārī.// An //adhikārī// is one who knows the transcendental science of Kṛṣṇa and is engaged in His service; therefore all //gṛhastha// devotees are designated as //dāsa adhikārī.//
