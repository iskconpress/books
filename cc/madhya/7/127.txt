===== Purport =====

It is not advisable in this Age of Kali to leave one's family suddenly, for people are not trained as proper //brahmacārīs// and //gṛhasthas.// Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised the //brāhmaṇa// not to be too eager to give up family life. It would be better to remain with his family and try to become purified by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// regularly under the direction of a spiritual master. This is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If this principle is followed by everyone, there is no need to accept //sannyāsa.// In the next verse Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises everyone to become an ideal householder by offenselessly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and teaching the same principle to everyone he meets.
