===== Purport =====

The house of Vidyā-vācaspati was located at Vidyānagara, which was near Koladvīpa, or Kuliyā. It was here that Devānanda Paṇḍita was residing. This information is found in //Caitanya-bhāgavata (Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Twenty-one). In //Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka,// the following statement is given about Kuliyā. //Tataḥ kumārahaṭṭe śrīvāsa-paṇḍita-vāṭyām abhyāyayau:// "From there the Lord went to the house of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita in Kumārahaṭṭa." //Tato 'dvaita-vāṭīm abhyetya haridāsenābhivanditas tathaiva taraṇī-vartmanā navadvīpasya pāre kuliyā-nāma-grāme mādhava-dāsa-vāṭyām uttīrṇavān. evaṁ sapta-dināni tatra sthitvā punas taṭa-vartmanā eva calitavān:// "From the house of Śrīvāsa Ācārya, the Lord went to the house of Advaita Ācārya, where He was offered obeisances by Haridāsa Ṭhākura. The Lord then took a boat to the other side of Navadvīpa to a place called Kuliyā, where He stayed seven days at the house of Mādhava dāsa. He then proceeded along the banks of the Ganges."

In the //Śrī Caitanya-carita-mahā-kāvya,// it is stated, //anyedyuḥ sa śrī-navadvīpa-bhūmeḥ pāre gaṅgaṁ paścime kvāpi deśe, śrīmān sarva-prāṇināṁ tat-tad-aṅgair netrānandaṁ samyag āgatya tene:// "The Lord went to the eastern side of the Ganges at Navadvīpa, and everyone was pleased to see the Lord coming."

In the //Caitanya-bhāgavata (Antya-khaṇḍa,// Chapter Three), it is stated, //sarva-pāriṣada-saṅge śrī-gaurasundara ācambite āsi' uttarilā tāṅra ghara:// "The Lord suddenly came to Vidyānagara with a full party and stayed there in the house of Vidyā-vācaspati," //Navadvīpādi sarva-dike haila dhvani:// "Thus throughout Navadvīpa, the Lord's arrival was made known." //Vācaspati-ghare āilā nyāsi-cūḍāmaṇi:// "Thus the chief of all the //sannyāsīs,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, arrived at the house of Vidyā-vācaspati."

"When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed at Vidyā-vācaspati's house, many hundreds and thousands of people went to see Him and chant the holy name of Hari. It was so crowded that people could not even find a place to walk; therefore they made room by clearing out the jungles near the village. Many roads were automatically excavated, and many people also came by boat to see the Lord. So many came that it was difficult for the boatmen to get them across the river. When Vidyā-vācaspati suddenly arrived, he made arrangements for many boats to receive these people, but the people would not wait for the boats. Somehow or other they crossed the river and hurried toward the house of Vidyā-vācaspati. Due to this great crowd, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu secretly went to Kuliyā-nagara. After the Lord left Vidyānagara, however, all the people heard news of His leaving. They then accompanied Vācaspati to Kuliyā-nagara. Since the news of the Lord's arrival was immediately broadcast, large crowds arrived and greeted Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with great jubilation. Indeed, when the crowd went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it increased ten thousand times in number. No one could say how many people crossed the river to see Him, but many hundreds of thousands made a great tumult when crossing the River Ganges. After crossing the river, everyone began to embrace one another because they heard the good news of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's arrival. Thus all the inhabitants of Kuliyā, the sinful, intermediate, and spiritually advanced, were delivered and glorified by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu."

As stated in //Caitanya-bhāgavata (Antya-khaṇḍa,// Chapter Six):

> khānāyoḍā, baḍagāchi, āra dogāchiyā
> gaṅgāra opāra kabhu yāyena 'kuliyā'

As stated in //Caitanya-maṅgala://

> gaṅgā-snāna kari prabhu rāḍha-deśa diyā
> krame krame uttarilā nagara 'kuliyā'
>
> māyera vacane punaḥ gelā navadvīpa
> vārakoṇā-ghāṭa, nija vāḍīra samīpa

In the commentary of Premadāsa it is said:

> nadīyāra mājhakhāne, sakala lokete
> jāne, 'kuliyā-pāhāḍapura' nāme sthāna.

Śrī Narahari Cakravartī, or Ghanaśyāma dāsa, has written in his //Bhakti-ratnākara://

> kuliyā pāhāḍapura dekha śrīnivāsa
> pūrve 'koladvīpa'-parvatākhya---e pracāra

In a book named //Navadvīpa-parikrama,// also written by Ghanaśyāma dāsa, it is stated: //kuliyā-pāhāḍapura grāma pūrve koladvīpa-parvatākhyānanda nāma.// Therefore one can conclude that the present-day city of Navadvīpa and the places known as Bāhirdvīpa, Kolera Gañja, Kola-āmāda, Kolera Daha, Gadakhāli, etc. were known as Kuliyā, but the so-called Kuliyāra Pāṭa is not the original Kuliyā.
