From this we can understand that the Mohammedan governor was a drunkard (//madyapa).// Ordinarily, there was no chance that he would change, but Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could turn anyone's mind to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One can be delivered from material existence simply by remembering Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's holy name or by visiting Him. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being spread throughout the world, but not even one //yavana// or //mleccha// addicted to drinking could have changed and accepted Kṛṣṇa consciousness without Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's grace. People are often astonished to see many thousands of Westerners converted to Vaiṣṇavism. Generally Westerners are addicted to meat-eating, drinking, gambling and illicit sex; therefore their taking up Kṛṣṇa consciousness is astonishing. In India, especially, there is much astonishment at this. The answer, however, is given here: //darśana-smaraṇe yāṅra jagat tārila.// This change is made possible simply by the remembrance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Western devotees are very sincerely chanting the holy names of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates: //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// By the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates, people are being purified and their consciousness directed from //māyā// to Kṛṣṇa.

The word //viśvāsa// refers to a secretary. This title is generally found among the //kāyastha// caste in the Hindu community. In Bengal, the title //viśvāsa// is still used by the //kāyasthas.// The word //viśvāsa// means "faithful," and a //viśvāsī// is a person in whom one can place faith. Śrī Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that during the Mohammedan reign in Bengal, there was a secretariat entitled //viśvāsa-khānā.// The office of //viśvāsa-khānā// was a secretariat office in which only the most reliable people were employed. They were elected from the //kāyastha// community, a community that is still very expert in managing business and government affairs. The secretariat, or //viśvāsa-khānā,// is generally a very reliable and faithful servant. Whenever some confidential service was needed, these officers were employed.
