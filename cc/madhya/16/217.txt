===== Purport =====

Hiraṇya and Govardhana were inhabitants of Saptagrāma in the district of Hugalī. Actually they were inhabitants not of Saptagrāma, but a nearby village named Kṛṣṇapura. They took their birth in a big //kāyastha// family, and although their family title has not been ascertained, it is known that they came from an aristocratic family. The elder brother's name was Hiraṇya Majumadāra, and the younger brother's name was Govardhana Majumadāra. Śrī Raghunātha dāsa was the son of Govardhana Majumadāra. Their family priest was Balarāma Ācārya, who was a favorite of Haridāsa Ṭhākura's, and the family's spiritual master was Yadunandana Ācārya, a favorite of Vāsudeva Datta's.

The village of Saptagrāma is located on the eastern railway from Calcutta to Burdwan, and presently the railway station is called Triśabighā. In those days there was a large river there known as the Sarasvatī, and present-day Triśabighā is a great port. In 1592, the Pāṭhānas invaded, and due to a flooding of the Sarasvatī River in the year 1632, this great port was partially destroyed. It is said that in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, Portuguese businessmen used to come aboard their ships. In those days, Saptagrāma, situated on the southern side of Bengal, was very rich and popular. The merchants, who were the principal residents, were called Saptagrāma //suvarṇa-vaṇik.// There were very many rich people there, and Hiraṇya Majumadāra and Govardhana Majumadāra belonged to the //kāyastha// community. They also were very rich, so much so that it is mentioned in this verse that their annual income as landlords amounted to 1,200,000 rupees. In this connection, one may refer to //Ādi-līlā// (Chapter Eleven, verse 41), which describes Uddhāraṇa Datta, who also belonged to the Saptagrāmī //suvarṇa-vaṇik// community.
