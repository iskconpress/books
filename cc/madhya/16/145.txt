===== Purport =====

Lord Kṛṣṇa promised not to fight in the battle of Kurukṣetra or even take up a weapon. But when Bhīṣma wanted to keep his own promise to break the promise of the Lord, the Lord immediately got down from the chariot, and to make Bhīṣma's promise true He picked up a chariot wheel and rushed forward to kill him. This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:9:37|(1.9.37)]].
