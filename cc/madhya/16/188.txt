===== Purport =====

If one is purified by following Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's orders---that is, by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa-one must certainly be eager to render service to the Lord. This is the test. When one engages enthusiastically in the Lord's service, it is to be understood that he is reaping the results of chanting the names of Kṛṣṇa and Hari.
