===== Purport =====

When Raghunātha dāsa's father and mother saw that their son was no longer acting like a crazy fellow and was responsibly attending to his duties, they became very happy. The eleven people-five watchmen, four personal servants and two //brāhmaṇas-//who were guarding him became less strict in their vigilance. When Raghunātha dāsa actually took up his household affairs, his parents reduced the number of guards.
