**The Lord stayed at Rāghava Paṇḍita's place for only one day. The next morning, He went to Kumārahaṭṭa, where Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura lived.**

===== Purport =====

The present name of Kumārahaṭṭa is Hālisahara. After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa,// Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura-due to separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu-left Navadvīpa and went to Hālisahara to live.

From Kumārahaṭṭa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Kāñcanapallī (known as Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā), where Śivānanda Sena lived. After staying two days at Śivānanda's house, the Lord went to the house of Vāsudeva Datta. From there He went to the western side of Navadvīpa to the village called Vidyānagara. From Vidyānagara He went to Kuliyā-grāma and stayed at Mādhava dāsa's house. He stayed there one week and excused the offenses of Devānanda and others. Due to Kavirāja Gosvāmī's mentioning the name of Śāntipurācārya, some people think that Kuliyā is a village near Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā. Due to this mistaken idea, they invented another place known as New Kuliyāra Pāṭa. Actually such a place does not exist. Leaving the house of Vāsudeva Datta, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the house of Advaita Ācārya. From there He went to the western side of Navadvīpa to Vidyānagara and stayed at the house of Vidyā-vācaspati. These accounts are given in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata, Caitanya-maṅgala, Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka// and //Caitanya-carita-kāvya.// Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī has not vividly described this entire tour; therefore, on the basis of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// some unscrupulous people have invented a place called Kuliyāra Pāṭa near Kāṅcaḍāpāḍā.
