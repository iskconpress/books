**When Gadādhara Paṇḍita started to go with the Lord, he was forbidden to come and was asked not to give up the vow of kṣetra-sannyāsa.**

===== Purport =====

When one takes //kṣetra-sannyāsa,// he leaves his household life and goes to a place of pilgrimage devoted to Lord Viṣṇu. Such places include Puruṣottama (Jagannātha Purī), Navadvīpa-dhāma and Mathurā-dhāma. The //kṣetra-sannyāsī// lives in these places alone or with his family. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura considers //kṣetra-sannyāsa// to be the preferable //vānaprastha// situation in this Age of Kali. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya lived in this way, and he has been called a //kṣetra-sannyāsī---//that is, a //sannyāsī// living in Jagannātha Purī.
