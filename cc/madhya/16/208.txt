Mādhava dāsa is identified as follows. In the family of Śrīkara Caṭṭopādhyāya, Yudhiṣṭhira Caṭṭopādhyāya took his birth. Formerly, he and his family members lived in Bilvagrāma and Pāṭūli. From there he went to Kuliyā Pāhāḍapura, formerly known as Pāḍapura. The eldest son of Yudhiṣṭhira Caṭṭopādhyāya is known as Mādhava dāsa, the second son was called Haridāsa, and the youngest son was called Kṛṣṇasampatti Caṭṭopādhyāya. The three brothers' nicknames were Chakaḍi, Tinakaḍi and Dukaḍi. The grandson of Mādhava dāsa was named Vaṁśīvadana, and his grandson Rāmacandra and their descendants are still living at Vāghnāpāḍā, or Vaiñcī.
