~~Title:Cc. Madhya 25: How All the Residents of Vārāṇasī Became Vaiṣṇavas~~

====== How All the Residents of Vārāṇasī Became Vaiṣṇavas ======

The following is a summary of Chapter Twenty-five. A Mahārāṣṭrian //brāhmaṇa// who was living in Benares was a great devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was always very happy to hear of the glories of the Lord, and it was by his arrangement that all the //sannyāsīs// of Vārāṇasī became devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He invited all the //sannyāsīs// to his house to meet Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this incident has been described in the Seventh Chapter of //Ādi-līlā.// From that day, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became famous in the city of Vārāṇasī, and many important men in that city became His followers. By and by, one of the disciples of the great //sannyāsī// Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī became devoted to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this devotee explained Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and supported His views with various arguments.

One day Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to take a bath at Pañca-nada, and afterwards all His devotees began chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// in front of the temple of Bindu Mādhava. At this time Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī and all his devotees approached the Lord. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī immediately fell down at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and very much regretted his past behavior toward the Lord. He asked Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu about devotional service in terms of the //Vedānta-sūtra,// and the Lord told him about devotional service that is approved by great personalities who know the //Vedānta-sūtra.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then pointed out that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the proper commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra.// He then explained the //catuḥ-ślokī// (four //ślokas//) of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the essence of that great scripture.

From that day on, all the //sannyāsīs// of Vārāṇasī became devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Before returning to His headquarters at Jagannātha Purī, the Lord advised Sanātana Gosvāmī to go to Vṛndāvana. The Lord then departed for Jagannātha Purī. Kavirāja Gosvāmī then describes something about Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Subuddhi Rāya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Jagannātha Purī through the great forest of Jhārikhaṇḍa in central India. At the end of this chapter, Kavirāja Gosvāmī sums up the incidents of //Madhya-līlā// and instructs every living being to read this sublime book of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes.

  ; [[.25:1|Cc. Madhya 25.1]]
  : After converting into Vaiṣṇavas all the residents of Vārāṇasī, who were headed by the sannyāsīs, and after completely educating and instructing Sanātana Gosvāmī at Vārāṇasī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to Jagannātha Purī.

  ; [[.25:2|Cc. Madhya 25.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Caitanya! All glories to Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Advaitacandra! And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.25:3|Cc. Madhya 25.3]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī in all the conclusions of devotional service for two consecutive months.

  ; [[.25:4|Cc. Madhya 25.4]]
  : For as long as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in Vārāṇasī, Paramānanda Kīrtanīyā, who was a friend of Candraśekhara's, chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and other songs to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in a very humorous way.

  ; [[.25:5|Cc. Madhya 25.5]]
  : When the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs at Vārāṇasī criticized Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord's devotees became very depressed. To satisfy them, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed His mercy to the sannyāsīs.

  ; [[.25:6|Cc. Madhya 25.6]]
  : In the Seventh Chapter of Ādi-līlā I have already elaborately described Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's deliverance of the sannyāsīs at Vārāṇasī, but I shall briefly repeat it in this chapter.

  ; [[.25:7|Cc. Madhya 25.7]]
  : When the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs were criticizing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu anywhere and everywhere in Vārāṇasī, the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa, hearing this blasphemy, began to think about this unhappily.

  ; [[.25:8|Cc. Madhya 25.8]]
  : The Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa thought, "Whoever closely sees the characteristics of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately realizes His personality and accepts Him as the Supreme Lord.

  ; [[.25:9|Cc. Madhya 25.9]]
  : "If by some means I can assemble all the sannyāsīs together, they will certainly become His devotees after seeing His personal characteristics.

  ; [[.25:10|Cc. Madhya 25.10]]
  : "I shall have to reside at Vārāṇasī the rest of my life. If I do not try to carry out this plan, I shall certainly continue to suffer mental depression."

  ; [[.25:11|Cc. Madhya 25.11]]
  : Thinking like this, the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa extended an invitation to all the sannyāsīs of Vārāṇasī. After doing this, he finally approached Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to extend Him an invitation.

  ; [[.25:12|Cc. Madhya 25.12]]
  : At this time, Candraśekhara and Tapana Miśra both heard blasphemous criticism against Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and felt very unhappy. They came to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's lotus feet to submit a request.

  ; [[.25:13|Cc. Madhya 25.13]]
  : They submitted their request, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, seeing His devotees' unhappiness, decided to turn the minds of the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs.

  ; [[.25:14|Cc. Madhya 25.14]]
  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was seriously considering meeting with the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa approached Him and extended an invitation. The brāhmaṇa submitted his invitation with great humility, and he touched the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.25:15|Cc. Madhya 25.15]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted his invitation, and the next day, after finishing His noontime activities, He went to the brāhmaṇa's house.

  ; [[.25:16|Cc. Madhya 25.16]]
  : I have already described Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's deliverance of the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs in the Seventh Chapter when I described the glories of the Pañca-tattva-Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, Gadādhara Prabhu and Śrīvāsa.

  ; [[.25:17|Cc. Madhya 25.17]]
  : Since I have already described this incident very elaborately in the Seventh Chapter of Ādi-līlā, I do not wish to increase the size of this book by giving another description. However, I shall try to include in this chapter whatever was not described there.

  ; [[.25:18|Cc. Madhya 25.18]]
  : Beginning from the day on which Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed His mercy to the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs, there were vivid discussions about this conversion among the inhabitants of Vārāṇasī.

  ; [[.25:19|Cc. Madhya 25.19]]
  : Crowds of people came to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu from that day on, and scholars of various scriptures discussed different subject matters with the Lord.

  ; [[.25:20|Cc. Madhya 25.20]]
  : When people came to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to discuss the principles of various scriptures, the Lord defeated their false conclusions and established the predominance of devotional service to the Lord. With logic and argument He very politely changed their minds.

  ; [[.25:21|Cc. Madhya 25.21]]
  : As soon as people received instructions from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they began to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. Thus everyone laughed, chanted and danced with the Lord.

  ; [[.25:22|Cc. Madhya 25.22]]
  : All the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs offered their obeisances unto Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and then began to discuss His movement, giving up their studies of Vedānta and Māyāvāda philosophy.

  ; [[.25:23|Cc. Madhya 25.23]]
  : One of the disciples of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, who was as learned as his guru, began to speak in that assembly, offering all respects to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.25:24|Cc. Madhya 25.24]]
  : He said, "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa Himself. When He explains the Vedānta-sūtra, He does so very nicely.

  ; [[.25:25|Cc. Madhya 25.25]]
  : "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explains the direct meaning of the Upaniṣads. When all learned scholars hear this, their minds and ears are satisfied.

  ; [[.25:26|Cc. Madhya 25.26]]
  : "Giving up the direct meaning of the Vedānta-sūtra and the Upaniṣads, Śaṅkarācārya imagines some other interpretation.

  ; [[.25:27|Cc. Madhya 25.27]]
  : "All the interpretations of Śaṅkarācārya are imaginary. Such imaginary interpretations are verbally accepted by learned scholars, but they do not appeal to the heart.

  ; [[.25:28|Cc. Madhya 25.28]]
  : "The words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu are firm and convincing, and I accept them as true. In this Age of Kali, one cannot be delivered from material clutches simply by formally accepting the renounced order.

  ; [[.25:29|Cc. Madhya 25.29]]
  : "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's explanation of the verse beginning 'harer nāma harer nāma' is not only pleasing to the ear but is strong, factual evidence.

  ; [[.25:30|Cc. Madhya 25.30]]
  : "In this Age of Kali, one cannot attain liberation without taking to the devotional service of the Lord. In this age, even if one does not chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa perfectly, he still attains liberation very easily.

  ; [[.25:31|Cc. Madhya 25.31]]
  : " 'My dear Lord, devotional service unto You is the only auspicious path. If one gives it up simply for speculative knowledge or the understanding that these living beings are spirit soul and the material world is false, he undergoes a great deal of trouble. He only gains troublesome and inauspicious activities. His actions are like beating a husk that is already devoid of rice. One's labor becomes fruitless.'

  ; [[.25:32|Cc. Madhya 25.32]]
  : " 'O lotus-eyed one, those who think they are liberated in this life but who are devoid of devotional service to You are of impure intelligence. Although they accept severe austerities and penances and rise to the spiritual position, to impersonal Brahman realization, they fall down again because they neglect to worship Your lotus feet.'

  ; [[.25:33|Cc. Madhya 25.33]]
  : "The word Brahman means 'the greatest.' This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in all six opulences. However, if we take the one-sided impersonalist view, His fullness is diminished.

  ; [[.25:34|Cc. Madhya 25.34]]
  : "Vedic literatures, the Upaniṣads, the Brahma-sūtra and the Purāṇas all describe the activities of the spiritual potency of the Lord. If one cannot accept the personal activities of the Lord, he jokes foolishly and gives an impersonal description.

  ; [[.25:35|Cc. Madhya 25.35]]
  : "The Māyāvādīs do not recognize the personal form of the Lord as spiritual and full of bliss. This is a great sin. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's statements are actually factual.

  ; [[.25:36|Cc. Madhya 25.36]]
  : " 'O supreme one, the transcendental form I am now seeing is full of transcendental bliss. It is not contaminated by the external energy. It is full of effulgence. My Lord, there is no better understanding of You than this. You are the Supreme Soul and the creator of this material world, but You are not connected with this material world. You are completely different from created form and variety. I sincerely take shelter of that form of Yours which I am now seeing. This form is the original source of all living beings and their senses.'

  ; [[.25:37|Cc. Madhya 25.37]]
  : " 'Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of all causes. He is past, present and future, and He is the movable and immovable. He is the greatest and the smallest, and He is visible and directly experienced. He is celebrated in Vedic literature. Everything is Kṛṣṇa, and without Him there is no existence. He is the root of all understanding, and He is that which is understood by all words.'

  ; [[.25:38|Cc. Madhya 25.38]]
  : " 'O most auspicious one! For our benefit You are worshiped by us. You manifest Your transcendental form, which You show to us in our meditation. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Person, and we worship You whom impersonalists do not accept due to their poor fund of knowledge. Thus they are liable to descend into a hellish condition.'

  ; [[.25:39|Cc. Madhya 25.39]]
  : " 'Fools disrespect Me because I appear like a human being. They do not know My supreme position as the cause of all causes, the creator of the material energy.'

  ; [[.25:40|Cc. Madhya 25.40]]
  : " 'Those who are envious of My form, who are cruel and mischievous and lowest among men, are perpetually cast by Me into hellish existence in various demoniac species of life.'

  ; [[.25:41|Cc. Madhya 25.41]]
  : "Not accepting the transformation of energy, Śrīpād Śaṅkarācārya has tried to establish the theory of illusion under the plea that Vyāsadeva has made a mistake.

  ; [[.25:42|Cc. Madhya 25.42]]
  : "Śrīpād Śaṅkarācārya has given his interpretation and imaginary meaning. It does not actually appeal to the mind of any sane man. He has done this to convince the atheists and bring them under his control.

  ; [[.25:43|Cc. Madhya 25.43]]
  : "The atheists, headed by the Māyāvādī philosophers, do not care for liberation or Kṛṣṇa's mercy. They simply continue to put forward false arguments and counter---theories to atheistic philosophy, not considering or engaging in spiritual matters.

  ; [[.25:44|Cc. Madhya 25.44]]
  : "The conclusion is that the import of the Vedānta-sūtra is covered by the imaginary explanation of Śaṅkarācārya. Whatever Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said is perfectly true.

  ; [[.25:45|Cc. Madhya 25.45]]
  : "Whatever meaning Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gives is perfect. Any other interpretation is only a distortion."

  ; [[.25:46|Cc. Madhya 25.46]]
  : After saying this, the disciple of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī began to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Hearing this, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī made the following statement.

  ; [[.25:47|Cc. Madhya 25.47]]
  : Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī said, "Śaṅkarācārya was very eager to establish the philosophy of monism. Therefore he explained Vedānta-sūtra, or Vedānta philosophy, in a different way to support monistic philosophy.

  ; [[.25:48|Cc. Madhya 25.48]]
  : "If one accepts the Personality of Godhead, the philosophy that maintains that God and the living entity are one cannot be established. Therefore Śaṅkarācārya argued against and refuted all kinds of revealed scriptures.

  ; [[.25:49|Cc. Madhya 25.49]]
  : "Anyone who wants to establish his own opinion or philosophy certainly cannot explain any scripture according to the principle of direct interpretation.

  ; [[.25:50|Cc. Madhya 25.50]]
  : "The Mīmāṁsaka philosophers conclude that if there is a God, He is subjected to our fruitive activities. Similarly, the Sāṅkhya philosophers who analyze the cosmic manifestation say that the cause of the cosmos is material nature.

  ; [[.25:51|Cc. Madhya 25.51]]
  : "The followers of nyāya, the philosophy of logic, maintain that the atom is the cause of the cosmic manifestation, and the Māyāvādī philosophers maintain that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is the cause of the cosmic manifestation.

  ; [[.25:52|Cc. Madhya 25.52]]
  : "The Pātañjala philosophers say that when one is self-realized, he understands the Lord. Similarly, according to the Vedas and Vedic principles, the original cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

  ; [[.25:53|Cc. Madhya 25.53]]
  : "After studying the six philosophical theses, Vyāsadeva completely summarized them all in the codes of Vedānta philosophy.

  ; [[.25:54|Cc. Madhya 25.54]]
  : "According to Vedānta philosophy, the Absolute Truth is a person. When the word nirguṇa [without qualities] is used, it is to be understood that the Lord has attributes that are totally spiritual.

  ; [[.25:55|Cc. Madhya 25.55]]
  : "Of the philosophers mentioned, none really cares for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. They are always busy refuting the philosophical theories of others and establishing their own.

  ; [[.25:56|Cc. Madhya 25.56]]
  : "By studying the six philosophical theories, one cannot reach the Absolute Truth. It is therefore our duty to follow the path of the mahājanas, the authorities. Whatever they say should be accepted as the supreme truth.

  ; [[.25:57|Cc. Madhya 25.57]]
  : " 'Dry arguments are inconclusive. A great personality whose opinion does not differ from others is not considered a great sage. Simply by studying the Vedas, which are variegated, one cannot come to the right path by which religious principles are understood. The solid truth of religious principles is hidden in the heart of an unadulterated self-realized person. Consequently, as the śāstras confirm, one should accept whatever progressive path the mahājanas advocate.'

  ; [[.25:58|Cc. Madhya 25.58]]
  : "The words of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are a shower of nectar. Whatever He concludes to be the ultimate truth is indeed the summum bonum of all spiritual knowledge."

  ; [[.25:59|Cc. Madhya 25.59]]
  : After hearing all these statements, the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa very jubilantly went to inform Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.25:60|Cc. Madhya 25.60]]
  : When the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa went to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Lord was going to the temple of Bindu Mādhava after bathing in the waters of Pañca-nada.

  ; [[.25:61|Cc. Madhya 25.61]]
  : While the Lord was on His way, the Mahārāṣṭrian brāhmaṇa informed Him about the incident that took place in the camp of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. Hearing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled happily.

  ; [[.25:62|Cc. Madhya 25.62]]
  : Upon reaching the temple of Bindu Mādhava, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, seeing the beauty of Lord Bindu Mādhava, became overwhelmed in ecstatic love. He then began to dance in the courtyard of the temple.

  ; [[.25:63|Cc. Madhya 25.63]]
  : There were four people accompanying Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and these were Candraśekhara, Paramānanda Purī, Tapana Miśra and Sanātana Gosvāmī. They were all chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra in the following way.

  ; [[.25:64|Cc. Madhya 25.64]]
  : They chanted, "Haraye namaḥ kṛṣṇa yādavāya namaḥ gopāla govinda rāma śrī-madhusūdana."

  ; [[.25:65|Cc. Madhya 25.65]]
  : In all directions, hundreds and thousands of people began to chant "Hari! Hari!" Thus there arose a tumultuous and auspicious sound filling the entire universe.

  ; [[.25:66|Cc. Madhya 25.66]]
  : When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, who was staying nearby, heard this tumultuous chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, he and his disciples immediately came to see the Lord.

  ; [[.25:67|Cc. Madhya 25.67]]
  : When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī saw the Lord, he and his disciples also joined the chanting with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was charmed by the Lord's dancing and ecstatic love and by the transcendental beauty of His body.

  ; [[.25:68|Cc. Madhya 25.68]]
  : Ecstatic spiritual transformations began to take place in the Lord's body. His body trembled, and His voice faltered. He perspired, turned pale and wept a constant flow of tears, which wet all the people standing there. The eruptions on the Lord's body appeared like kadamba flowers.

  ; [[.25:69|Cc. Madhya 25.69]]
  : All the people were astonished to see the Lord's jubilation and humility and to hear Him talk in ecstasy. Indeed, all the residents of Benares [Kāśī] saw the bodily transformations and were astonished.

  ; [[.25:70|Cc. Madhya 25.70]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu regained His external consciousness, He saw that many Māyāvādī sannyāsīs and other people were gathered there. He therefore suspended His dancing for the time being.

  ; [[.25:71|Cc. Madhya 25.71]]
  : After stopping the kīrtana, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is a great example of humility, offered prayers unto the feet of Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. At this, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī immediately came forward and clasped the Lord's lotus feet.

  ; [[.25:72|Cc. Madhya 25.72]]
  : When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī caught hold of the Lord's lotus feet, the Lord said, "My dear sir, you are the spiritual master of the whole world; therefore you are most worshipable. As far as I am concerned, I am not even on the level of the disciple of your disciple."

  ; [[.25:73|Cc. Madhya 25.73]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "You are a great, spiritually advanced personality, and therefore you cannot worship a person like Me. I am far inferior. If you do so, My spiritual power will be diminished, for you are as good as the impersonal Brahman.

  ; [[.25:74|Cc. Madhya 25.74]]
  : "My dear sir, for you everyone is on the level of impersonal Brahman, but for the enlightenment of people in general you should not behave in that way."

  ; [[.25:75|Cc. Madhya 25.75]]
  : Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī replied, "Formerly I have committed many offenses against You by blaspheming You, but now the effects of my offenses are counteracted by my touching Your lotus feet.

  ; [[.25:76|Cc. Madhya 25.76]]
  : " 'If a person considered liberated in this life commits offenses against the reservoir of inconceivable potencies, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he will again fall down and desire the material atmosphere for material enjoyment.'

  ; [[.25:77|Cc. Madhya 25.77]]
  : " 'Being touched by the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, that serpent was immediately freed from the reactions of his sinful life. Thus the serpent gave up his body and assumed the body of a beautiful Vidyādhara demigod.' "

  ; [[.25:78|Cc. Madhya 25.78]]
  : When Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī supported himself by quoting the verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately protested by uttering the holy name of Lord Viṣṇu. The Lord then presented Himself as a most fallen living entity, and He said, "If someone accepts a fallen conditioned soul as Viṣṇu, Bhagavān, or an incarnation, he commits a great offense."

  ; [[.25:79|Cc. Madhya 25.79]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "To say nothing of ordinary living entities, even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva cannot be considered on the level of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa. If one considers them as such, he is immediately considered an offender and atheist.

  ; [[.25:80|Cc. Madhya 25.80]]
  : " 'A person who considers demigods like Brahmā and Śiva to be on an equal level with Nārāyaṇa is to be considered an offender, a pāṣaṇḍī.' "

  ; [[.25:81|Cc. Madhya 25.81]]
  : Prakāśānanda replied, "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa Himself. Nonetheless, You are considering Yourself His eternal servant.

  ; [[.25:82|Cc. Madhya 25.82]]
  : "My dear Lord, You are the Supreme Lord, and although You consider Yourself the Lord's servant, You are nonetheless worshipable. You are much greater than I am; therefore all my spiritual achievements have been lost because I have blasphemed You.

  ; [[.25:83|Cc. Madhya 25.83]]
  : " 'O great sage, out of many millions of materially liberated people who are free from ignorance, and out of many millions of siddhas who have nearly attained perfection, there is hardly one pure devotee of Nārāyaṇa. Only such a devotee is actually completely satisfied and peaceful.'

  ; [[.25:84|Cc. Madhya 25.84]]
  : " 'When a person mistreats great souls, his life span, opulence, reputation, religion, possessions and good fortune are all destroyed.'

  ; [[.25:85|Cc. Madhya 25.85]]
  : " 'Unless human society accepts the dust of the lotus feet of great mahātmās-devotees who have nothing to do with material possessions-mankind cannot turn its attention to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Those lotus feet vanquish all the unwanted miserable conditions of material life.'

  ; [[.25:86|Cc. Madhya 25.86]]
  : "Henceforward I shall certainly develop devotional service unto Your lotus feet. For this reason I have come to You and have fallen down at Your lotus feet."

  ; [[.25:87|Cc. Madhya 25.87]]
  : After saying this, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī sat down with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and began to question the Lord as follows.

  ; [[.25:88|Cc. Madhya 25.88]]
  : Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī said, "We can understand the faults You have pointed out in the Māyāvāda philosophy. All the explanations given by Śaṅkarācārya are imaginary.

  ; [[.25:89|Cc. Madhya 25.89]]
  : "My dear Lord, whatever direct meaning You have given when explaining the Brahma-sūtra is certainly very wonderful to all of us.

  ; [[.25:90|Cc. Madhya 25.90]]
  : "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore You have inconceivable energies. I wish to hear from You briefly about the Brahma-sūtra."

  ; [[.25:91|Cc. Madhya 25.91]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "I am an ordinary living being, and therefore my knowledge is very insignificant. However, the meaning of the Brahma-sūtra is very grave because its author, Vyāsadeva, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.

  ; [[.25:92|Cc. Madhya 25.92]]
  : "The purpose of the Vedānta-sūtra is very difficult for an ordinary person to understand, but Vyāsadeva, out of his causeless mercy, has personally explained the meaning.

  ; [[.25:93|Cc. Madhya 25.93]]
  : "If the Vedānta-sūtra is explained by Vyāsadeva himself, who has written it, its original meaning can be understood by the people in general.

  ; [[.25:94|Cc. Madhya 25.94]]
  : "The meaning of the sound vibration oṁkāra is present in the Gāyatrī mantra. The same is elaborately explained in the four ślokas of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam known as catuḥ-ślokī.

  ; [[.25:193|Cc. Madhya 25.193]]
  : This became a perplexing problem for him because his wife kept requesting him to kill Subuddhi Rāya. Finally the Nawab sprinkled a little water on Subuddhi Rāya's head from a pitcher that had been used by a Mohammedan.

  ; [[.25:194|Cc. Madhya 25.194]]
  : Taking the Nawab's sprinkling water upon him as an opportunity, Subuddhi Rāya left his family and business affairs and went to Vārāṇasī.

  ; [[.25:274|Cc. Madhya 25.274]]
  : The devotees who have a relationship with Kṛṣṇa are like the swans and cakravāka birds that play in the forest of lotus flowers.

  : The pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are full of nectar, and the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa are like camphor. When one mixes these, they taste very sweet. By the mercy of the pure devotees, whoever tastes them can understand the depths of that sweetness.

  ; [[.25:278|Cc. Madhya 25.278]]
  : Men become strong and stout by eating sufficient grains, but the devotee who simply eats ordinary grains but does not taste the transcendental pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa gradually becomes weak and falls down from the transcendental position. However, if one drinks but a drop of the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, his body and mind begin to bloom, and he begins to laugh, sing and dance.

  ; [[.25:279|Cc. Madhya 25.279]]
  : The readers should relish this wonderful nectar because nothing compares to it. Keeping their faith firmly fixed within their minds, they should be careful not to fall into the pit of false arguments or the whirlpools of unfortunate situations. If one falls into such positions, he is finished.

  ; [[.25:280|Cc. Madhya 25.280]]
  : In conclusion, I submit to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, and all the other devotees and readers that I accept your lotus feet as the helmet on my head. In this way, all my purposes will be served.

Thus I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, humbly try to describe the nectar of the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, which are mixed with the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.25:282|Cc. Madhya 25.282]]
  : For the satisfaction of Śrī Madana-gopāla and Govindadeva, we pray that this book, Caitanya-caritāmṛta, may be offered to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.25:283|Cc. Madhya 25.283]]
  : The Caitanya-caritāmṛta pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu constitute a very secret literature. It is the life and soul of all devotees. Those who are not fit to relish this literature, who are envious like hogs and pigs, will certainly not adore it. However, this will not harm my attempt. These pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will certainly please all saintly people who have clear hearts. They will certainly enjoy it. We wish that this will enhance their enjoyment more and more.
