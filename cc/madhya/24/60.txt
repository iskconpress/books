===== Translation =====

**"When the devotee somehow or other always remembers the Supreme Personality of Godhead anywhere and everywhere, Lord Hari takes away life's four miserable conditions.**

===== Purport =====

The four miserable conditions are due to the four kinds of sinful activities, known as (1) //pātaka,// (2) //urupātaka,// (3) //mahā-pātaka// and (4) //atipātaka-//preliminary sin, very great sin, greater sin and topmost sin. However, Kṛṣṇa assures the devotee, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:// "I will protect you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear." The word //sarva-pāpebhyaḥ// indicates four kinds of sinful activity. As soon as the devotee surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, he is certainly relieved from all sinful activities and their results. The four basic sinful activities are summarized as illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating.
