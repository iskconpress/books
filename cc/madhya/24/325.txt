Actually Sanātana Gosvāmī belonged to a very respectable //brāhmaṇa// family. Nonetheless, he submitted himself as a fallen, lowborn person because he had served in the Mohammedan government. A //brāhmaṇa// is never supposed to be engaged for anyone's service. Accepting service for a livelihood (//paricaryātmakaṁ karma//) is the business of //śūdras.// The //brāhmaṇa// is always independent and busy studying //śāstra// and preaching //śāstra// to subordinate social members such as //kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas.// Sanātana Gosvāmī felt unfit to write Vaiṣṇava //smṛti// about the behavior of Vaiṣṇavas because he had fallen from the brahminical position. Thus Sanātana Gosvāmī clearly admits that the brahminical culture should be standardized. Presently in India, so-called //brāhmaṇas// are almost all engaged in some mundane service, and they do not understand the import of the Vedic //śāstras.// Nonetheless, they are passing themselves off as //brāhmaṇas// on the basis of birth. In this connection, Sanātana Gosvāmī declares that a //brāhmaṇa// cannot be engaged in anyone's service if he wants to take a leading part in society. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// Nārada Muni states that even if a //brāhmaṇa// is in a difficult position, he should not accept the occupation of a //śūdra.// This means that he should not be engaged in service for another, for this is the business of dogs. Under the circumstances, Sanātana Gosvāmī felt very low because he had accepted the service of the Muslim government. The conclusion is that no one should claim to be a //brāhmaṇa// simply by birthright while engaging in someone else's service.
