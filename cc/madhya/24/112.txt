===== Purport =====

Highly elevated Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// sometimes worship the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity and discuss the pastimes of the Lord, but their purpose is not elevation to Goloka Vṛndāvana. They want to merge into the Lord's effulgence. This statement is quoted from Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on the //Upaniṣad// known as //Nṛsiṁha-tāpanī.//
