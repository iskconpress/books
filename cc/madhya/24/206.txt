{{description>" 'This land Vṛndāvana [Vrajabhūmi] is glorified today. Your lotus feet have touched the earth and grass. Your fingers have touched the trees and creepers, and Your merciful eyes have glanced upon rivers, hills, birds and beasts. The gopīs have been embraced by Your arms, and even the goddess of fortune desires this. Now all of these are glorified.'}}
