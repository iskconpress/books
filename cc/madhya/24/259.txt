**"Nārada Muni then advised the hunter, 'Return home and distribute whatever riches you have to the pure brāhmaṇas who know the Absolute Truth. After distributing all your riches to the brāhmaṇas, both you and your wife should leave home, taking only one cloth to wear.'**

===== Purport =====

This is the process of renunciation at the stage of //vānaprastha.// After enjoying householder life for some time, the husband and wife must leave home and distribute their riches to //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas. One can keep his wife as an assistant in the //vānaprastha// stage. The idea is that the wife will assist the husband in spiritual advancement. Therefore Nārada Muni advised the hunter to adopt the //vānaprastha// stage and leave home. It is not that a //gṛhastha// should live at home until he dies. //Vānaprastha// is preliminary to //sannyāsa.// In the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there are many young couples engaged in the Lord's service. Eventually they are supposed to take //vānaprastha,// and after the //vānaprastha// stage the husband may take //sannyāsa// in order to preach. The wife may then remain alone and serve the Deity or engage in other activities within the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.
