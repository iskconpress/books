{{description>" 'Dear Kṛṣṇa, we have simply surrendered ourselves as Your maidservants, for we have seen Your beautiful face decorated with tresses of hair, Your earrings falling upon Your cheeks and the nectar of Your lips. We have also seen the beauty of Your smile and have been embraced by Your arms, which give us courage. Because we have seen Your chest, which is beautiful and broad, we have surrendered ourselves.'}}

This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.29.39) was spoken by the //gopīs// when they arrived near Kṛṣṇa for the //rāsa// dance on a full moonlit night. The attracted //gopīs// were awestruck, and they began to speak about how they came to Kṛṣṇa to enjoy the //rāsa// dance.
