{{description>" 'Those who discuss the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa are on the highest platform of devotional life, and they evince the symptoms of tears in the eyes and bodily jubilation. Such persons discharge devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without practicing the rules and regulations of the mystic yoga system. They possess all spiritual qualities, and they are elevated to the Vaikuṇṭha planets, which exist above us.'}}

This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:15:25|(3.15.25)]]. In this verse Lord Brahmā is speaking to all the demigods, who feared the two //asuras// in Diti's womb. Lord Brahmā described the Kumāras' visit to Vaikuṇṭha, and this was again explained by Maitreya, the friend of Vyāsadeva, when he gave instructions to Vidura.
