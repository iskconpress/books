===== Purport =====

One cannot write on spiritual matters without being blessed by Kṛṣṇa and the disciplic succession of //gurus.// The blessings of the authorities are one's power of attorney. One should not try to write anything about Vaiṣṇava behavior and activities without being authorized by superior authorities. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā: evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.//
