{{description>" 'When one is in ecstatic love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's heart is melted by bhakti-yoga, and one feels transcendental bliss. There are bodily symptoms manifest, and, due to eagerness, there are tears in the eyes. Thus one is subjected to spiritual bliss. When the heart is overly afflicted, the meditative mind, like a fishing hook, is gradually separated from the object of meditation.'}}
