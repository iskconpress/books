{{description>" 'My dear friend, both Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma are passing through the forest leading Their cows with Their cowherd boy friends. They both carry ropes with which, at the time of milking, They bind the rear legs of the cows. When They play on Their flutes, all moving living entities are stunned, and nonmoving living entities experience ecstatic jubilation by Their sweet music. All these things are certainly very wonderful.'}}

This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.21.19). All the //gopīs// were very attracted to Kṛṣṇa when they saw Him wandering in the forest with Baladeva. They thus praised the Lord's activities.
