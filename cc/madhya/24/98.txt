This is a verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:10:11|(1.10.11)]]. All the members of the Kuru dynasty offered respects when Kṛṣṇa was leaving Hastināpura after the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa was going to His own kingdom, and all the members of the Kuru dynasty were overwhelmed by His departure. This verse was spoken in that connection by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. A pure devotee becomes attached to Kṛṣṇa by hearing the Lord's glories. The Lord's glories and the Lord Himself are identical. One has to be qualified to understand this Absolute Truth; therefore one should be given a chance to associate with a pure devotee. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for this purpose. We want to create pure devotees so that other people will benefit by their association. In this way the number of pure devotees increases. Professional preachers cannot create pure devotees. There are many professional preachers of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// who read this work to earn their livelihood. However, they cannot convert materialistic people to devotional service. Only a pure devotee can convert others to pure devotional service. It is therefore important for all the preachers in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to first become pure devotees and follow the regulative principles, refraining from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They should regularly chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// on their beads, follow the devotional process, rise early in the morning, attend //maṅgala-ārati// and recite //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Bhagavad-gītā// regularly. In this way, one can become purified and free from all material contamination.

To make a show of devotional service will not help one. One must be a pure devotee following the devotional process; then one can convert others to devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu practiced devotional service and preached (//āpani ācari' bhakti karila pracāra//). If a preacher behaves properly in devotional service, he will be able to convert others. Otherwise, his preaching will have no effect.
