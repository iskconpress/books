**"Saintly persons who are always meditating upon Kṛṣṇa are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. The ātmārāmas are also engaged in the Lord's service. That is the indirect import.**

===== Purport =====

The //anvācaye// meaning of the word //ca// indicates that between the two words compounded by the word //ca,// one is given more importance, and the other is considered subordinate. For example: "O //brahmacārī,// please go out and collect alms and at the same time bring in the cows." In this statement, the collection of alms is of first importance, and the second business of collecting the cows is subordinate. Similarly, one who always meditates upon Kṛṣṇa is mainly a devotee of Kṛṣṇa engaged in His devotional service. Other //ātmārāmas// are subordinate in devotional service.
