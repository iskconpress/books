===== Purport =====

It is the duty of the public to present a gift to a saintly person, Vaiṣṇava or //brāhmaṇa// when going to see him. Every Vaiṣṇava is dependent on Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is ready to supply all of life's necessities, provided a Vaiṣṇava follows the principles set forth by the spiritual master. There are certainly many householders in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They join the movement and live in the society's centers, but if they take advantage of this opportunity and do not work but live at the expense of the movement, eating //prasāda// and simply sleeping, they place themselves in a very dangerous position. It is therefore advised that //gṛhasthas// should not live in the temple. They must live outside the temple and maintain themselves. Of course, if the //gṛhasthas// are fully engaged in the Lord's service according to the directions of the authorities, there is no harm in their living in a temple. In any case, a temple should not be a place to eat and sleep. A temple manager should be very careful about these things.
