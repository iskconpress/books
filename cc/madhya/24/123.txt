===== Purport =====

This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:26|(1.2.26)]]. Those who actually want the highest perfection worship Lord Viṣṇu in His different incarnations. Those who are attracted to the materialistic way of life and who are always agitated and full of anxiety worship demigods who appear fierce, demigods like goddess Kālī and Kāla-bhairava (Rudra). The devotees of Kṛṣṇa, however, do not envy the demigods or their worshipers but peacefully render devotional service to the incarnations of Nārāyaṇa instead.
