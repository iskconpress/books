The four Kumāras (Catuḥ-sana), Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the nine Yogendras were absorbed in Brahman realization, and how they became devotees is described herein. There are three kinds of impersonalists---the //mumukṣu// (those desiring liberation), the //jīvan-muktas// (those liberated in this life) and the //prāpta-svarūpas// (those merged in Brahman realization). All three types of //jñānīs// are called //mokṣākāṅkṣīs,// those desiring liberation. By associating with devotees, such people give up the //mumukṣu// principle and render devotional service. The real cause for this change is the association of devotees. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to attract all types of men, even those who desire things other than the Lord's devotional service. Through the association of devotees, they gradually begin to render devotional service.
