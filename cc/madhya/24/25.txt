===== Purport =====

In Sanskrit the verb "to do" has two forms, technically called //parasmaipada// and //ātmanepada.// When things are done for one's personal satisfaction, the form is called //ātmanepada.// In that case, the word "do" in English is //kurvante// in Sanskrit. When things are done for others, the verb form changes to //kurvanti.// Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu informed Sanātana Gosvāmī that in the //ātmārāma// verse the verb //kurvanti// means that things should be done only for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This is supported by the grammarian Pāṇini. The verb is formed as //ātmanepada// when the work is to be done for one's own benefit, and when it is done for others, it is called //parasmaipada.// Thus the verb is formed according to whether something is done for one's self-satisfaction or for another's satisfaction.
