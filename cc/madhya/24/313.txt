**"[Lord Śiva said,] 'I may know; Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, may know; and Vyāsadeva may know or may not know the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

===== Purport =====

Devotional service includes nine processes, beginning with hearing, chanting and remembering the activities of Lord Viṣṇu. Only one who has taken to devotional service can understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is the spotless //Purāṇa// for a transcendentalist (//paramahaṁsa//). So-called commentaries are useless for this purpose. According to the Vedic injunction: //yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.// All Vedic literatures maintain that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// has to be learned from the person //bhāgavata,// and to understand it one has to engage in pure devotional service. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// cannot be understood by so-called erudite scholars or grammarians. One who has developed pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness and has served the pure devotee, the spiritual master, can understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Others cannot.
