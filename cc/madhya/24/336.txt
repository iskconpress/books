===== Purport =====

The devotee should always be very careful not to commit the ten offenses when chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// If a devotee very strictly follows the methods of Deity worship, he will naturally and quickly become a pure Vaiṣṇava. A pure Vaiṣṇava has unflinching faith in the Lord, and he does not deviate at all. He is always engaged in perfect Deity worship.

One should also notice the specific offenses against Deity worship. These are mentioned in the //Skanda Purāṇa (Avantī-khaṇḍa),// spoken by Vyāsadeva himself. One should liquidate all kinds of offenses.

The //śālagrāma-śilā// should be worshiped with //tulasī// where a sufficient quantity of //tulasī// leaves are available. Worship of //śālagrāma-śilā// should be introduced in all ISKCON temples. //Śālagrāma-śilā// is the form of the Lord's mercy. To worship the Deity with the sixty-four items mentioned may be a difficult job, but the Lord has become so small that anyone in any temple can carefully handle Deity worship simply by performing the same activities with //śālagrāma-śilā.//

There are thirty-two offenses that should be avoided. (1) One should not enter the temple in a vehicle. Shoes and slippers should be removed before entering the temple.
