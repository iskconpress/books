===== Purport =====

As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:6:18|(5.6.18)]]: //muktiṁ dadāti karhicit.// Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī told Mahārāja Parīkṣit that Kṛṣṇa readily grants liberation but does not very readily grant perfection in devotional service. This means that Kṛṣṇa wants to see that a devotee is actually sincere and serious and that he does not have ulterior motives. If this is the case, devotional service can very easily be successful; otherwise it is very difficult to obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse appears in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.1.35).
