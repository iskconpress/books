Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that the original Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His expansions are also called the Personality of Godhead. However, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Speculative philosophers and mystic //yogīs// also meditate upon the form of Kṛṣṇa, but this form is not the form of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a Bhagavān is but a partial representation of the Lord's full potency. Nonetheless, He has to be understood to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To clarify this matter, one should simply understand that Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana, the friend of the cowherd boys and lover of the //gopīs,// is actually the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is attained by spontaneous love. Although His expansions are also called the Supreme Personality of Godhead, They are attained only by the execution of regulative devotional service.
