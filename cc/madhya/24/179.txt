This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:4:18|(2.4.18)]]. This verse was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī when Parīkṣit Mahārāja asked him for a description of the creation. While offering obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śukadeva Gosvāmī described the unlimited potencies of Lord Viṣṇu, who can purify the lowborn creatures mentioned herein.
