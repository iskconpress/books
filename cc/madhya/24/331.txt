The following injunction is given in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (1.194):

> tāntrikeṣu ca mantreṣu
> dīkṣāyāṁ yoṣitām api
> sādhvīnām adhikāro 'sti
> śūdrādīnāṁ ca sad-dhiyām

"//Śūdras// and women who are chaste and sincerely interested in understanding the Absolute Truth are qualified to be initiated with the //pāñcarātrika-mantras.//" his is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(Bg. 9.32)]]:

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatiṁ

"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth-women, //vaiśyas// [merchants], as well as //śūdras// [workers]---can approach the supreme destination."

If one actually wants to serve Kṛṣṇa, it doesn't matter whether one is a //śūdra, vaiśya,// or even a woman. If one is sincerely eager to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// or //dīkṣā-mantra,// he is qualified to be initiated according to the //pāñcarātrika// process. According to Vedic principles, only a //brāhmaṇa// who is fully engaged in his occupational duties can be initiated. //Śūdras// and women are not admitted to a //vaidika// initiation. Unless one is fit according to the estimation of the spiritual master, one cannot accept a //mantra// from the //pāñcarātrika-vidhi// or the //vaidika-vidhi.// When one is fit to accept the //mantra,// he is initiated by the //pāñcarātrika-vidhi// or the //vaidika-vidhi.// In any case, the result is the same.

Regarding //mantra-siddhi-ādi-śodhana,// the efficiency of the //mantra,// Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives sixteen divisions, which are confirmed in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (beginning with 1.204):

> siddha-sādhya-susiddhāri-
> kramāj jñeyo vicakṣaṇaiḥ

These are (1) //siddha,// (2) //sādhya,// (3) //susiddha// and (4) //ari.// These four principles can be divided further: (1) //siddha-siddha,// (2) //siddha-sādhya,// (3) //siddha-susiddha,// (4) //siddha-ari,// (5) //sādhya-siddha,// (6) //sādhya-sādhya,// (7) //sādhya-susiddha,// (8) //sādhya-ari,// (9) //susiddha-siddha,// (10) //susiddha-sādhya,// (11) //susiddha-susiddha,// (12) //susiddha-ari,// (13) //ari-siddha,// (14) //ari-sādhya,// (15) //ari-susiddha,// and (16) //ari-ari.//

Those who are initiated with the eighteen-alphabet //mantra// do not need to consider the above-mentioned sixteen divisions. As enjoined in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (1.215, 219, 220):

> na cātra śātravā doṣā
> narṇasvādi-vicāraṇā
> ṛkṣarāśi-vicāro vā
> na kartavyo manau priye
>
> nātra cintyo 'ri-śuddhyādir
>    nāri-mitrādi-lakṣaṇam
> siddha-sādhya-susiddhāri-
>    rūpā nātra vicāraṇā

There is //śodhana,// or purification of the //mantra,// but there is no such consideration for the Kṛṣṇa //mantra. Balitvāt kṛṣṇa-mantrāṇāṁ saṁskārāpekṣaṇaṁ na hi.// "The Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is so strong that there is no question of //śodhana.// (1.235)

As far as //dīkṣā// is concerned, one should consult //Madhya-līlā,// Chapter Fifteen (108). On the whole, when a person is initiated according to the //pāñcarātrika-vidhi,// he has already attained the position of a //brāhmaṇa.// This is enjoined in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (2.12):

> yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti
> kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ
> tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena
> dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām

"As bell metal can be turned into gold when treated with mercury, a disciple initiated by a bona fide //guru// immediately attains the position of a //brāhmaṇa."//

As far as the time of //dīkṣā// (initiation) is concerned, everything depends on the position of the //guru.// As soon as a bona fide //guru// is received by chance or by a program, one should immediately take the opportunity to receive initiation. In the book called //Tattva-sāgara,// it is stated:

> durlabhe sad-gurūṇāṁ ca
> sakṛt-saṅga upasthite
> tad-anujñā yadā labdhā
> sa dīkṣāvasaro mahān
>
> grāme vā yadi vāraṇye
> kṣetre vā divase niśi
> āgacchati gurur daivād
> yathā dīkṣā tad-ājñayā
>
> yadaivecchā tadā dīkṣā
> guror ājñānurūpataḥ
> na tīrthaṁ na vrataṁ hemo
> na snānaṁ na japa-kriyā
>
> dīkṣāyāḥ karaṇaṁ kintu
> svecchā-prāpte tu sad-gurau

"If, by chance, one gets a //sad-guru,// it doesn't matter whether one is in the temple or the forest. If the //sad-guru,// the bona fide spiritual master, agrees, one can be initiated immediately, without waiting for a suitable time or place."

In the early morning hours (known as //brāhma-muhūrta//) one should get up and immediately chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// or, at least, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa." In this way, one should remember Kṛṣṇa. Some //ślokas// or prayers should also be chanted. By chanting, one immediately becomes auspicious and transcendental to the infection of material qualities. Actually one has to chant and remember Lord Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours daily, or as much as possible.

> smartavyaḥ satataṁ viṣṇur
> vismartavyo na jātucit
> sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur
> etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ

"Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Lord Viṣṇu. He should always be remembered and never forgotten at any time. All the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the //śāstras// should be the servants of these two principles." This is a quotation from //padma Purāṇa// in the portion called //Bṛhat-sahasra-nāma-stotra. prātaḥ-kṛtya// means that one should evacuate regularly and then cleanse himself by taking a bath. One has to gargle (//ācamana//) and brush his teeth (//danta-dhāvana//). He should do this either with twigs or a toothbrush-whatever is available. This will purify the mouth. Then one should take his bath. Actually householders and //vānaprasthas// should bathe two times a day (//prātar-madhyāhnayoḥ snānaṁ vānaprastha-gṛhasthayoḥ//). A //sannyāsī// should bathe three times daily, and a //brahmacārī// may take only one bath a day. Whenever one is not able to bathe in water, he can bathe by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// One also has to perform his //sandhyādi-vandana---//that is, one has to chant his Gāyatrī //mantra// three times daily-morning, noon and evening.
