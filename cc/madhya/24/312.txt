===== Purport =====

The word //ātmā// refers to the living entity. From Lord Brahmā down to an insignificant ant, everyone is considered a living entity. Living entities are considered part of the Lord's marginal potency. All of them are //kṣetrajña,// knowers of the body. When they become //nirgrantha,// or free, saintly persons, they engage in Lord Kṛṣṇa's service. That is the sixty-first meaning of the verse.
