===== Purport =====

It is here mentioned that every living entity is //ātmārāma.// Temporarily covered by the influence of //māyā,// the living entity serves his senses, which are represented as //kāma-krodha-lobha-moha-mada-mātsarya.// In the material condition, all living entities are engaged in sense gratification, but when they associate with devotees who follow the regulative principles, they become purified and awakened to their original consciousness. They then attempt to satisfy the senses of Lord Kṛṣṇa and engage in His devotional service.
