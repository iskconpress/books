===== Purport =====

In Goloka Vṛndāvana the devotees have very intimate relationships with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotee engages in the Lord's service in great ecstatic love. Such love was exhibited personally by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His teachings to the people of the material world. The fruit of the devotional creeper is pure desire to serve and please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Kṛṣṇendriya-prīti-icchā dhare 'prema' nāma.// [[books:cc:adi:4:165|(Cc. Ādi 4.165)]] In the spiritual world one has no desire other than to please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conditioned soul within the material world can neither understand nor appreciate how the devotee in the material world can render confidential service to the Lord out of feelings of ecstatic love and always engage in pleasing the Supreme Lord's senses. Although seen within this material world, the pure devotee always engages in the confidential service of the Lord. An ordinary neophyte devotee cannot realize this; therefore it is said, //vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñāneha nā bujhaya.// The activities of a pure Vaiṣṇava cannot be understood even by a learned scholar in the material world.

Every living entity is wandering within this universe in different species and on different planetary systems according to his fruitive activities. Out of many millions of living entities, one may be fortunate enough to receive the seed of //bhakti-latā,// the creeper of devotional service. By the grace of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, one nourishes the //bhakti-latā// by regularly sprinkling it with the water of //śravaṇa-kīrtana,// hearing and chanting. In this way the seed of //bhakti-latā// sprouts and grows up and up through the whole universe until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and reaches the spiritual world. The //bhakti-latā// continues to grow until it reaches the topmost planetary system, Goloka Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa lives. There the creeper takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, and that is its final destination. At that time the creeper begins to grow the fruits of ecstatic love of God. It is the duty of the devotee who nourishes the creeper to be very careful. It is said that the watering of the creeper must continue: //ihāṅ mālī sece nitya śravaṇādi jala.// It is not that at a certain stage one can stop chanting and hearing and become a mature devotee. If one stops, one certainly falls down from devotional service. Although one may be very exalted in devotional service, he should not give up the watering process of //śravaṇa-kīrtana.// If one gives up that process, it is due to an offense. This is described in the following verse.
