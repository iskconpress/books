===== Purport =====

Sanātana Gosvāmī was the minister in charge of the government secretariat, and his assistants---the undersecretaries and clerks-all belonged to the //kāyastha// community. Formerly the //kāyasthas// belonged to the clerical and secretarial staff of the government, and later if one served in such a post, he was called a //kāyastha.// Eventually if a person could not identify himself as a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// he used to introduce himself as a //kāyastha// to get a wealthy and honorable position. In Bengal it is said that if one cannot give the identity of his caste, he calls himself a //kāyastha.// On the whole, the //kāyastha// community is a mixture of all castes, and it especially includes those engaged in clerical or secretarial work. Materially such people are always busy occupying responsible government posts.

When Sanātana Gosvāmī was relaxing and feeling inclined to retire from government service, many //kāyasthas// on his secretarial staff were very eager to occupy his post. In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that when Sanātana Gosvāmī was a government minister and the //kāyasthas// who assisted him saw that he was reluctant to continue, they became very expert in their duties. Sanātana Gosvāmī was a //brāhmaṇa// belonging to the Sārasvata //brāhmaṇa// community. It is said that when he resigned, an underworker named Purandara Khān, who was a //kāyastha,// occupied his post.
