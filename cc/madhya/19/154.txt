===== Purport =====

In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.37) it is said:

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord. He resides in His own realm, Goloka, with Rādhā, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic potency [//hlādinī//]. Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody extensions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with ever-blissful spiritual //rasa.//" n the spiritual world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has expanded Himself in His spiritual potency. He has His eternal form of bliss and knowledge (//sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha//). Everything in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet is a spiritual expansion of //sac-cid-ānanda.// Everyone there is of the same potency-//ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// The relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His servitor is //cinmaya-rasa.// Kṛṣṇa and His entourage and paraphernalia are of the same //cinmaya// potency. When the //cinmaya-rasa// potency goes through the material potency, it becomes all-pervading. Although the Supreme

Personality of Godhead exists on His own planet Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is present everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.// He is present within all universes, although they are innumerable. He is present within the atom. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati:// He is also present within the heart of all living entities. This is His all-pervasive potency.

Goloka Vṛndāvana is the highest planet in the spiritual world. In order to go to the spiritual world after penetrating the cover of the material universe, one must penetrate //brahma-loka,// the spiritual effulgence. Then one can come to the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. There are also other planets in the spiritual world called Vaikuṇṭha planets, and on these planets Lord Nārāyaṇa is worshiped with awe and veneration. On these planets the //śānta-rasa// is prevalent, and some of the devotees are also connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the //dāsya-rasa,// the mellow of servitorship. As far as the mellow of fraternity is concerned, the Vaikuṇṭha //rasa// is represented by //gaurava-sakhya,// friendship in awe and veneration. The other fraternity //rasa// is exhibited as //viśrambha// (friendship in equality), and this is found in the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet. Above that is service to the Lord in //vātsalya-rasa// (paternal love), and above all is the relationship with the Lord in the //mādhurya-rasa// (conjugal love). These five //rasas// are fully exhibited in the spiritual world in one's relationship with the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world the //bhakti-latā// creeper finds its resting place at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.
