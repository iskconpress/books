Sānta-bhakti-rasa is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (3.1.4, 5, 6)as follows:

> vakṣyamāṇair vibhāvādyaiḥ
> śamināṁ svādyatāṁ gataḥ
> sthāyī śānti-ratir dhīraiḥ
> śānta-bhakti-rasaḥ smṛtaḥ
>
> prāyaḥ svasukha-jātīyaṁ
> sukhaṁ syād atra yoginām
> kintv ātma-saukhyam aghanaṁ
> ghanaṁ tv īśam ayaṁ sukham
> tatrāpīśa-svarūpānubhavasyaivoru-hetutā
> dāsādi-van-mano-jñatva-līlāder na tathā matā

When //śānta-rati// (neutral attraction) is continuously existent and mixed with ecstatic emotion, and when the devotee relishes that neutral position, it is called //śānta-bhakti-rasa. Sānta-bhakti-rasa// devotees generally relish the impersonal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since their taste of transcendental bliss is incomplete, it is called //aghana,// or not concentrated. A comparison is made between ordinary milk and concentrated milk. When the same devotee goes beyond the impersonal and tastes the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,// the taste is called concentrated (//ghana//) transcendental bliss. Sometimes the devotees in the //śānta-rasa// relish transcendental bliss after meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this is not comparable to the transcendental bliss relished by the devotees situated in //dāsya-rasa,// the transcendental mellow in which one renders service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Dāsya-rasa, or //dāsya-bhakti-rasa,// is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (3.2.4,5) as follows:

> ātmocitair vibhāvādyaiḥ
> prītir āsvādanīyatām
> nītā cetasi bhaktānāṁ
> prīti-bhakti-raso mataḥ
>
> anugrāhyasya dāsatvāl
> lālyatvād apy ayaṁ dvidhā
> bhidyate sambhrama-prīto
> gaurava-prīta ity api

When according to the desires of the spirit soul the living entity develops love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this beginning of love is called //dāsya-bhakti-rasa. Dāsya-bhakti-rasa// is divided into two categories called //sambhrama-dāsya// and //gaurava-dāsya.// In the //sambhrama-dāsya,// the devotee renders respectful service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but in the more advanced //gaurava-dāsya,// his service takes the form of giving protection to the Lord.

Sakhya-bhakti-rasa is described as follows in //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (3.3.1):

> sthāyibhāvo vibhāvādyaiḥ
> sakhyam ātmocitair iha
> nītaś citte satāṁ puṣṭiṁ
> rasaḥ preyānudīryate

> eṣa vatsala-nāmātra

> madhurākhyo bhaved bhaktir
> aso 'sau madhurā ratiḥ

"If in accordance with one's own natural development in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one's attraction leans toward conjugal love within the heart, that is called attachment in conjugal love, or //madhura-rasa."//

Similarly, //hāsya, adbhuta, vīra, karuṇa, raudra, bhaya// and //bībhatsa---//the seven indirect mellows-are explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// The //hāsya-bhakti-rasa,// laughing devotion, is explained as follows (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 4.1.6):

> vakṣyamāṇair vibhāvādyaiḥ
> puṣṭiṁ hāsa-ratir gatā

> saivotsāha-ratiḥ sthāyī
> vibhāvādyair nijocitaḥ
> ānīyamānā svādyatvaṁ
> vīra-bhakti-raso bhavet
> yuddha-dāna-dayā-dharmaiś
> caturdhā-vīra ucyate

> bhavec choka-ratir bhakti-
> raso hi karuṇābhidhaḥ

> bībhatsākhya itīryate

"When one's attachment for Kṛṣṇa develops in an abominable way, and the devotee enjoys it, that is called //bībhatsa-bhakti-rasa."//

In conclusion, when a pure devotee is situated in any of the five principal mellows (//śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya// and //madhura),// and the mellow is mixed with the seven indirect //bhakti-rasas (hāsya, adbhuta, vīra, karuṇa, raudra, bhayānaka// and //bībhatsa),// the indirect mellows become prominent.
