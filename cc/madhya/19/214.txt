===== Purport =====

In this position, one is freed from all material enjoyment. When one is not agitated or disturbed, he can immediately realize his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. A //śānta-rasa// devotee is therefore always fixed in realization. This instruction was given by the Lord Himself to Uddhava. The beginning of pure devotional service is called //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya.// When one is situated on the platform of neutrality, he is freed from the material platform and fully situated in spiritual life. The word //dama// used in verse 213 means //indriya-saṁyama-//curbing one's senses. The word //dama// can also mean curbing one's enemies. A king has to take steps to curb the criminal activities of his citizens. Great //rājarṣis,// devotee kings, used to control undesirable elements in their states, and this also may be called //dama.// However, //dama// here refers to the conditioned soul who must control his senses. Real //dama// means controlling the undesirable activities of the senses.
