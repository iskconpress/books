In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said that due to their poor fund of knowledge, the //jñānīs// are not actually liberated. They simply think that they are liberated. The perfection of knowledge culminates when one comes to the platform of knowing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.// The Absolute Truth (//satya-vastu//) is described as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Knowledge of impersonal Brahman and the Supersoul is imperfect until one comes to the platform of knowing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore clearly said in this verse: //koṭi-mukta-madhye 'durlabha' eka kṛṣṇa-bhakta.// Those who search after the knowledge of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramātmā are certainly accepted as liberated, but due to their imperfect knowledge they are described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as //vimukta-māninaḥ.// Since their knowledge is imperfect, their conception of liberation is imperfect. Perfect knowledge is possible when one knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is supported in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]]:

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ

> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati

"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries."

Research is going on for the //karmīs, jñānīs// and //yogīs,// but until the search is complete, no one can attain peace. Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati:// one can actually attain peace when he knows Kṛṣṇa. This is described in the next verse.
