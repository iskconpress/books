Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following commentary on the words //bhāgavata vicāra.// As confirmed in the //Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// (1.1.4,5), there are two kinds of educational systems:

> dve vidye veditavya iti, ha sma yad brahma-vido vadanti-parā caivāparā ca. tatrāparā ṛg-vedo yajur-vedaḥ sāma-vedo 'tharva-vedaḥ śikṣā kalpo vyākaraṇaṁ niruktaṁ chando jyotiṣam iti. atha parā yayā tad-akṣaram adhigamyate.

"There are two kinds of educational systems. One deals with transcendental knowledge [//parā vidyā//] and the other with material knowledge [//aparā vidyā//]. All the //Vedas-Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, Atharva Veda// and their corollaries known as //śikṣā, kalpa, vyākaraṇa, nirukta, chanda// and //jyotiṣa-//belong to the inferior system of material knowledge [//aparā vidyā//]. By //parā vidyā,// one can understand the //akṣara,// Brahman or the Absolute Truth." As far as Vedic literature is concerned, //Vedānta-sūtra// is accepted as the //parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is an explanation of that //parā vidyā.// Those who aspire for liberation (//mukti// or //mokṣa//) and introduce themselves as //vaidāntika// are also equal to those groups aspiring to improve religion (//dharma//), economic development (//artha//) and sense gratification (//kāma//). //Dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa// are called //catur-varga.// They are all within the system of inferior material knowledge. Any literature giving information about the spiritual world, spiritual life, spiritual identity and the spirit soul is called //parā vidyā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// does not have anything to do with the materialistic way of life; it gives transcendental information to educate people in the superior system of //parā vidyā.// Sanātana Gosvāmī was engaged in discussing the //bhāgavata-vidyā,// which means he discussed transcendental superior knowledge. Those who are //karmīs, jñānīs// or //yogīs// are not actually fit to discuss //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Only Vaiṣṇavas or pure devotees are fit to discuss that literature. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// itself (12.13.18):

> śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ purāṇam amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyaṁ
> yasmin pāramahaṁsyam ekam amalaṁ jñānaṁ paraṁ gīyate
> yatra jñāna-virāga-bhakti-sahitaṁ naiṣkarmyam āviṣkṛtaṁ
> tac chṛṇvan supaṭhan vicāraṇa-paro bhaktyā vimucyen naraḥ

Although //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is counted among the //Purāṇas,// it is called the spotless //Purāṇa.// Because it does not discuss anything material, it is liked by transcendental Vaiṣṇava devotees. The subject matter found in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is meant for //paramahaṁsas.// As it is said: //paramo-nirmatsarāṇām. A paramahaṁsa// is one who does not live in the material world and who does not envy others. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// devotional service is discussed to arouse the living entity to the transcendental position of //jñāna// (knowledge) and //vairāgya// (renunciation). As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:12|(1.2.12)]]:

> tac chraddadhānāḥ munayo
> jñāna-vairāgya-yuktayā
> paśyanty ātmani cātmānaṁ
> bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā

"That Absolute Truth is realized by the seriously inquisitive student or sage who is well equipped with knowledge and who has become detached by rendering devotional service and hearing the //Vedānta-śruti."//

This is not sentiment. Knowledge and renunciation can be obtained through devotional service (//bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā//), that is, by arousing one's dormant devotional consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When Kṛṣṇa consciousness is aroused, it relieves one from fruitive activity, activity for economic improvement and material enjoyment. This relief is technically called //naiṣkarma,// and when one is relieved, he is no longer interested in working hard for sense gratification. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is Śrīla Vyāsadeva's last mature contribution, and one should read and hear it in an assembly of realized souls while engaging in devotional service. At such a time one can be liberated from all material bondage. This was the course taken by Sanātana Gosvāmī, who retired from government service to study //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// with learned scholars.
