===== Purport =====

This verse is from the //Dāmodarāṣṭaka// in the //Padma Purāṇa.// Attachment for Kṛṣṇa in //śānta-rasa,// rendering service to the Lord in //dāsya-rasa,// rendering relaxed service in fraternity, and serving in parental love with feelings of maintenance all combine on the platform of conjugal love when the devotee wants to serve the Lord by offering Him his personal body. Thus the qualities of the other //rasas// combine to form the nectar of conjugal love. On this platform, all the different feelings of a devotee are amalgamated.
