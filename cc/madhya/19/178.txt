===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (3.2.84) //sneha// (affection) is described as follows:

> sāndraś citta-dravaṁ kurvan
> premā 'sneha' itīryate
> kṣaṇikasyāpi neha syād
> visleṣasya sahiṣṇutā

"That aspect of //prema// in which the melting of the heart for the lover is concentrated is called //sneha,// or affection. The symptom of such affection is that the lover cannot for a moment remain without the association of the beloved." A description of //māna// can be found in //Madhya-līlā// (Chapter Two, verse 66). Similarly, a description of //praṇaya// is also there. As far as //rāga// is concerned, //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (3.2.87) says:

> snehaḥ sa rāgo yena syāt
> sukhaṁ duḥkham api sphuṭam
> tat-sambandha-lave 'py atra
> prītiḥ prāṇa-vyayair api

"That stage at which affection for the beloved converts unhappiness into happiness is called //rāga,// or attachment. When one has such attachment for Kṛṣṇa, he can give up his own life to satisfy his beloved Kṛṣṇa." //Anurāga, bhāva// and //mahābhāva// are described in the Sixth Chapter of //Madhya-līlā,// verse 13. The purport to that verse explains //adhirūḍha-mahābhāva.//
