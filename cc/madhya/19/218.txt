===== Translation =====

**"It is the nature of śānta-rasa that not even the smallest intimacy exists. Rather, knowledge of impersonal Brahman and localized Paramātmā is prominent.**

===== Purport =====

Because of an impersonal impression of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee in the //śānta-rasa// relationship worships the impersonal Brahman or localized aspect of the Absolute Truth (Paramātmā). He does not develop a personal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
