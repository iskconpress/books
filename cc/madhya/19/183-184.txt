===== Translation =====

**"According to the devotee, attachment falls within the five categories of śānta-rati, dāsya-rati, sakhya-rati, vātsalya-rati and madhura-rati. These five categories arise from the devotees' different attachments to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The transcendental mellows derived from devotional service are also of five varieties.**

===== Purport =====

//Śānta-rati// is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (2.5.16, 17, 18) as follows:

> mānase nirvikalpatvaṁ
> śama ity abhidhīyate

"When one is completely free from all doubts and material attachments, he attains the neutral position called //śānta."//

> vihāya viṣayonmukhyaṁ
> nijānanda-sthitir yataḥ
> ātmanaḥ kathyate so 'tra
> svabhāvaḥ śama ity asau
>
> prāyaḥ śama-pradhāñanāṁ
> mamatā-gandha-varjitā
> paramātmatayā kṛṣṇe
> jātā śānta-ratir matā

The //śānta-rati// realization of Kṛṣṇa is in the neutral stage between the conception of impersonalism and personalism. This means that one is not very strongly attached to the personal feature of the Lord. An appreciation of the greatness of the Lord is called //śānta-rati.// This is attachment not to the personal feature but to the impersonal feature. Generally, one in this stage is attached to the Paramātmā feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā

"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." [[books:bg:18:61|(Bg. 18.61)]]

On the strength of this statement from //Bhagavad-gītā,// we can understand that in the //śānta-rasa,// a devotee sees the Lord's representation everywhere. //Dāsya-rati// is explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (2.5.27) thus:

> svasmād bhavanti ye nyūnās
> te 'nugrāhyā harer matāḥ
> ārādhyatvātmikā teṣāṁ
> ratiḥ prītir itīritā
> tatrāsaktikṛd anyatra
> prīti-saṁhāriṇī hy asau

When the Supreme Lord in His localized aspect is appreciated and a great devotee understands his subordinate position, not only does he surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but, due to his subordinate position, he wishes to render some service and thus become favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee in the //śānta-rati// is not very much willing to render service to the Lord, but a devotee in the //dāsya-rati// voluntarily wants to render service. Due to this attitude, the devotee in the //dāsya-rati// realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead more fully than a devotee in the //śānta-rati.// He considers the Lord to be a worshipable object, and this means that his attachment for the Lord increases. On the //dāsya-rati// platform a devotee is attached to rendering service to the Lord, and he is detached from material activities. The //śānta-rati// is neither material nor spiritual, but the //dāsya-rati// is actually on the spiritual platform. There is no attachment for material things on the spiritual platform. A devotee in //dāsya-rati// has no attachment for anything but Kṛṣṇa's service.

Sakhya-rati is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (2.5.30) as follows:

> ye syus tulyā mukundasya
> te sakhāyaḥ satāṁ matāḥ
> sāmyād viśrambha-rūpaiṣāṁ
> ratiḥ sakhyam ihocyate

According to the opinion of advanced devotees and learned scholars, a devotee in //sakhya-rati// feels equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a relationship in friendship. Due to having a friendly relationship with the Lord, not only is one free from material attachment, but one believes in equal dealings with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called //sakhya-rati.// The //sakhya-rati// devotee is so advanced that he treats the Lord on an equal level and even exchanges joking words. Although one is never equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the //sakhya-rati// devotee feels equal to the Lord, and he does not feel guilty because of this. Actually it is offensive to consider oneself equal to the Lord. The Māyāvādīs consider themselves equal to the Lord, but such feelings entail bereavement because they are material. The //sakhya-rati,// however, is a feeling experienced in the mind by a pure devotee, and he is eternally related with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in that feeling.

Vātsalya-rati is described as follows in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (2.5.33):

> guravo ye harer asya
> te pūjyā iti viśrutāḥ
> anugrahamayī teṣāṁ
> ratir vātsalyam ucyate
> idaṁ lālana-bhavyāśīś
> cibuka-sparśanādi-kṛt

When a living entity is situated on the platform of //vātsalya-rati,// he thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His childhood feature. In this feature, the Lord has to be protected by the devotee, and at this time the devotee takes the position of being worshiped by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The feelings of paternal love are called //vātsalya-rati.// When the devotee is situated on this platform, he wants to maintain the Lord like a son, and he desires all good fortune for the Lord. He offers blessings to the Lord by touching His feet and head.

Madhura-rati, or attachment in conjugal love, is described as follows:

> mitho harer mṛgākṣyāś ca
> sambhogasyādi-kāraṇam
> madhurāpara-paryāyā
> priyatākhyoditā ratiḥ
> asyāṁ kaṭākṣa-bhrūkṣepa-
> priya-vāṇī-smitādayaḥ

The conjugal relationship is experienced between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the young damsels of Vrajabhūmi, and due to their conjugal love they continuously exist in eight kinds of remembrances called //madhura-rati.// This intimate relationship brought about by conjugal love produces movements of the eyebrows, glancing, sweet words and exchanges of joking words.
