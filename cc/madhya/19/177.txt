//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.2.2) gives the following information about //sādhana-bhakti://

> kṛti-sādhyā bhavet sādhya-
> bhāvā sā sādhanābhidhā
> nitya-siddhasya bhāvasya
> prākaṭyaṁ hṛdi sādhyatā

The process of devotional service-beginning with chanting and hearing-is called //sādhana-bhakti.// This includes the regulative principles that are intended to awaken one to devotional service. Devotional service is always dormant in everyone's heart, and by the offenseless chanting of the holy names of the Lord, one's original dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened. This awakening to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the beginning of //sādhana-bhakti.// This can be divided into many different parts, including faith, association with devotees, initiation by the spiritual master, engagement in devotional service under the instructions of a spiritual master, steadiness in devotional service and the awakening of a taste for devotional service. In this way, one can become attached to Kṛṣṇa and His service, and when this attachment is intensified, it results in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa. The word //rati// is explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.3.41) as follows:

> vyaktaṁ masṛṇatevāntar-
> lakṣyate rati-lakṣaṇam
> mumukṣu-prabhṛtīnāṁ ced
> bhaved eṣā ratir na hi

"When a tenderness of the heart is manifest, there is //rati,// or attachment. Those who are interested in being liberated from material bondage must manifest this tenderness called //rati.//" his attachment is not like material attachment. When one is liberated from material contamination, the awakening of attachment for Kṛṣṇa's service is called //rati.// In the material world there is attachment for material enjoyment, but this is not //rati.// Transcendental //rati// can be awakened only on the spiritual platform. Ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa (//prema//) is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.41) as follows:

> samyaṅ masṛṇita-svānto
> mamatvātiśayāṅkitaḥ
> bhāvaḥ sa eva sāndrātmā
> budhaiḥ premā nigadyate

"When the heart is completely softened and devoid of all material desires and when one's emotional feelings become very strong, one becomes very much attached to Kṛṣṇa. Such purified emotion is known as pure love."
