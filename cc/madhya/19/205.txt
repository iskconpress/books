===== Purport =====

This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.9.14) is in reference to Lord Kṛṣṇa's exhibiting Himself like an ordinary child before mother Yaśodā. He was playing like a naughty boy stealing butter and breaking butter pots. Mother Yaśodā became disturbed and wanted to bind the Lord to a mortar used for pounding spices. In other words, she considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead an ordinary child.
