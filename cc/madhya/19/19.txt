Although Nawab Hussain Shah was a //mleccha-yavana,// he was nonetheless the governor of the country, and the learned scholars and Sanātana Gosvāmī offered him all the respect due a king or a governor. When a person occupies an exalted executive post, one should consider that he has acquired the grace of the Lord. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said:

> yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
> śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
> tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
> mama tejo 'ṁśa-saṁbhavam

"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor." [[books:bg:10:41|(Bg. 10.41)]]

Whenever we see something exalted, we must consider it part of the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A powerful man (//vibhūtimat sattvam//) is one who has obtained the grace of the Lord or has derived some power from Him. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:10|(Bg. 7.10)]] Kṛṣṇa says, //tejas tejasvinām aham:// "I am the power of the powerful." The learned //brāhmaṇa// scholars showed respect to Nawab Hussain Shah because he represented a fraction of Kṛṣṇa's power.
