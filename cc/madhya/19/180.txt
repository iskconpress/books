Attachment for Kṛṣṇa never wanes; it increases more and more as one attains different stages. All the stages together are called //sthāyibhāva,// or continuous existence. The nine forms of devotional service are //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam.// When continuous love of Godhead is mixed with the processes of devotional service, it is called //vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika// and //vyabhicārī.// The devotee thus enjoys a variety of transcendental bliss. In his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that //anubhāva// can be divided into thirteen categories: (1) dancing, (2) rolling on the ground, (3) singing, (4) yelling, (5) jumping, (6) making loud noises, (7) yawning, (8) heavy breathing, (9) not caring for public opinion, (10) discharging saliva, (11) roaring laughter, (12) unsteadiness and (13) hiccupping. These are the symptoms of //anubhāva.// Thus the transcendental mellows are experienced in different stages. Similarly, there are many other forms of expression that have been analytically studied by the Gosvāmīs. In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Rūpa Gosvāmī gives each and every symptom a particular name.
