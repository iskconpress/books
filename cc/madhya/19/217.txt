**"These two qualities of the śānta stage spread through the lives of all devotees. They are like the quality of sound in the sky. Sound vibration is found in all material elements.**

===== Purport =====

The qualities of //śānta-rasa// are present in all kinds of devotees, whether they are in the //dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa// or //madhura-rasa.// The example of sound is given herein. Sound not only exists in the sky, or ether, but it is also present in air, fire, water and earth. This is a scientific explanation of devotional service. just as sound is present in all material elements, //śānta-rasa// is present in all devotees, whether they are on the platform of //dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa// or //madhura-rasa.//
