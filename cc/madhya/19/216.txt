===== Purport =====

This verse is quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:6:17:28|(6.17.28)]]. Elevation to the heavenly planets, liberation from material bondage, and condemnation to hell are all equal to the devotee. The devotee's only desire is to be attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and to engage in His transcendental loving service.
