Lord Kṛṣṇa has many forms, as stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33): //advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Raghupati Upādhyāya which form was the best of Lord Kṛṣṇa's millions of forms, and he immediately replied that the supreme form was the Śyāmasundara form. In that form, Kṛṣṇa stands curved in three places and holds His flute. The Śyāmasundara form is also described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.38):

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Śyāmasundara situated within the heart of the devotee."

Those who are filled with ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa always see the form of Śyāmasundara within their hearts. Raghupati Upādhyāya confirms that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many incarnations-Nārāyaṇa, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and others---but Kṛṣṇa is distinguished as the supermost. According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// "Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead." Kṛṣṇa means Śyāmasundara, who plays His flute in Vṛndāvana. Of all forms, this form is the best of all. Kṛṣṇa lives sometimes in Mathurā and sometimes in Dvārakā, but Mathurā is considered the better place. This is also confirmed by Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Upadeśāmṛta// (9): //vaikuṇṭhāj janito varā madhu-purī.// "Madhu-purī, or Mathurā, is far superior to the Vaikuṇṭhalokas in the spiritual world."
