This verse, quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.31.16), describes how the //gopīs// exposed themselves for Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment in the dead of night. The //gopīs// approached Kṛṣṇa to enjoy themselves with Him in the //rāsa// dance. Kṛṣṇa knew this very well, but He was superficially trying to avoid them. He is therefore addressed by the //gopīs// as //kitava,// a great cheater, because He first attracted them to come dance with Him, and yet when they actually came, neglecting the orders of their friends and relatives, He tried to avoid them by giving them good instructions. These cunning instructions were too much for the //gopīs// to tolerate; they therefore had a right to address Kṛṣṇa as //kitava,// a great cheater. They were all young girls, and they had come to Him to be enjoyed. How could He avoid them? The //gopīs// therefore expressed great disappointment in this verse. They came voluntarily, but Kṛṣṇa was so cunning that He wanted to avoid their company. The //gopīs'// lamentation was certainly very appropriate, and in this way Kṛṣṇa tested their sincerity.
