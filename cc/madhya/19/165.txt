**"As long as there is not the slightest fragrance of pure love of Kṛṣṇa, which is the perfected medicinal herb for controlling Lord Kṛṣṇa within the heart, the opulences of material perfection-known as the siddhis, the brahminical perfections [satya, śama, titikṣā and so on], the trance of the yogīs and the monistic bliss of Brahman-all seem wonderful for men.**

There are different types of material perfection known as //siddhi-vraja,// brahminical qualifications, yogic trance and merging into the Supreme. All these are certainly very attractive for a mundane person, but their brilliance exists only as long as one does not take to devotional service. Devotional service can control the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme controller of all universal affairs. The five //rasas// (mellows) in the transcendental world are practiced by the inhabitants of Goloka Vṛndāvana in neutrality, servitorship, friendship, paternal affection and conjugal love. All these please the Lord so much that He is controlled by the devotees. For instance, mother Yaśodā was so advanced in devotional service that Kṛṣṇa agreed to be controlled by her stick. In other words, the five principal mellows are so great and glorious that they are able to control the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the material world, however, the so-called //siddhis,// or perfections, manifest their brightness only as long as one is not interested in devotional service. In other words, the perfection of the //karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs// and others remains attractive only as long as one does not come to the point of devotional service, which is so great and significant that it can control the supreme controller, Kṛṣṇa.
