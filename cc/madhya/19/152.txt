To live with devotees or to live in a temple means to associate with the //śravaṇa-kīrtana// process. Sometimes neophyte devotees think that they can continue the //śravaṇa-kīrtana// process without worshiping the Deity, but the execution of //śravaṇa-kīrtana// is meant for highly developed devotees like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who engaged in the //śravaṇa-kīrtana// process without worshiping the Deity. However, one should not falsely imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura and abandon Deity worship just to try to engage in //śravaṇa-kīrtana.// This is not possible for neophyte devotees.

The word //guru-prasāda// indicates that the spiritual master is very merciful in bestowing the boon of devotional service upon the disciple. That is the best possible gift the spiritual master has to offer. Those with a background of pious life are eligible to receive life's supreme benefit, and to bestow this benefit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends His representative to impart His mercy. Endowed with the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master distributes the mercy to those who are elevated and pious. Thus the spiritual master trains his disciples to render devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called //guru-kṛpā.// It is //kṛṣṇa-prasāda,// Kṛṣṇa's mercy, that He sends a bona fide spiritual master to the deserving disciple. By the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, one meets the bona fide spiritual master, and by the mercy of the spiritual master, the disciple is fully trained in the devotional service of the Lord.

Bhakti-latā-bīja means "the seed of devotional service." Everything has an original cause, or seed. For any idea, program, plan or device, there is first of all the contemplation of the plan, and that is called //bīja,// or the seed. The methods, rules and regulations by which one is perfectly trained in devotional service constitute the //bhakti-latā-bīja,// or seed of devotional service. This //bhakti-latā-bīja// is received from the spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. Other seeds are called //anyābhilāṣa-bīja, karma-bīja// and //jñāna-bīja.// If one is not fortunate enough to receive the //bhakti-latā-bīja// from the spiritual master, he instead cultivates the seeds of //karma-bīja, jñāna-bīja,// or political and social or philanthropic //bīja.// However, //bhakti-latā-bīja// is different from these other //bījas. Bhakti-latā-bīja// can be received only through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore one has to satisfy the spiritual master to get //bhakti-latā-bīja (yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ). Bhakti-latā-bīja// is the origin of devotional service. Unless one satisfies the spiritual master, he gets the //bīja,// or root cause, of //karma, jñāna// and //yoga// without the benefit of devotional service. However, one who is faithful to his spiritual master gets the //bhakti-latā-bīja.// This //bhakti-latā-bīja// is received when one is initiated by the bona fide spiritual master. After receiving the spiritual master's mercy, one must repeat his instructions, and this is called //śravaṇa-kīrtana-//hearing and chanting. One who has not properly heard from the spiritual master or who does not follow the regulative principles is not fit for chanting (//kīrtana).// This is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:41|(Bg. 2.41)]]: //vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana.// One who has not listened carefully to the instructions of the spiritual master is unfit to chant or preach the cult of devotional service. One has to water the //bhakti-latā-bīja// after receiving instructions from the spiritual master.
