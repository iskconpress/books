Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya's admission of the brothers' exalted position should serve as a lesson to one who is falsely proud of his position as a //brāhmaṇa.// Sometimes so-called //brāhmaṇas// do not recognize our European and American disciples as devotees or //brāhmaṇas,// and some //brāhmaṇas// are so proud that they do not allow them to enter temples. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu herein gives a great lesson. Although Vallabha Bhaṭṭācārya was a great authority on brahmanism and a learned scholar, he admitted that those who chant the Lord's holy name are bona fide //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas and are therefore exalted.
