===== Purport =====

If one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// while committing offenses, these unwanted creepers will grow. One should not take advantage of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// for some material profit. As mentioned in verse 159:

> 'niṣiddhācāra', 'kuṭīnāṭī', jīva-hiṁsana'
> 'lābha', 'pūjā', 'pratiṣṭhādi' yata upaśākhā-gaṇa

The unwanted creepers have been described by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. He states that if one hears and chants without trying to give up offenses, one becomes materially attached to sense gratification. One may also desire freedom from material bondage like the Māyāvādīs, or one may become attached to the //yoga-siddhis// and desire wonderful yogic powers. If one is attached to wonderful material activities, one is called //siddhi-lobhī,// greedy for material perfection. One may also be victimized by diplomatic or crooked behavior, or one may associate with women for illicit sex. Others may make a show of devotional service like the //prākṛta-sahajiyās,// or one may try to support his philosophy by joining some caste or identifying himself with a certain dynasty, claiming a monopoly on spiritual advancement. Thus with the support of family tradition, one may become a pseudo //guru// or so-called spiritual master. One may become attached to the four sinful activities-illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat eating, or one may consider a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a mundane caste or creed. One may think, "This is a Hindu Vaiṣṇava, and this is a European Vaiṣṇava. A European Vaiṣṇava is not allowed to enter the temples." In other words, one may consider Vaiṣṇavas in terms of birth, thinking one a //brāhmaṇa// Vaiṣṇava, a //śūdra// Vaiṣṇava, a //mleccha// Vaiṣṇava and so on. One may also try to carry out a professional business while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// or reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// or one may try to increase his monetary strength by illegal means. One may also try to be a cheap Vaiṣṇava by chanting in a secluded place for material adoration, or one may desire mundane reputation by making compromises with nondevotees, compromising one's philosophy or spiritual life, or one may become a supporter of a hereditary caste system. All these are pitfalls of personal sense gratification. Just to cheat some innocent people, one makes a show of advanced spiritual life and becomes known as a //sādhu, mahātmā// or religious person. All this means that the so-called devotee has become victimized by all these unwanted creepers and that the real creeper of //bhakti-latā-bīja// has been stunted.
