Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that the word //karma-niṣṭha// refers to one who aspires to enjoy the results of his good work and pious activity. Some followers of Vedic principles offer everything to the Absolute Truth and do not aspire to enjoy the results of their pious actions. These are also considered among the //karma-niṣṭhas.// Sometimes we see pious men earn money with great hardship and then spend the money for some pious cause by opening public charities, schools and hospitals. Whether one earns money for himself or for the public benefit, he is called a //karma-niṣṭha.// Out of millions of //karma-niṣṭhas// there may be one who is wise. Those who try to avoid fruitive activity and who become silent in order to merge into the spiritual existence of the Absolute Truth are generally known as //jñānīs,// wise men. They are not interested in fruitive activity but in merging into the Supreme. In either case, both are interested in personal benefit. The //karmīs// are directly interested in personal benefit within the material world, and the //jñānīs// are interested in merging into the existence of the Supreme. The //jñānīs// maintain that fruitive activity is imperfect. For them, perfection is the cessation of work and the merging into the supreme existence. That is their goal in life. The //jñānī// wants to extinguish the distinction between knowledge, the knower and the aim of knowledge. This philosophy is called monism, or oneness, and is characterized by spiritual silence.
