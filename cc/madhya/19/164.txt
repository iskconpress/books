===== Purport =====

The highest achievement attained by the //jñānīs// or impersonalists is becoming one with the Supreme, generally known as //mokṣa,// liberation. The highest achievements of the //yogīs// are the eight material perfections such as //aṇimā, laghimā// and //prāpti.// Yet these are nothing compared to the eternal bliss of the devotee who returns back to Godhead and tastes the fruit of devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The material perfections up to the point of liberation are very insignificant in comparison; therefore the pure devotee is never interested in such things. His only interest is in perfecting his devotional service to the Lord. The pleasure of the impersonalist monist philosophers is condemned in the following verse, which is also found in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī's //Lalita-mādhava.//
