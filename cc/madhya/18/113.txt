Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// consider themselves Brahman, and they superficially speak of themselves as Nārāyaṇa. The monistic disciples of the Māyāvāda school (known as //smārta-brāhmaṇas//) are generally householder //brāhmaṇas// who accept the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// as Nārāyaṇa incarnate; therefore they offer their obeisances to them. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately protested this unauthorized system, specifically mentioning that a //sannyāsī// (//cit-kaṇa jīva//) is nothing but a fragmental portion of the Supreme. In other words, he is nothing more than an ordinary living being. He is never Nārāyaṇa, just as a molecular portion of sunshine is never the sun itself. The living entity is nothing but a fragmental part of the Absolute Truth; therefore at no stage of perfection can a living entity become the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Māyāvāda viewpoint is always condemned by the Vaiṣṇava school. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself protested this philosophy. When the Māyāvādīs accept //sannyāsa// and consider themselves Nārāyaṇa, they become so puffed up that they do not even enter the temple of Nārāyaṇa to offer respects, for they falsely think themselves Nārāyaṇa Himself. Although Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// may offer respects to other //sannyāsīs// and address them as Nārāyaṇa, they do not go to a Nārāyaṇa temple and offer respects. These Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// are always condemned and are described as demons. The //Vedas// clearly state that living entities are subordinate parts and parcels of the supreme. //Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān:// the Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa, maintains all living entities.
