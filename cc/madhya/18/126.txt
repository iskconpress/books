**"These glories of Yours are only marginal. Originally You are the son of Mahārāja Nanda."**

===== Purport =====

The original characteristics of a substance are called //svarūpa,// and the subsequent corollaries are called //taṭastha-lakṣaṇa,// or marginal characteristics. The glories of the Lord's marginal characteristics prove Him to be the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Mahārāja Nanda. As soon as one understands this, one accepts Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
