===== Purport =====

The revealed scripture of the Mohammedans is the Koran. There is one Mohammedan //sampradāya// known as the Sufis. The Sufis accept impersonalism, believing in the oneness of the living entity with the Absolute Truth. Their supreme slogan is //"analahak.//" he Sufi //sampradāya// was certainly derived from Śaṅkarācārya's impersonalists.
