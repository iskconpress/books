The word //yavana// means "meat-eater." Anyone from a meat-eating community is called a //yavana.// One who does not strictly observe the Vedic regulative principles is called a //mleccha.// These words do not refer to any particular man. Even if a person is born in a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra// family, he is a //mleccha// or //yavana// if he does not strictly follow the regulative principles or if he eats meat.
