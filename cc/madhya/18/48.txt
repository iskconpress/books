Śrī Vallabha Bhaṭṭa had two sons. The elder, Gopīnātha, was born in 1432 Śakābda Era, and the younger, Viṭhṭhalanātha, was born in 1437 and died in 1507. Viṭhṭhala had seven sons: Giridhara, Govinda, Bālakṛṣṇa, Gokuleśa, Raghunātha, Yadunātha and Ghanaśyāma. Viṭhṭhala completed many of his father's unfinished books, including his commentary on //Vedānta-sūtra,// the //Subodhinī// commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Vidvan-maṇḍana, Śṛṅgāra-rasa-maṇḍana// and //Nyāsādeśa-vivaraṇa.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Vṛndāvana before the birth of Viṭhṭhala. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was very old at the time Gopāla stayed at the house of Viṭhṭhalanātha.
