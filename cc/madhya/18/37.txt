Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura gives the following information about Govinda-kuṇḍa. There is a village named Āniyora on Govardhana Hill, a little distance from the village of Paiṭhā. Govinda-kuṇḍa is situated near here, and there are two temples to Govinda and Baladeva there. According to some, Queen Padmāvatī excavated this lake. In the //Bhakti-ratnākara// (Fifth Wave), the following statement is found:

> ei śrī-govinda-kuṇḍa-mahimā aneka
> ethā indra kaila govindera abhiṣeka

"Govinda-kuṇḍa is exalted for its many spiritual activities. It was here that Indra was defeated by Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Indra offered his prayers and bathed Lord Govinda." In the book //Stavāvalī// (//Vraja-vilāsa-stava// 74) the following verse is found:

> nīcaiḥ prauḍha-bhayāt svayaṁ surapatiḥ pādau vidhṛtyeha yaiḥ
> svar-gaṅgā-salilaiś cakāra surabhi-dvārābhiṣekotsavam
> govindasya navaṁ gavām adhipatā rājye sphuṭaṁ kautukāt
> tair yat prādurabhūt sadā sphuratu tad govinda-kuṇḍaṁ dṛśoḥ

In the //Mathurā-khaṇḍa// it is also stated:

> yatrābhiṣikto bhagavān
> maghonā yadu-vairiṇā
> govinda-kuṇḍaṁ taj-jātaṁ
> snāna-mātreṇa mokṣadam

"Simply by bathing in Govinda-kuṇḍa, one is awarded liberation. This lake was produced when Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa was bathed by Lord Indra."

Gāṅṭhuli-grāma is situated near the two villages Bilachu and Gopāla-pura. According to hearsay, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa first met here. In the //Bhakti-ratnākara// (Fifth Wave), it is stated: //sakhī duṅha vastre gāṅṭhi dila saṅgopane.// It is also stated: //phāguyā laiyā keha gāṅṭhi khuli' dilā.// For this reason the village is known as Gāṅṭhuli.
