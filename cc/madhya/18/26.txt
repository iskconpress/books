===== Purport =====

The village named Annakūṭa-grāma is referred to in //Bhakti-ratnākara// (Fifth Wave):

> gopa-gopī bhuñjāyena kautuka apāra
> ei hetu 'āniyora' nāma se ihāra
>
> annakūṭa-sthāna ei dekha śrīnivāsa
> e-sthāna darśane haya pūrṇa abhilāṣa

"It is here that all the //gopīs// and the //gopas// enjoyed wonderful pastimes with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Therefore this place is also called Āniyora. The Annakūṭa ceremony was celebrated here. O Śrīnivāsa, whoever sees this place has all his desires fulfilled." It is also stated:

> kuṇḍera nikaṭa dekha niviḍa-kānana
> ethāi 'gopāla' chilā hañā saṅgopana

"Look at the dense forest near the //kuṇḍa.// It was there that Gopāla was concealed." Also, the //Stavāvalī// (8.75) by Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī states:

> vrajendra-varyārpita-bhogam uccair
> dhṛtvā bṛhat-kāyam aghārir utkaḥ
> vareṇa rādhāṁ chalayan vibhuṅkte
> yatrānna-kūṭaṁ tad ahaṁ prapadye
