According to the Mohammedan scripture, without //evādat,// offering prayers at a mosque or elsewhere five times daily (//namāja//), one cannot be successful in life. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pointed out that in the revealed scripture of the Mohammedans, love of Godhead is the ultimate goal. //Karma-yoga// and //jñāna-yoga// are certainly described in the Koran, but ultimately the Koran states that the ultimate goal is the offering of prayers to the Supreme Person (//evādat//).
