**"But where they are seeing Kṛṣṇa is their mistake. It is like considering a dry tree to be a person."**

===== Purport =====

The word //sthāṇu// means "a dry tree without leaves." From a distance one may mistake such a tree for a person. This is called //sthāṇu-puruṣa.// Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was living in Vṛndāvana, the inhabitants considered Him an ordinary human being, and they mistook the fisherman to be Kṛṣṇa. Every human being is prone to make such mistakes. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was mistaken for an ordinary //sannyāsī,// the fisherman was mistaken for Kṛṣṇa, and the torchlight was mistaken for bright jewels on Kālīya's hoods.
