This proves that bona fide devotional service is based on the conclusions of the Vedic literature. It is not based on the type of sentiment exhibited by the //prākṛta-sahajiyās.// The //prākṛta-sahajiyās// do not consult the Vedic literature, and they are debauchees, woman-hunters and smokers of //gañjā.// Sometimes they give a theatrical performance and cry for the Lord with tears in their eyes. Of course, all scriptural conclusions are washed off by these tears. The //prākṛta-sahajiyās// do not realize that they are violating the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who specifically said that to understand Vṛndāvana and the pastimes of Vṛndāvana one must have sufficient knowledge of the //śāstras// (Vedic scriptures). As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:12|(1.2.12)]], //bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā.// This means that devotional service is acquired from Vedic knowledge. //Tac chraddadhānāḥ munayaḥ.// Devotees who are actually serious attain //bhakti,// scientific devotional service, by hearing Vedic scriptures (//bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā//). It is not that one should create something out of sentimentality, become a //sahajiyā// and advocate such concocted devotional service. However, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura considered such //sahajiyās// to be more favorable than the impersonalists, who are hopelessly atheistic. The impersonalists have no idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The position of the //sahajiyās// is far better than that of the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs.// Although the //sahajiyās// do not think much of Vedic knowledge, they nonetheless have accepted Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, they mislead others from authentic devotional service.
