This Ahovala temple is situated in Dākṣiṇātya, in the district of Karṇula, within the subdivision of Sārbela. Throughout the whole district this very famous temple is much appreciated by the people. There are eight other temples also, and all of them together are called the Nava-nṛsiṁha temples. There is much wonderful architecture and artistic engraving work in these temples. However, as stated in the local gazette, the //Karṇula Manual,// the work is not complete.
