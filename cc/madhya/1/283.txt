There is a special preparation in Bengal wherein chipped rice is mixed with curd and sometimes with //sandeśa// and mango. It is a very palatable food offered to the Deity and then distributed to the public. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, who was a householder at this time, met Nityānanda Prabhu. According to His advice, he executed this festival of //dadhi-ciḍā-prasāda.//
