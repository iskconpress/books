**Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu chastised all the devotees, telling them not to show impudence and spoil the entire world by becoming independent.**

===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu warned all His followers not to become independent or impudent. Unfortunately, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, many //apa-sampradāyas// (so-called followers) invented many ways not approved by the //ācāryas.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has described them as the //āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāni sahajiyā, sakhībhekī, smārta, jāta-gosāñi, ativāḍī, cūḍādhārī// and //gaurāṅga-nāgarī.//

The //āula-sampradāya, bāula-sampradāya// and others invented their own ways of understanding Lord Caitanya's philosophy, without following in the footsteps of the //ācāryas.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself indicates herein that all such attempts would simply spoil the spirit of His cult.
