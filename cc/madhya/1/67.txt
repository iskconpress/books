===== Purport =====

The word //daṇḍa// means rod or pole. A rod or pole falls straight; similarly, when one offers obeisances to his superior with all eight //aṅgas// (parts) of the body, he performs what is called //daṇḍavat.// Sometimes we only speak of //daṇḍavats// but actually do not fall down. In any case, //daṇḍavat// means falling down like a rod before one's superior.
