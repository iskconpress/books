This Vallabha Bhaṭṭa is the head of the Vaiṣṇava //sampradāya// known as the Vallabhācārya-sampradāya in western India. There is a long story about Vallabha Ācārya narrated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// specifically in the Seventh Chapter of //Antya-līlā// and the Nineteenth Chapter of //Madhya-līlā.// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu visited the house of Vallabha Ācārya on the other side of Prayāga, in a place known as Ādāila-grāma. Later, Vallabha Bhaṭṭa saw Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Jagannātha Purī to explain his commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He was very proud of his writings, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu corrected him, telling him that a Vaiṣṇava should be humble and follow in the footsteps of his predecessors. The Lord told him that his pride in being superior to Śrīdhara Svāmī was not at all befitting a Vaiṣṇava.
