===== Purport =====

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī presented themselves as being lower than the two brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi, who were delivered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When Rūpa and Sanātana compared themselves to Jagāi and Mādhāi, they found themselves inferior because the Lord had no trouble in delivering two drunken brothers. This was so because, despite the fact that they were addicted to sinful activity, in other ways their life was brilliant. They belonged to the //brāhmaṇa// caste of Navadvīpa, and such //brāhmaṇas// were pious by nature. Although they had been addicted to some sinful activities due to bad association, those unwanted things could vanish simply because of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Another point for Jagāi and Mādhāi was that, as members of a //brāhmaṇa// family, they did not accept service under anyone. The //śāstras// strictly forbid a //brāhmaṇa// to accept service under anyone. The idea is that by accepting a master, one accepts the occupation of a dog. In other words, a dog cannot thrive without having a master, and for the sake of pleasing the master, dogs offend many people. They bark at innocent people just to please the master. Similarly, when one is a servant, he has to perform abominable activities according to the orders of the master. Therefore, when Dabira Khāsa and Sākara Mallika compared their position to that of Jagāi and Mādhāi, they found Jagāi and Mādhāi's position far better. Jagāi and Mādhāi never accepted the service of a low-class person; nor were they forced to execute abominable activities under the order of a low-class master. Jagāi and Mādhāi chanted the name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by way of blasphemy, but because they simply chanted His name, they immediately became free from the reactions of sinful activities. Thus later they were saved.
