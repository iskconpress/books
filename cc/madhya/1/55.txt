===== Purport =====

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.29.15) it is stated:

> kāmaṁ krodhaṁ bhayaṁ sneham
> aikyaṁ sauhṛdam eva ca
> nityaṁ harau vidadhato
> yānti tan-mayatām hi te

The word //kāma// means lusty desire, //bhaya// means fear, and //krodha// means anger. If one somehow or other approaches Kṛṣṇa, his life becomes successful. The //gopīs// approached Kṛṣṇa with lusty desire. Kṛṣṇa was a very beautiful boy, and they wanted to meet and enjoy His company. But this lusty desire is different from that of the material world. It appears like mundane lust, but in actuality it is the highest form of attraction to Kṛṣṇa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a //sannyāsī;// He left home and everything else. He could certainly not be induced by any mundane lusty desires. So when He used the word //madana-dahane// ("in the fire of lusty desire"), He meant that out of pure love for Kṛṣṇa He was burning in the fire of separation from Kṛṣṇa. Whenever He met Jagannātha, either in the temple or during the Ratha-yātrā, Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to think, "Now I have gotten the Lord of My life and soul."
