===== Purport =====

In those days in Bengal there were many places known as Kānāi Nāṭaśālā, where pictures of the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa were kept. People used to go there to see them. This is called //kṛṣṇa-caritra-līlā.// In Bengal there are still many places called //hari-sabhā,// which indicates a place where local people gather to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and discuss the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The word //kānāi// means "Lord Kṛṣṇa's," and //nāṭaśālā// indicates a place where pastimes are demonstrated. So those places which at the present moment are called //hari-sabhā// may previously have been known as Kānāi Nāṭaśālā.
