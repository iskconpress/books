Clearly these statements are a real account of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of the renounced order of life. His acceptance of this renounced order is not at all comparable to the acceptance of //sannyāsa// by Māyāvādīs. After accepting //sannyāsa,// Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to reach Vṛndāvana. He was unlike the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// who desire to merge into the existence of the Absolute. For a Vaiṣṇava, acceptance of //sannyāsa// means getting relief from all material activities and completely devoting oneself to the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.255): //anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.// For a Vaiṣṇava, the renounced order means completely giving up attachment for material things and engaging nonstop in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// however, do not know how to engage everything in the service of the Lord. Because they have no devotional training, they think material objects to be untouchable. //Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā// The Māyāvādīs think that the world is false, but the Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// do not think like this. Vaiṣṇavas say, "Why should the world be false? It is reality, and it is meant for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." For a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī,// renunciation means not accepting anything for personal sense enjoyment. Devotional service means engaging everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
