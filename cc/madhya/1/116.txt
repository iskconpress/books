It is said that the Sapta-tāla trees arevery old, massive palm trees. There was once a fight between Vāliand his brother Sugrīva, and Lord Rāmacandra took the side of Sugrīva and killed Vāli, keeping Himself behind one of these celebrated trees. When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu toured south India, He embraced these trees, which were delivered and directly promoted to Vaikuṇṭha.
