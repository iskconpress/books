Thus Śrīla Kavirāja Gosvāmī, strictly following in the footsteps of Śrī Vyāsadeva, gives a synopsis of the //līlās// of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// He has given such a description at the end of each canto. In the //Ādi-līlā// he outlined the pastimes of the Lord in the five stages of boyhood, leaving the details of the description to Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Now in this chapter the pastimes that took place at the end of the Lord's life are summarized. These are described in the //Madhya-līlā// and //Antya-līlā.// The rest of the pastimes have been described in a synopsis in the Second Chapter of the //Madhya-līlā.// In this way the author has gradually described both the //madhya-līlā// and the //antya-līlā.//
