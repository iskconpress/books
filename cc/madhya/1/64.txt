//Upala-bhoga// is a particular type of offering performed just behind the Garuḍa-stamba on a stone slab. That stone slab is called the //upala.// All food is offered within the temple room just below the altar of Jagannātha. This //bhoga,// however, was offered on the stone slab within the vision of the public; therefore it is called //upala-bhoga.//
