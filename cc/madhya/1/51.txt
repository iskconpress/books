===== Purport =====

Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed the position of the //gopīs// in separation from Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa left the //gopīs// and went to Mathurā, the //gopīs// cried for Him the rest of their lives, feeling intense separation from Him. This ecstatic feeling of separation was specifically advocated by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu through His actual demonstrations.
