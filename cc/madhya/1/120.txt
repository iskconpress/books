===== Purport =====

In the olden days there were no presses, and all the important scriptures were handwritten and kept in large temples. Caitanya Mahāprabhu found //Brahma-saṁhitā// and //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// in handwritten texts, and knowing them to be very authoritative, He took them with Him to present to His devotees. Of course, He obtained the permission of the temple commander. Now both //Brahma-saṁhitā// and //Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// are available in print with commentaries by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.
