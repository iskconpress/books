===== Purport =====

In the First Wave of the book known as //Bhakti-ratnākara,// it is said that Sanātana Gosvāmī understood //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by thorough study and explained it in his commentary known as //Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī// All the knowledge that Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī directly acquired from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was broadcast all over the world by their expert service. Sanātana Gosvāmī gave his //Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī// commentary to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī for editing, and Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī edited this under the name of //Laghu-toṣaṇī.// Whatever he immediately put down in writing was finished in the year 1476 Śaka (A.D. 1555). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī completed //Laghu-toṣaṇī// in the year Śakābda 1504 (A.D. 1583).

The subject matter of the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// by Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, was collected by Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī and is known as a //vaiṣṇava-smṛti.// This //vaiṣṇava-smṛti-grantha// was finished in twenty chapters, known as //vilāsas.// In the first //vilāsa// there is a description of how a relationship is established between the spiritual master and the disciple, and //mantras// are explained. In the second //vilāsa,// the process of initiation is described. In the third //vilāsa,// the methods of Vaiṣṇava behavior are given, with emphasis on cleanliness, constant remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the chanting of the //mantras// given by the initiating spiritual master. In the fourth //vilāsa// are descriptions of //saṁskāra,// the reformatory method; //tilaka,// the application of twelve //tilakas// on twelve places of the body; //mudrā,// marks on the body; //mālā,// chanting with beads; and //guru-pūjā,// worship of the spiritual master. In the fifth //vilāsa,// one is instructed on how to make a place to sit for meditation, and there are descriptions of breathing exercises, meditation and worship of the //śālagrāma-śilā// representation of Lord Viṣṇu. In the sixth //vilāsa,// the required practices for inviting the transcendental form of the Lord and bathing Him are given. In the seventh //vilāsa,// one is instructed on how to collect flowers used for the worship of Lord Viṣṇu. In the eighth //vilāsa,// there is a description of the Deity and instructions on how to set up incense, light lamps, make offerings, dance, play music, beat drums, garland the Deity, offer prayers and obeisances and counteract offenses. In the ninth //vilāsa,// there are descriptions about collecting //tulasī// leaves, offering oblations to forefathers according to Vaiṣṇava rituals, and offering food. In the tenth //vilāsa// there are descriptions of the devotees of the Lord (Vaiṣṇavas, or saintly persons). In the eleventh //vilāsa,// there are elaborate descriptions of Deity worship and the glories of the holy name of the Lord. One is instructed on how to chant the holy name of the Deity, and there are discussions about offenses committed while chanting the holy name, along with methods for getting relief from such offenses. There are also descriptions of the glories of devotional service and the surrendering process. In the twelfth //vilāsa,// Ekādaśī is described. In the thirteenth //vilāsa,// fasting is discussed, as well as observance of the Mahā-dvādaśī ceremony. In the fourteenth //vilāsa,// different duties for different months are outlined. In the fifteenth //vilāsa,// there are instructions on how to observe Ekādaśī fasting without even drinking water. There are also descriptions of branding the body with the symbols of Viṣṇu, discussions of Cāturmāsya observations during the rainy season, and discussions of Janmāṣṭamī, Pārśvaikādaśī, Śravaṇā-dvādaśī, Rāma-navamī and Vijayā-daśamī. The sixteenth //vilāsa// discusses duties to be observed in the month of Kārttika (October-November), or the Dāmodara month, or Ūrja, when lamps are offered in the Deity room or above the temple. There are also descriptions of the Govardhana-pūjā and Ratha-yātrā. The seventeenth //vilāsa// discusses preparations for Deity worship, //mahā-mantra// chanting and the process of //japa.// In the eighteenth //vilāsa// the different forms of Śrī Viṣṇu are described. The nineteenth //vilāsa// discusses the establishment of the Deity and the rituals observed in bathing the Deity before installation. The twentieth //vilāsa// discusses the construction of temples, referring to those constructed by the great devotees. The details of the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa-grantha// are given by Śrī Kavirāja Gosvāmī in the //Madhya-līlā// (24.329-345). The descriptions given in those verses by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī are actually a description of those portions compiled by Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī. According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the regulative principles of devotional service compiled by Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī do not strictly follow our Vaiṣṇava principles. Actually, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī collected only a summary of the elaborate descriptions of Vaiṣṇava regulative principles from the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.// It is Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī's opinion, however, that to follow the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// strictly is to actually follow the Vaiṣṇava rituals in perfect order. He claims that the //smārta-samāja,// which is strictly followed by caste //brāhmaṇas,// has influenced portions that Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī collected from the original //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.// It is therefore very difficult to find out Vaiṣṇava directions from the book of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī. It is better to consult the commentary made by Sanātana Gosvāmī himself for the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// under the name of //Dig-darśinī-ṭīkā.// Some say that the same commentary was compiled by Gopīnātha-pūjā Adhikārī, who was engaged in the service of Śrī Rādhā-ramaṇajī and who happened to be one of the disciples of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī.

Regarding the //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta,// there are two parts dealing with the discharge of devotional service. The first part is an analytical study of devotional service, in which there is also a description of different planets, including the earth, the heavenly planets, Brahma-loka and Vaikuṇṭha-loka. There are also descriptions of the devotees, including intimate devotees, most intimate devotees and complete devotees. The second part describes the glories of the spiritual world, known as //Goloka-māhātmya-nirūpaṇa,// as well as the process of renunciation of the material world. It also describes real knowledge, devotional service, the spiritual world, love of Godhead, attainment of life's destination, and the bliss of the world. In this way there are seven chapters in each part, fourteen chapters in all.

Daśama-ṭippanī is a commentary on the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Another name for this commentary is //Bṛhad-vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī-ṭīkā.// In the //Bhakti-ratnākara,// it is said that //Daśama-ṭippanī// was finished in 1476 Śakābda (A.D. 1555).
