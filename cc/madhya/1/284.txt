In this regard, Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī writes in //Vilāpa-kusumāñjali// (5):

> yo māṁ dustara-geha-nirjala-mahā-kūpād apāra-klamāt
> sadyaḥ sāndra-dayāmbudhiḥ prakṛtitaḥ svairīkṛpā-rajjubhiḥ
> uddhṛtyātma-saroja-nindi-caraṇa-prāntaṁ prapadya svayaṁ
> śrī-dāmodara-sac cakāra tam ahaṁ caitanya-candraṁ bhaje

"Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who, by His unreserved mercy, kindly saved me from household life, which is exactly like a blind well without water, and placed me in the ocean of transcendental joy under the care of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī."
