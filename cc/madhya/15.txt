~~Title:Cc. Madhya 15: The Lord Accepts Prasāda at the House of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya~~

====== The Lord Accepts Prasāda at the House of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya ======

The following summary of this chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.// After the Ratha-yātrā festival, Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu worshiped Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with flowers and //tulasī.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in return, worshiped Advaita Ācārya with the flowers and //tulasī// that remained on the offered plate and said a //mantra, yo 'si so 'si// ("What You are, You are"). Then Advaita Ācārya Prabhu invited Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for //prasāda.// When Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees performed the Nandotsava ceremony, the Lord personally dressed Himself as a cowherd boy. Thus the ceremony was very jubilant. Then the Lord and His devotees observed Vijayādaśamī, the day of victory when Lord Rāmacandra conquered Laṅkā. The devotees all became soldiers of Lord Rāmacandra, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in the ecstasy of Hanumān, manifested various transcendentally blissful activities. Thereafter, the Lord and His devotees observed various other ceremonies.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked all the devotees to return to Bengal. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sent Nityānanda Prabhu to Bengal for preaching and also sent Rāmadāsa, Gadādhara dāsa and several other devotees with Him. Then Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, with great humility, sent some Jagannātha //prasāda// and a cloth from Lord Jagannātha to His mother through Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. When the Lord bade farewell to Rāghava Paṇḍita, Vāsudeva Datta, the residents of Kulīnagrāma and other devotees, He praised them for their transcendental qualities. Rāmānanda Vasu and Satyarāja Khān asked some questions, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed them that all householder devotees must engage themselves in the service of Vaiṣṇavas exclusively devoted to chanting the holy name of the Lord. He also directed the Vaiṣṇavas from Khaṇḍa, instructed Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Vidyā-vācaspati, and praised Murāri Gupta for his firm faith in the lotus feet of Lord Rāmacandra. Considering the humble prayer of Vāsudeva Datta, He established that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is qualified to deliver all the conditioned souls.

Thereafter, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was accepting //prasāda// at the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Sārvabhauma's son-in-law, Amogha, created trouble in the family with his criticisms. The following morning, he was attacked by the disease of //visūcikā// (cholera). Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very kindly saved him from death and enlivened him in chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was accepting prasāda at the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Amogha criticized Him. At that time the Lord also showed how much He was obliged to His devotees.

  ; [[.15:2|Cc. Madhya 15.2]]
  : All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda Prabhu! All glories to Advaitacandra! And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

  ; [[.15:3|Cc. Madhya 15.3]]
  : All glories to the listeners of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta who have accepted it as their life and soul.

  ; [[.15:4|Cc. Madhya 15.4]]
  : While Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed at Jagannātha Purī, He constantly enjoyed chanting and dancing with His devotees.

  ; [[.15:5|Cc. Madhya 15.5]]
  : In the beginning, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the Deity of Lord Jagannātha in the temple. He offered Him obeisances and prayers and danced and sang before Him.

  ; [[.15:6|Cc. Madhya 15.6]]
  : After visiting the temple, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would remain outside during the upala-bhoga offering. He would then go meet Haridāsa Ṭhākura and return to His residence.

  ; [[.15:7|Cc. Madhya 15.7]]
  : Sitting in His room, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would chant on His beads, and Advaita Prabhu would come there to worship the Lord.

  ; [[.15:8|Cc. Madhya 15.8]]
  : While worshiping Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Advaita Ācārya would offer Him scented water to wash His mouth and feet. Then Advaita Ācārya would smear very fragrant sandalwood pulp all over His body.

  ; [[.15:9|Cc. Madhya 15.9]]
  : Śrī Advaita Prabhu would also place a flower garland around the Lord's neck and tulasī flowers [mañjarīs] on His head. Then, with folded hands, Advaita Ācārya would offer obeisances and prayers unto the Lord.

  ; [[.15:10|Cc. Madhya 15.10]]
  : After being worshiped by Advaita Ācārya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would take the dish containing flowers and tulasī and, with whatever paraphernalia remained, would also worship Advaita Ācārya.

  ; [[.15:11|Cc. Madhya 15.11]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would worship Advaita Ācārya by chanting the mantra, "Whatever You are, You are---but I offer My respects unto You." In addition, the Lord would make some sounds within His mouth that would make Advaita Ācārya laugh.

  ; [[.15:12|Cc. Madhya 15.12]]
  : In this way both Advaita Ācārya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu would offer Their respectful obeisances unto one another. Then Advaita Ācārya would extend invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again and again.

  ; [[.15:13|Cc. Madhya 15.13]]
  : Indeed, Śrī Advaita Ācārya's invitation is another wonderful story. It has been very vividly described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura.

  ; [[.15:14|Cc. Madhya 15.14]]
  : Since Advaita Ācārya's invitation has been described by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, I shall not repeat the story. However, I shall say that other devotees also extended invitations to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.15:15|Cc. Madhya 15.15]]
  : Every day one devotee after another would invite Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the other devotees to lunch and would also hold a festival.

  ; [[.15:16|Cc. Madhya 15.16]]
  : All the devotees remained at Jagannātha Purī for four continuous months, and they observed all Lord Jagannātha's festivals with great pleasure.

  ; [[.15:17|Cc. Madhya 15.17]]
  : The devotees also celebrated the festival of Janmāṣṭamī, Kṛṣṇa's birthday, which is also called Nanda-mahotsava, the festival of Nanda Mahārāja. At that time Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees dressed themselves as cowherd boys.

  ; [[.15:18|Cc. Madhya 15.18]]
  : Having dressed up like cowherd boys, all the devotees carried pots of milk and yogurt balanced on rods over their shoulders. Thus they all arrived at the festival grounds chanting the holy name of Hari.

  ; [[.15:19|Cc. Madhya 15.19]]
  : Kānāñi Khuṭiyā dressed himself like Nanda Mahārāja, and Jagannātha Māhāti dressed himself as mother Yaśodā.

  ; [[.15:20|Cc. Madhya 15.20]]
  : At that time, King Pratāparudra was also personally present with Kāśī Miśra, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Tulasī Paḍichāpātra.

  ; [[.15:21|Cc. Madhya 15.21]]
  : As usual, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu danced jubilantly. Everyone was covered with milk, yogurt and yellow turmeric water.

  ; [[.15:22|Cc. Madhya 15.22]]
  : It was at this time that Śrīla Advaita Ācārya said, "Please do not be angry. I speak the truth. I shall know whether You are a cowherd boy only if You can wheel this rod about."

  ; [[.15:23|Cc. Madhya 15.23]]
  : Accepting Advaita Ācārya's challenge, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took a big rod and began to wheel it around and around. Again and again He threw the rod into the sky and caught it when it fell.

  ; [[.15:24|Cc. Madhya 15.24]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wheeled and threw the rod, sometimes over His head, sometimes behind His back, sometimes in front of Him, sometimes to His side and sometimes between His legs. Indeed, all the people laughed to see this.

  ; [[.15:25|Cc. Madhya 15.25]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu whirled the rod in a circle like a firebrand, the heart of everyone who saw it was astonished.

  ; [[.15:26|Cc. Madhya 15.26]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu also played at whirling the rod. Who can understand how They were ecstatically immersed in the deep emotions of the cowherd boys?

  ; [[.15:27|Cc. Madhya 15.27]]
  : Following the orders of Mahārāja Pratāparudra, the temple superintendent named Tulasī brought one of Lord Jagannātha's used cloths.

  ; [[.15:28|Cc. Madhya 15.28]]
  : This valuable cloth was wrapped around the head of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The other devotees, headed by Advaita Ācārya, also had cloths wrapped about their heads.

  ; [[.15:29|Cc. Madhya 15.29]]
  : In ecstasy, Kānāñi Khuṭiyā, who was dressed as Nanda Mahārāja, and Jagannātha Māhāti, who was dressed as mother Yaśodā, distributed all the riches they had stocked at home.

  ; [[.15:30|Cc. Madhya 15.30]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was greatly satisfied to see this. Accepting them both as His father and mother, He offered them obeisances.

  ; [[.15:31|Cc. Madhya 15.31]]
  : In great ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned to His residence. In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, known as Gaurāṅga-sundara, performed various pastimes.

  ; [[.15:32|Cc. Madhya 15.32]]
  : On the victory day celebrating the conquest of Laṅkā-a day known as Vijayā-daśamī-Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu dressed up all His devotees like monkey soldiers.

  ; [[.15:33|Cc. Madhya 15.33]]
  : Displaying the emotions of Hanumān, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took up a large tree branch, and, mounting the walls of the Laṅkā fort, began to dismantle it.

  ; [[.15:34|Cc. Madhya 15.34]]
  : In the ecstasy of Hanumān, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu angrily said, "Where is the rascal Rāvaṇa? He has kidnapped the universal mother, Sītā. Now I shall kill him and all his family."

  ; [[.15:35|Cc. Madhya 15.35]]
  : Everyone became very astonished to see the emotional ecstasy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and everyone began to chant, "All glories! All glories!" again and again.

  ; [[.15:36|Cc. Madhya 15.36]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His devotees participated in all the festivals known as Rāsa-yātrā, Dīpāvalī and Utthāna-dvādaśī.

  ; [[.15:37|Cc. Madhya 15.37]]
  : One day the two brothers, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, consulted one another, sitting together in a solitary place.

  ; [[.15:38|Cc. Madhya 15.38]]
  : No one could understand what the brothers discussed between Themselves, but later all the devotees could guess what the subject matter was.

  ; [[.15:39|Cc. Madhya 15.39]]
  : Thereafter, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu called for all the devotees and asked them to return to Bengal. In this way, He bade farewell to them.

  ; [[.15:40|Cc. Madhya 15.40]]
  : Bidding farewell to all the devotees, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested them to return to Jagannātha Purī every year to see Him and then see the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā temple.

  ; [[.15:41|Cc. Madhya 15.41]]
  : With great respect, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Advaita Ācārya, "Give Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotion to Kṛṣṇa, even to the lowest of men [caṇḍālas]."

  ; [[.15:42|Cc. Madhya 15.42]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Nityānanda Prabhu, "Go to Bengal and, without restriction, manifest devotional service to the Lord, Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

  ; [[.15:43|Cc. Madhya 15.43]]
  : Nityānanda Prabhu was given assistants like Rāmadāsa, Gadādhara dāsa and several others. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I give them to You to assist You.

  ; [[.15:44|Cc. Madhya 15.44]]
  : "I shall also go to see You at intervals. Keeping Myself invisible, I shall watch You dance."

  ; [[.15:45|Cc. Madhya 15.45]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then embraced Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and, with His arm about his neck, began to speak to him in sweet words.

  ; [[.15:46|Cc. Madhya 15.46]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, "Perform congregational chanting daily, and be assured that I shall also dance in your presence. You will be able to see this dancing, but not others.

  ; [[.15:47|Cc. Madhya 15.47]]
  : "Take this prasāda of Lord Jagannātha's and this cloth and deliver them to My mother, Śacīdevī. After offering her obeisances, please request her to excuse My offenses.

  ; [[.15:48|Cc. Madhya 15.48]]
  : "I have given up the service of My mother and have accepted the sannyāsa order. Actually I should not have done this, for by so doing, I have destroyed My religious principles.

  ; [[.15:49|Cc. Madhya 15.49]]
  : "I am subordinate to the love of My mother, and it is My duty to serve her in return. Instead of doing so, I have accepted this renounced order. Certainly this is the act of a madman.

  ; [[.15:50|Cc. Madhya 15.50]]
  : "A mother is not offended by her mad son, and, knowing this, My mother is not offended by Me.

  ; [[.15:51|Cc. Madhya 15.51]]
  : "I had no business in accepting this renounced order and sacrificing My love for My mother, which is My real property. Actually I was in a crazy state of mind when I accepted sannyāsa.

  ; [[.15:52|Cc. Madhya 15.52]]
  : "I am staying here at Jagannātha Purī, Nīlācala, to comply with her orders. However, at intervals I shall go see her lotus feet.

  ; [[.15:53|Cc. Madhya 15.53]]
  : "Indeed, I go there daily to see her lotus feet. She is able to feel My presence, although she does not believe it to be true.

  ; [[.15:54-55|Cc. Madhya 15.54-55]]
  : "One day My mother, Śacī, offered food to Śālagrāma Viṣṇu. She offered rice cooked from śāli paddies, various kinds of vegetables, spinach, curry made of banana flowers, fried paṭola with nimba leaves, pieces of ginger with lemon, and also yogurt, milk, sugar candy and many other foods.

  ; [[.15:56|Cc. Madhya 15.56]]
  : "Taking the food upon her lap, Mother was crying to think that all that food was very dear to her Nimāi.

  ; [[.15:57|Cc. Madhya 15.57]]
  : "My mother was thinking, 'Nimāi is not here. Who will accept all this food?' As she meditated upon Me in this way, her eyes filled with tears.

  ; [[.15:58|Cc. Madhya 15.58]]
  : "While she was thus thinking and crying, I immediately went there with great haste and ate everything. Seeing the dish empty, she wiped her tears away.

  ; [[.15:59|Cc. Madhya 15.59]]
  : "She then began to wonder who had eaten all that food. 'Why is the plate empty?' she wondered, doubting that Bāla-gopāla had eaten it all.

  ; [[.15:60|Cc. Madhya 15.60]]
  : "She began to wonder whether there was actually anything on the plate in the first place. Then again she thought that some animal might have come and eaten everything.

  ; [[.15:61|Cc. Madhya 15.61]]
  : "She thought, 'Perhaps by mistake I did not put any food on the plate.' So thinking, she went into the kitchen and saw the pots.

  ; [[.15:62|Cc. Madhya 15.62]]
  : "When she saw that all the pots were still filled with rice and vegetables, there was some doubt in her mind, and she was astonished.

  ; [[.15:63|Cc. Madhya 15.63]]
  : "Thus wondering, she called Īśāna, the servant, and had the place cleaned again. She then offered another plate to Gopāla.

  ; [[.15:64|Cc. Madhya 15.64]]
  : "Now whenever she prepares some good cooked food and wants to feed it to Me, she cries in great anxiety.

  ; [[.15:65|Cc. Madhya 15.65]]
  : "Being obliged by her love, I am brought there to eat. Mother knows all these things internally and feels happiness, but externally she does not accept them.

  ; [[.15:66|Cc. Madhya 15.66]]
  : "Such an incident took place on the last Vijayā-daśamī day. You can ask her about this incident and thus make her believe that I actually go there."

  ; [[.15:67|Cc. Madhya 15.67]]
  : While describing all this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a little overwhelmed, but just to finish bidding farewell to the devotees, He remained patient.

  ; [[.15:68|Cc. Madhya 15.68]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next spoke some relishable words to Rāghava Paṇḍita. He said, "I am obliged to you due to your pure love for Me."

  ; [[.15:69|Cc. Madhya 15.69]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then informed everyone, "Just hear about the pure devotional service rendered to Kṛṣṇa by Rāghava Paṇḍita. Indeed, Rāghava Paṇḍita's service is supremely pure and highly accomplished.

  ; [[.15:70|Cc. Madhya 15.70]]
  : "Apart from other commodities, just hear about his coconut offering. A coconut is sold at the rate of five gaṇḍās each.

  ; [[.15:71|Cc. Madhya 15.71]]
  : "Although he already has hundreds of trees and millions of fruits, he is still very eager to hear about the place where sweet coconut is available.

  ; [[.15:72|Cc. Madhya 15.72]]
  : "He collects coconut with great endeavor from a place twenty miles away, and he gives four paṇas each for them.

  ; [[.15:73|Cc. Madhya 15.73]]
  : "Every day five to seven coconuts are clipped and put into water to keep cool.

  ; [[.15:74|Cc. Madhya 15.74]]
  : "At the time of offering bhoga, the coconuts are again clipped and cleansed. After holes are made in them, they are offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:75|Cc. Madhya 15.75]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa used to drink the juice from these coconuts, and sometimes the coconuts were left drained of juice. At other times the coconuts were filled with juice.

  ; [[.15:76|Cc. Madhya 15.76]]
  : "When Rāghava Paṇḍita saw that the juice had been drunk from the coconuts, he was very pleased. He would then break the coconut, take out the pulp and put it on another plate.

  ; [[.15:77|Cc. Madhya 15.77]]
  : "After offering the pulp, he would meditate outside the temple door. In the meantime, Lord Kṛṣṇa, having eaten the pulp, would leave the plate empty.

  ; [[.15:78|Cc. Madhya 15.78]]
  : "Sometimes, after eating the pulp, Kṛṣṇa would fill the plate again with new pulp. In this way, Rāghava Paṇḍita's faith increases, and he floats in an ocean of love.

  ; [[.15:79|Cc. Madhya 15.79]]
  : "One day it so happened that about ten coconuts were properly clipped and brought by a servant to offer to the Deity.

  ; [[.15:80|Cc. Madhya 15.80]]
  : "When the coconuts were brought, there was little time to offer them because it was already late. The servant, holding the container of coconuts, remained standing at the door.

  ; [[.15:81|Cc. Madhya 15.81]]
  : "Rāghava Paṇḍita then saw that the servant touched the ceiling above the door and then touched the coconuts with the same hand.

  ; [[.15:82|Cc. Madhya 15.82]]
  : "Rāghava Paṇḍita then said, 'People are always coming and going through that door. The dust from their feet blows up and touches the ceiling.

  ; [[.15:83|Cc. Madhya 15.83]]
  : " 'After touching the ceiling above the door, you have touched the coconuts. Now they are no longer fit to be offered to Kṛṣṇa because they are contaminated.'

  ; [[.15:84|Cc. Madhya 15.84]]
  : "Such was the service of Rāghava Paṇḍita. He did not accept the coconuts but threw them over the wall. His service is purely based on unalloyed love, and it conquers the whole world.

  ; [[.15:85|Cc. Madhya 15.85]]
  : "Thereafter, Rāghava Paṇḍita had other coconuts gathered, cleansed and clipped, and with great attention he offered them to the Deity to eat.

  ; [[.15:86|Cc. Madhya 15.86]]
  : "In this way he collected excellent bananas, mangoes, oranges, jackfruits and whatever first-class fruits from distant villages he had heard about.

  ; [[.15:87|Cc. Madhya 15.87]]
  : "All these fruits were collected from distant places and were bought at a high price. After trimming them with great care and purity, Rāghava Paṇḍita offered them to the Deity.

  ; [[.15:88|Cc. Madhya 15.88]]
  : "Thus with great care and attention Rāghava Paṇḍita would prepare spinach, other vegetables, radishes, fruits, chipped rice, powdered rice and sweetmeats.

  ; [[.15:89|Cc. Madhya 15.89]]
  : "He prepared cakes, sweet rice, concentrated milk and everything else with great attention, and the cooking conditions were purified so that the food was first class and tasteful.

  ; [[.15:90|Cc. Madhya 15.90]]
  : "Rāghava Paṇḍita would also offer all kinds of pickles, such as kāśamdi. He offered various scents, garments, ornaments and the best of everything.

  ; [[.15:91|Cc. Madhya 15.91]]
  : "Thus Rāghava Paṇḍita would serve the Lord in an incomparable way. Everyone was very satisfied just to see him."

  ; [[.15:92|Cc. Madhya 15.92]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then mercifully embraced Rāghava Paṇḍita. The Lord also offered all the other devotees a reception with similar respect.

  ; [[.15:93|Cc. Madhya 15.93]]
  : The Lord also respectfully told Śivānanda Sena, "Take care of Vāsudeva Datta very nicely.

  ; [[.15:94|Cc. Madhya 15.94]]
  : "Vāsudeva Datta is very liberal. Every day, whatever income he receives, he spends. He does not keep any balance.

  ; [[.15:95|Cc. Madhya 15.95]]
  : "Being a householder, Vāsudeva Datta needs to save some money. Because he is not doing so, it is very difficult for him to maintain his family.

  ; [[.15:96|Cc. Madhya 15.96]]
  : "Please take care of Vāsudeva Datta's family affairs. Become his manager and make the proper adjustments.

  ; [[.15:97|Cc. Madhya 15.97]]
  : "Come every year and bring all My devotees with you to the Guṇḍicā festival. I also request you to maintain all of them."

  ; [[.15:98|Cc. Madhya 15.98]]
  : The Lord then with great respect extended an invitation to all the inhabitants of Kulīna-grāma, asking them to come every year and bring silken rope to carry Lord Jagannātha during the Ratha-yātrā festival.

  ; [[.15:99|Cc. Madhya 15.99]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "Guṇarāja Khān of Kulīna-grāma compiled a book named Śrī Kṛṣṇa-vijaya in which there is a sentence revealing the author's ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.15:100|Cc. Madhya 15.100]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, " 'Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, is my life and soul.' By this statement I am sold into the hands of the descendants of Guṇarāja Khān.

  ; [[.15:101|Cc. Madhya 15.101]]
  : "To say nothing of you, even a dog living in your village is very dear to Me. What, then, to speak of others?"

  ; [[.15:102|Cc. Madhya 15.102]]
  : After this, Rāmānanda Vasu and Satyarāja Khān both submitted questions at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.15:103|Cc. Madhya 15.103]]
  : Satyarāja Khān said, "My dear Lord, being a householder and a materialistic man, I do not know the process of advancing in spiritual life. I therefore submit myself unto Your lotus feet and request You to give me orders."

  ; [[.15:104|Cc. Madhya 15.104]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Without cessation continue chanting the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Whenever possible, serve Him and His devotees, the Vaiṣṇavas."

  ; [[.15:105|Cc. Madhya 15.105]]
  : Upon hearing this, Satyarāja said, "How can I recognize a Vaiṣṇava? Please let me know what a Vaiṣṇava is. What are his common symptoms?"

  ; [[.15:106|Cc. Madhya 15.106]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "Whoever chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa just once is worshipable and is the topmost human being.

  ; [[.15:107|Cc. Madhya 15.107]]
  : "Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, one is relieved from all the reactions of a sinful life. One can complete the nine processes of devotional service simply by chanting the holy name.

  ; [[.15:108|Cc. Madhya 15.108]]
  : "One does not have to undergo initiation or execute the activities required before initiation. One simply has to vibrate the holy name with his lips. Thus even a man in the lowest class [caṇḍāla] can be delivered.

  ; [[.15:109|Cc. Madhya 15.109]]
  : "By chanting the holy name of the Lord, one dissolves his entanglement in material activities. After this, one becomes very attracted to Kṛṣṇa, and thus dormant love for Kṛṣṇa is awakened.

  ; [[.15:110|Cc. Madhya 15.110]]
  : " 'The holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa is an attractive feature for many saintly, liberal people. It is the annihilator of all sinful reactions and is so powerful that save for the dumb who cannot chant it, it is readily available to everyone, including the lowest type of man, the caṇḍāla. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is the controller of the opulence of liberation, and it is identical with Kṛṣṇa. Simply by touching the holy name with one's tongue, immediate effects are produced. Chanting the holy name does not depend on initiation, pious activities or the puraścaryā regulative principles generally observed before initiation. The holy name does not wait for all these activities. It is self-sufficient.' "

  ; [[.15:111|Cc. Madhya 15.111]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then finally advised, "One who is chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is understood to be a Vaiṣṇava; therefore you should offer all respects to him."

  ; [[.15:112|Cc. Madhya 15.112]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then turned His attention to three persons-Mukunda dāsa, Raghunandana and Śrī Narahari-inhabitants of the place called Khaṇḍa.

  ; [[.15:113|Cc. Madhya 15.113]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the son of mother Śacī, next asked Mukunda dāsa, "You are the father, and your son is Raghunandana. Is that so?

  ; [[.15:114|Cc. Madhya 15.114]]
  : "Or is Śrīla Raghunandana your father whereas you are his son? Please let Me know the facts so that My doubts will go away."

  ; [[.15:115|Cc. Madhya 15.115]]
  : Mukunda replied, "Raghunandana is my father, and I am his son. This is my decision.

  ; [[.15:116|Cc. Madhya 15.116]]
  : "All of us have attained devotion to Kṛṣṇa due to Raghunandana. Therefore in my mind he is my father."

  ; [[.15:117|Cc. Madhya 15.117]]
  : Hearing Mukunda dāsa give this proper decision, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirmed it, saying, "Yes, it is correct. One who awakens devotion to Kṛṣṇa is certainly a spiritual master."

  ; [[.15:118|Cc. Madhya 15.118]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very happy just to speak of the glories of His devotees. Indeed, when He spoke of their glories, it was as if He had five faces.

  ; [[.15:119|Cc. Madhya 15.119]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then informed all His devotees, "Please hear about Mukunda's love of Godhead. It is a very deep and pure love and can only be compared with purified gold.

  ; [[.15:120|Cc. Madhya 15.120]]
  : "Mukunda dāsa externally appears to be a royal physician engaged in governmental service, but internally he has a deep love for Kṛṣṇa. Who can understand his love?

  ; [[.15:121|Cc. Madhya 15.121]]
  : "One day Mukunda dāsa, the royal physician, was seated with the Mohammedan King on a high platform and was telling the King about medical treatment.

  ; [[.15:122|Cc. Madhya 15.122]]
  : "While the King and Mukunda dāsa were conversing, a servant brought a fan made of peacock feathers to shade the head of the King from the sun. Consequently he held the fan above the King's head.

  ; [[.15:123|Cc. Madhya 15.123]]
  : "Just by seeing the peacock-feathered fan, Mukunda dāsa became absorbed in ecstatic love of Godhead and fell from the high platform onto the ground.

  ; [[.15:124|Cc. Madhya 15.124]]
  : "The King, fearing that the royal physician was killed, personally descended and brought him to his consciousness.

  ; [[.15:125|Cc. Madhya 15.125]]
  : "When the King asked Mukunda, 'Where is it paining you?' Mukunda replied, 'I am not very much pained.'

  ; [[.15:126|Cc. Madhya 15.126]]
  : "The King then inquired, 'Mukunda, why did you fall down?' Mukunda replied, 'My dear King, I have a disease that is like epilepsy.'

  ; [[.15:127|Cc. Madhya 15.127]]
  : "Being extraordinarily intelligent, the King could understand the whole affair. In his estimation, Mukunda was a most uncommon, exalted, liberated personality.

  ; [[.15:128-129|Cc. Madhya 15.128-129]]
  : "Raghunandana is constantly engaged in serving the temple of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Beside the entrance of the temple is a lake, and on its banks is a kadamba tree, which daily delivers two flowers to be used for Kṛṣṇa's service."

  ; [[.15:130|Cc. Madhya 15.130]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again spoke to Mukunda with sweet words: "Your duty is to earn both material and spiritual wealth.

  ; [[.15:131|Cc. Madhya 15.131]]
  : "Furthermore it is the duty of Raghunandana to always engage in Lord Kṛṣṇa's service. He has no other intention but the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.15:132|Cc. Madhya 15.132]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then ordered Narahari: "I wish you to remain here with My devotees. In this way the three of you should always execute these three duties for the service of the Lord."

  ; [[.15:133|Cc. Madhya 15.133]]
  : Out of His causeless mercy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave the following directions to the brothers Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Vidyā-vācaspati.

  ; [[.15:134|Cc. Madhya 15.134]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "In this Age of Kali, Kṛṣṇa is manifest in two forms-wood and water. Thus He helps conditioned souls to become liberated by seeing the wood and bathing in the water.

  ; [[.15:135|Cc. Madhya 15.135]]
  : "Lord Jagannātha is the Supreme Lord Himself in the form of wood, and the River Ganges is the Supreme Lord Himself in the form of water.

  ; [[.15:136|Cc. Madhya 15.136]]
  : "Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, you should engage in the worship of Lord Jagannātha Puruṣottama, and Vācaspati should worship mother Ganges."

  ; [[.15:137|Cc. Madhya 15.137]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then embraced Murāri Gupta and began to speak about his firm faith in devotional service. This was heard by all the devotees.

  ; [[.15:138|Cc. Madhya 15.138]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Previously I induced Murāri Gupta again and again to be allured by Lord Kṛṣṇa. I said to him, 'My dear Gupta, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-kumāra, is the supreme sweetness.

  ; [[.15:139|Cc. Madhya 15.139]]
  : " 'Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of all incarnations and the source of everything. He is pure transcendental love itself, and He is the reservoir of all pleasure.

  ; [[.15:140|Cc. Madhya 15.140]]
  : " 'Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. He is like a mine of gems. He is expert at everything, very intelligent and sober, and He is the summit of all humors.

  ; [[.15:141|Cc. Madhya 15.141]]
  : " 'His character is very sweet, and His pastimes are melodious. He is expert in intelligence, and thus He enjoys all His pastimes and mellows.'

  ; [[.15:142|Cc. Madhya 15.142]]
  : "I then requested Murāri Gupta, 'Worship Kṛṣṇa and take shelter of Him. But for His service, nothing appeals to the mind.'

  ; [[.15:143|Cc. Madhya 15.143]]
  : "In this way, he heard from Me again and again. By My influence, his mind was a little converted.

  ; [[.15:144|Cc. Madhya 15.144]]
  : "Murāri Gupta then replied, 'I am Your servant and Your order carrier. I have no independent existence.'

  ; [[.15:145|Cc. Madhya 15.145]]
  : "After this, Murāri Gupta went home and spent the whole night thinking how he would be able to give up the association of Raghunātha, Lord Rāmacandra. Thus he was overwhelmed.

  ; [[.15:146|Cc. Madhya 15.146]]
  : "Murāri Gupta then began to pray at the lotus feet of Lord Rāmacandra. He prayed that death would come that night because it was not possible for him to give up the service of the lotus feet of Raghunātha.

  ; [[.15:147|Cc. Madhya 15.147]]
  : "Thus Murāri Gupta cried the entire night. There was no rest for his mind; therefore he could not sleep but stayed awake the entire night.

  ; [[.15:148|Cc. Madhya 15.148]]
  : "In the morning Murāri Gupta came to see Me. Catching hold of My feet and crying, he submitted an appeal.

  ; [[.15:149|Cc. Madhya 15.149]]
  : "Murāri Gupta said, 'I have sold my head to the lotus feet of Raghunātha. I cannot withdraw my head, for that would give me too much pain.

  ; [[.15:150|Cc. Madhya 15.150]]
  : " 'It is not possible for me to give up the service of Raghunātha's lotus feet. At the same time, if I do not do so I shall break your order. What can I do?'

  ; [[.15:151|Cc. Madhya 15.151]]
  : "In this way Murāri Gupta appealed to Me, saying, 'Kindly grant me this mercy because You are all-merciful. Let me die before You so that all my doubts will be finished.'

  ; [[.15:152|Cc. Madhya 15.152]]
  : "Hearing this, I became very happy. I then raised Murāri Gupta and embraced him.

  ; [[.15:153|Cc. Madhya 15.153]]
  : "I said to him, 'All glories to you, Murāri Gupta! Your method of worship is very firmly fixed-so much so that even upon My request your mind did not turn.

  ; [[.15:154|Cc. Madhya 15.154]]
  : " 'The servitor must have love and affection for the lotus feet of the Lord exactly like this. Even if the Lord wants separation, a devotee cannot abandon the shelter of His lotus feet.

  ; [[.15:155|Cc. Madhya 15.155]]
  : " 'Just to test your firm faith in your Lord, I requested you again and again to change your worship from Lord Rāmacandra to Kṛṣṇa.'

  ; [[.15:156|Cc. Madhya 15.156]]
  : "In this way, I congratulated Murāri Gupta, saying, 'Indeed, you are the incarnation of Hanumān. Consequently you are the eternal servant of Lord Rāmacandra. Why should you give up the worship of Lord Rāmacandra and His lotus feet?' "

  ; [[.15:157|Cc. Madhya 15.157]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "I accept this Murāri Gupta as My life and soul. When I hear of his humility, it perturbs My very life."

  ; [[.15:158|Cc. Madhya 15.158]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then embraced Vāsudeva Datta and began to speak of his glories as if He had a thousand mouths.

  ; [[.15:159|Cc. Madhya 15.159]]
  : When Caitanya Mahāprabhu glorified him, Vāsudeva Datta immediately became very embarrassed and shy. He then submitted himself, touching the Lord's lotus feet.

  ; [[.15:160|Cc. Madhya 15.160]]
  : Vāsudeva Datta told Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "My dear Lord, You incarnate just to deliver all conditioned souls. I have now one petition, which I wish You would accept.

  ; [[.15:161|Cc. Madhya 15.161]]
  : "My Lord, You are certainly capable of doing whatever You like, and You are indeed merciful. If You so desire, You can very easily do whatever You want.

  ; [[.15:162|Cc. Madhya 15.162]]
  : "My Lord, my heart breaks to see the sufferings of all conditioned souls; therefore I request You to transfer the karma of their sinful lives upon my head.

  ; [[.15:163|Cc. Madhya 15.163]]
  : "My dear Lord, let me suffer perpetually in a hellish condition, accepting all the sinful reactions of all living entities. Please finish their diseased material life."

  ; [[.15:164|Cc. Madhya 15.164]]
  : When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard Vāsudeva Datta's statement, His heart became very soft. Tears flowed from His eyes, and He began to tremble. In a faltering voice He spoke as follows.

  ; [[.15:165|Cc. Madhya 15.165]]
  : Accepting Vāsudeva Datta as a great devotee, the Lord said, "Such a statement is not at all astonishing because you are the incarnation of Prahlāda Mahārāja. It appears that Lord Kṛṣṇa has bestowed complete mercy upon you. There is no doubt about it.

  ; [[.15:166|Cc. Madhya 15.166]]
  : "Whatever a pure devotee wants from his master, Lord Kṛṣṇa doubtlessly grants because He has no duty other than to fulfill the desire of His devotee.

  ; [[.15:167|Cc. Madhya 15.167]]
  : "If you desire the deliverance of all living entities within the universe, then all of them can be delivered even without your undergoing the tribulations of sinful activity.

  ; [[.15:168|Cc. Madhya 15.168]]
  : "Kṛṣṇa is not incapable, for He has all potencies. Why would He induce you to suffer the sinful reactions of other living entities?

  ; [[.15:169|Cc. Madhya 15.169]]
  : "Whosever welfare you desire immediately becomes a Vaiṣṇava, and Kṛṣṇa delivers all Vaiṣṇavas from the reactions of their past sinful activities.

  ; [[.15:170|Cc. Madhya 15.170]]
  : " 'Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who regulates the sufferings and enjoyments of fruitive activity for everyone-from the heavenly King Indra down to the smallest insect [indra-gopa]. That very Personality of Godhead destroys the fruitive karma of one engaged in devotional service.'

  ; [[.15:171|Cc. Madhya 15.171]]
  : "Because of your honest desire, all living entities within the universe will be delivered, for Kṛṣṇa does not have to do anything to deliver all the living entities of the universe.

  ; [[.15:172|Cc. Madhya 15.172]]
  : "Just as there are millions of fruits on the uḍumbara tree, millions of universes float on the waters of the river Virajā.

  ; [[.15:173|Cc. Madhya 15.173]]
  : "The uḍumbara tree is filled with millions of fruits, and if one falls down and is destroyed, the tree does not even consider the loss.

  ; [[.15:174|Cc. Madhya 15.174]]
  : "In the same way, if one universe is vacated due to the living entities' having been liberated, that is a very little thing for Kṛṣṇa. He does not take it very seriously.

  ; [[.15:175|Cc. Madhya 15.175]]
  : "The entire spiritual world constitutes the unlimited opulence of Kṛṣṇa, and there are innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets there. The Causal Ocean is considered the surrounding waters of Vaikuṇṭhaloka.

  ; [[.15:176|Cc. Madhya 15.176]]
  : "Māyā and her unlimited material universes are situated in that Causal Ocean. Indeed, māyā appears to be floating like a pot filled with mustard seeds.

  ; [[.15:177|Cc. Madhya 15.177]]
  : "Of the millions of mustard seeds floating in that pot, if one seed is lost, the loss is not at all significant. Similarly, if one universe is lost, it is not significant to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:178|Cc. Madhya 15.178]]
  : "To say nothing of one universal mustard seed, even if all the universes and the material energy [māyā] are destroyed, Kṛṣṇa does not even consider the loss.

  ; [[.15:179|Cc. Madhya 15.179]]
  : "If a person possessing millions of wish-fulfilling cows loses one she-goat, he does not consider the loss. Kṛṣṇa owns all six opulences in full. If the entire material energy is destroyed, what does He lose?"

  ; [[.15:180|Cc. Madhya 15.180]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, " 'O my Lord, O unconquerable one, O master of all potencies, please exhibit Your internal potency to conquer the nescience of all moving and inert living entities. Due to nescience, they accept all kinds of faulty things, thus provoking a fearful situation. O Lord, please show Your glories! You can do this very easily, for Your internal potency is beyond the external potency, and You are the reservoir of all opulence. You are also the demonstrator of the material potency. You are also always engaged in Your pastimes in the spiritual world. You exhibit Your reserved internal potency and sometimes exhibit the external potency by glancing over it. Thus You manifest Your pastimes. The Vedas confirm Your two potencies and accept both types of pastimes due to them.' "

  ; [[.15:181|Cc. Madhya 15.181]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu described the good qualities of His devotees one after the other. He then embraced them and bade them farewell.

  ; [[.15:182|Cc. Madhya 15.182]]
  : Due to the impending separation from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the devotees began to cry. The Lord was also morose due to separation from the devotees.

  ; [[.15:183|Cc. Madhya 15.183]]
  : Gadādhara Paṇḍita remained with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he was given a place to live at Yameśvara.

  ; [[.15:184-185|Cc. Madhya 15.184-185]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained at Jagannātha Purī, Nīlācala, with Paramānanda Purī, Jagadānanda, Svarūpa Dāmodara, Dāmodara Paṇḍita, Govinda and Kāśīśvara. It was Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's daily business to see Lord Jagannātha in the morning.

  ; [[.15:186|Cc. Madhya 15.186]]
  : One day Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya came before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with folded hands and submitted a request.

  ; [[.15:187|Cc. Madhya 15.187]]
  : Since all the Vaiṣṇavas had returned to Bengal, there was a good chance that the Lord would accept an invitation.

  ; [[.15:188|Cc. Madhya 15.188]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Please accept my invitation for lunch for one month." The Lord replied, "That is not possible because it is against the religious principles of a sannyāsī."

  ; [[.15:189|Cc. Madhya 15.189]]
  : Sārvabhauma then said, "Please accept the invitation for twenty days," but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "It is not a religious principle of the renounced order."

  ; [[.15:190|Cc. Madhya 15.190]]
  : When Sārvabhauma requested Caitanya Mahāprabhu to accept lunch for fifteen days, the Lord said, "I shall accept lunch at your place for one day only."

  ; [[.15:191|Cc. Madhya 15.191]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then caught hold of the Lord's lotus feet and submissively begged, "Please accept lunch for at least ten days."

  ; [[.15:192|Cc. Madhya 15.192]]
  : In this way, by and by, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reduced the duration to five days. Thus for five days He regularly accepted the invitation to lunch.

  ; [[.15:193|Cc. Madhya 15.193]]
  : After this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "My Lord, there are ten sannyāsīs with You."

  ; [[.15:194|Cc. Madhya 15.194]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya then submitted that Paramānanda Purī Gosvāmī should accept a five-day invitation at his place. This was settled before the Lord.

  ; [[.15:195|Cc. Madhya 15.195]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Dāmodara Svarūpa is my intimate friend. He will come sometimes with You and sometimes alone.

  ; [[.15:196|Cc. Madhya 15.196]]
  : "The other eight sannyāsīs will accept invitations for two days each. In this way there will be engagements for each and every day during the entire month.

  ; [[.15:197|Cc. Madhya 15.197]]
  : "If all the sannyāsīs come together, it would not be possible for me to pay them proper respects. Therefore I would be an offender.

  ; [[.15:198|Cc. Madhya 15.198]]
  : "Sometimes You will come alone to my place, and sometimes You will be accompanied by Svarūpa Dāmodara."

  ; [[.15:199|Cc. Madhya 15.199]]
  : Having this arrangement confirmed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya became very glad and immediately invited the Lord to his house on that very day.

  ; [[.15:200|Cc. Madhya 15.200]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's wife was known as the mother of Ṣāṭhī. She was a great devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and she was affectionate like a mother.

  ; [[.15:201|Cc. Madhya 15.201]]
  : After returning to his home, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya gave orders to his wife, and his wife, known as Ṣāṭhīra Mātā, the mother of Ṣāṭhī, began cooking with great pleasure.

  ; [[.15:202|Cc. Madhya 15.202]]
  : At Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's house, there was always a full stock of food. Whatever spinach, vegetables, fruit and so on were required, he collected and brought back home.

  ; [[.15:203|Cc. Madhya 15.203]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya personally began to help his wife cook. His wife, the mother of Ṣāṭhī, was very experienced, and she knew how to cook nicely.

  ; [[.15:204|Cc. Madhya 15.204]]
  : On the southern side of the kitchen were two rooms for offering food, and in one of them the food was offered to Śālagrāma Nārāyaṇa.

  ; [[.15:205|Cc. Madhya 15.205]]
  : The other room was for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's lunch. The Lord's lunch room was very secluded, and it was newly constructed by Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.15:206|Cc. Madhya 15.206]]
  : The room was so constructed that there was only one door as an entrance from the outside for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There was another door attached to the kitchen, and it was through this door that the food was brought.

  ; [[.15:207|Cc. Madhya 15.207]]
  : First, three mānas of cooked rice-almost six pounds-was poured on a big banana leaf.

  ; [[.15:208|Cc. Madhya 15.208]]
  : Then, the whole stack of rice was mixed with so much yellowish and fragrant clarified butter that it began to overflow the leaf.

  ; [[.15:209|Cc. Madhya 15.209]]
  : There were a number of pots made of the bark of banana trees and the leaves of the keyā plant. These pots were filled with various cooked vegetables and placed on all sides of the leaf.

  ; [[.15:210|Cc. Madhya 15.210]]
  : There were about ten kinds of spinach, a soup called sukhta, which was made with bitter nimba leaves, a pungent preparation made with black pepper, a mild cake made of fried curd, and buttermilk mixed with small fried pieces of dhal.

  ; [[.15:211|Cc. Madhya 15.211]]
  : There were preparations of dugdha-tumbī, dugdha-kuṣmāṇḍa, vesara, lāphrā, mocā-ghaṇṭa, mocā-bhājā and other vegetables.

  ; [[.15:212|Cc. Madhya 15.212]]
  : There were unlimited quantities of vṛddha-kuṣmāṇḍa-baḍī, phula-baḍī, fruits and various roots.

  ; [[.15:213|Cc. Madhya 15.213]]
  : Other preparations included eggplant mixed with newly grown nimba leaves fried together, light baḍī, fried paṭola, and fried rounds of squash and pumpkin.

  ; [[.15:214|Cc. Madhya 15.214]]
  : There was a soup made with fried urad dhal and mung dhal, defeating nectar. There were also sweet chutney and five or six kinds of sour preparations, beginning with baḍāmla.

  ; [[.15:215|Cc. Madhya 15.215]]
  : There were bharats made of mung dhal, of urd dhal and of sweet bananas, and there was sweet rice cake, coconut cake and various other cakes.

  ; [[.15:216|Cc. Madhya 15.216]]
  : There was kāṅji-baḍā, dugdha-ciḍā, dugdha-laklakī and various cakes, which I am unable to describe.

  ; [[.15:217|Cc. Madhya 15.217]]
  : Sweet rice mixed with ghee was poured into an earthen pot and mixed with cāṅpā-kalā, condensed milk and mango.

  ; [[.15:218|Cc. Madhya 15.218]]
  : Other preparations included a very delicious churned curd and a variety of sandeśa sweetmeats. Indeed, all the various eatables available in Bengal and Orissa were prepared.

  ; [[.15:219|Cc. Madhya 15.219]]
  : Thus Bhaṭṭācārya prepared a great variety of food and spread a fine cloth over a white wooden platform.

  ; [[.15:220|Cc. Madhya 15.220]]
  : On two sides of the stack of food were pitchers filled with scented cold water. The flowers of the tulasī tree were placed above the mound of rice.

  ; [[.15:221|Cc. Madhya 15.221]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya also included several types of food that had been offered to Lord Jagannātha. This included sweetballs known as amṛta-guṭikā, sweet rice and cakes. All these were kept separately.

  ; [[.15:222|Cc. Madhya 15.222]]
  : When everything was ready, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came there alone after finishing His midday duties. He knew the heart of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.15:223|Cc. Madhya 15.223]]
  : After Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya washed the Lord's feet, the Lord entered the room to take His lunch.

  ; [[.15:224|Cc. Madhya 15.224]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a little astonished to see the gorgeous arrangement, and, gesturing, He spoke to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.15:225|Cc. Madhya 15.225]]
  : "This is most uncommon! How was this arrangement of rice and vegetables finished within six hours?

  ; [[.15:226|Cc. Madhya 15.226]]
  : "Even a hundred men cooking on a hundred ovens could not possibly finish all these preparations within so short a time.

  ; [[.15:227|Cc. Madhya 15.227]]
  : "I hope the food has already been offered to Kṛṣṇa, since I see there are tulasī flowers over the plates.

  ; [[.15:228|Cc. Madhya 15.228]]
  : "You are most fortunate, and your endeavor is successful, for you have offered such wonderful food to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:229|Cc. Madhya 15.229]]
  : "The color of the rice is so attractive and its aroma so good that it appears Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa have directly taken it.

  ; [[.15:230|Cc. Madhya 15.230]]
  : "My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, your fortune is very great. How much shall I praise you? I also am very fortunate to be able to take the remnants of this food.

  ; [[.15:231|Cc. Madhya 15.231]]
  : "Take away Kṛṣṇa's sitting place and put it aside. Then give me prasāda on a different plate."

  ; [[.15:232|Cc. Madhya 15.232]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "It is not so wonderful, my Lord. Everything has been made possible by the energy and mercy of He who will eat the food.

  ; [[.15:233|Cc. Madhya 15.233]]
  : "My wife and I did not especially exert ourselves in the cooking. He by whose power the food has been prepared knows everything.

  ; [[.15:234|Cc. Madhya 15.234]]
  : "Now please sit in this place and take Your lunch." Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "This place is worshipable because it was used by Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.15:235|Cc. Madhya 15.235]]
  : Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Both the food and the sitting place are the Lord's mercy. If You can eat the remnants of the food, what is the offense in Your sitting in this place?"

  ; [[.15:236|Cc. Madhya 15.236]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "Yes, you have spoken correctly. The śāstras enjoin that the devotee can partake of everything left by Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:237|Cc. Madhya 15.237]]
  : " 'My dear Lord, the garlands, scented substances, garments, ornaments and other such things that have been offered to You may later be used by Your servants. By partaking of these things and eating the remnants of food You have left, we will be able to conquer the illusory energy.' "

  ; [[.15:238|Cc. Madhya 15.238]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "There is so much food here that it is impossible to eat." Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "I know how much You can eat.

  ; [[.15:239|Cc. Madhya 15.239]]
  : "After all, at Jagannātha Purī You eat fifty-two times a day, and each time You eat hundreds of buckets filled with prasāda.

  ; [[.15:240|Cc. Madhya 15.240]]
  : "At Dvārakā, You keep sixteen thousand queens in sixteen thousand palaces. Also, there are eighteen mothers and numerous friends and relatives of the Yadu dynasty.

  ; [[.15:241|Cc. Madhya 15.241]]
  : "In Vṛndāvana You also have Your father's elder brothers, Your father's younger brothers, maternal uncles, husbands of Your father's sisters and many cowherd men. There are also cowherd boy friends, and You eat twice a day, morning and evening, in the house of each and every one.

  ; [[.15:242|Cc. Madhya 15.242]]
  : "Indeed," Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "at the Govardhana-pūjā ceremony You ate stacks of rice. In comparison to that, this small quantity is not even a morsel for You.

  ; [[.15:243|Cc. Madhya 15.243]]
  : "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas I am a most insignificant living being. Therefore You may accept a little quantity of food from my house."

  ; [[.15:244|Cc. Madhya 15.244]]
  : Hearing this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled and sat down to eat. Bhaṭṭācārya, with great pleasure, first offered Him the prasāda from the Jagannātha temple.

  ; [[.15:245|Cc. Madhya 15.245]]
  : At this time Bhaṭṭācārya had a son-in-law named Amogha, who was the husband of his daughter named Ṣāṭhī. Although born in an aristocratic brāhmaṇa family, this Amogha was a great faultfinder and blasphemer.

  ; [[.15:246|Cc. Madhya 15.246]]
  : Amogha wanted to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu eat, but he was not allowed to enter. Indeed, Bhaṭṭācārya guarded the threshold of his house with a stick in his hand.

  ; [[.15:247|Cc. Madhya 15.247]]
  : However, as soon as Bhaṭṭācārya began distributing prasāda and was a little inattentive, Amogha came in. Seeing the quantity of food, he began to blaspheme.

  ; [[.15:248|Cc. Madhya 15.248]]
  : "This much food is sufficient to satisfy ten or twelve men, but this sannyāsī alone is eating so much!"

  ; [[.15:249|Cc. Madhya 15.249]]
  : As soon as Amogha said this, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya turned his eyes upon him. Seeing Bhaṭṭācārya's attitude, Amogha immediately left.

  ; [[.15:250|Cc. Madhya 15.250]]
  : Bhaṭṭācārya ran after him to strike him with a stick, but Amogha fled so fast that Bhaṭṭācārya could not catch him.

  ; [[.15:251|Cc. Madhya 15.251]]
  : Bhaṭṭācārya then began to curse and call his son-in-law ill names. When Bhaṭṭācārya returned, he saw that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was laughing to hear him criticize Amogha.

  ; [[.15:252|Cc. Madhya 15.252]]
  : When Ṣāṭhī's mother, Bhaṭṭācārya's wife, heard of this incident, she immediately began to strike her head and chest, saying again, "Let Ṣāṭhī become a widow!"

  ; [[.15:253|Cc. Madhya 15.253]]
  : Seeing the lamentation of both husband and wife, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu tried to pacify them. According to their desire, He ate the prasāda and was very satisfied.

  ; [[.15:254|Cc. Madhya 15.254]]
  : After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu finished eating, Bhaṭṭācārya washed His mouth, hands and legs and offered Him flavored spices, tulasī-mañjarī, cloves, and cardamom.

  ; [[.15:255|Cc. Madhya 15.255]]
  : The Bhaṭṭācārya then placed a flower garland over Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and smeared His body with sandalwood pulp. After offering obeisances, the Bhaṭṭācārya submitted the following humble statement.

  ; [[.15:256|Cc. Madhya 15.256]]
  : "I brought You to my home just to have You blasphemed. This is a great offense. Please excuse me. I beg Your pardon."

  ; [[.15:257|Cc. Madhya 15.257]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "What Amogha has said is correct; therefore it is not blasphemy. What is your offense?"

  ; [[.15:258|Cc. Madhya 15.258]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left and returned to His residence. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya also followed Him.

  ; [[.15:259|Cc. Madhya 15.259]]
  : Falling down at the Lord's feet, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said many things in self-reproach. The Lord then pacified him and sent him back to his home.

  ; [[.15:260|Cc. Madhya 15.260]]
  : After returning to his home, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya consulted with his wife, the mother of Ṣāṭhī. After personally condemning himself, he began to speak as follows.

  ; [[.15:261|Cc. Madhya 15.261]]
  : "If the man who blasphemed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is killed, his sinful action may be atoned."

  ; [[.15:262|Cc. Madhya 15.262]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya continued, "Or, if I give up my own life, this sinful action may be atoned. However, neither of these ideas are befitting because both bodies belong to brāhmaṇas.

  ; [[.15:263|Cc. Madhya 15.263]]
  : "Instead, I shall never see the face of that blasphemer. I reject him and give up his relationship. I shall never even speak his name.

  ; [[.15:264|Cc. Madhya 15.264]]
  : "Inform my daughter Ṣāṭhī to abandon her relationship with her husband because he has fallen down. When the husband falls down, it is the wife's duty to relinquish the relationship.

  ; [[.15:265|Cc. Madhya 15.265]]
  : "When a husband is fallen, his relationship must be given up."

  ; [[.15:266|Cc. Madhya 15.266]]
  : That night Amogha, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's son-in-law, fled, and in the morning he immediately fell sick with cholera.

  ; [[.15:267|Cc. Madhya 15.267]]
  : When Bhaṭṭācārya heard that Amogha was dying of cholera, he thought, "It is the favor of Providence that He is doing what I want to do.

  ; [[.15:268|Cc. Madhya 15.268]]
  : "When one offends the Supreme Personality of Godhead, karma immediately takes effect." After saying this, he recited two verses from revealed scripture.

  ; [[.15:269|Cc. Madhya 15.269]]
  : " 'What we have had to arrange with great endeavor by collecting elephants, horses, chariots and infantry soldiers has already been accomplished by the Gandharvas.'

  ; [[.15:270|Cc. Madhya 15.270]]
  : " 'When a person mistreats great souls, his life span, opulence, reputation, religion, possessions and good fortune are all destroyed.'

  ; [[.15:271|Cc. Madhya 15.271]]
  : At this time, Gopīnātha Ācārya went to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Lord asked him about the events taking place in Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's house.

  ; [[.15:272|Cc. Madhya 15.272]]
  : Gopīnātha Ācārya informed the Lord that both the husband and wife were fasting and that their son-in-law Amogha was dying of cholera.

  ; [[.15:273|Cc. Madhya 15.273]]
  : As soon as Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard that Amogha was going to die, He immediately ran to him in great haste. Placing His hand on Amogha's chest, He spoke as follows.

  ; [[.15:274|Cc. Madhya 15.274]]
  : "The heart of a brāhmaṇa is by nature very clean; therefore it is a proper place for Kṛṣṇa to sit.

  ; [[.15:275|Cc. Madhya 15.275]]
  : "Why have you allowed jealousy to sit here also? Because of this, you have become like a caṇḍāla, the lowest of men, and you have also contaminated a most purified place-your heart.

  ; [[.15:276|Cc. Madhya 15.276]]
  : "However, due to the association of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, all your contamination is now vanquished. When a person's heart is cleansed of all contamination, he is able to chant the mahā-mantra, Hare Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:277|Cc. Madhya 15.277]]
  : "Therefore, Amogha, get up and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra! If you do so, Kṛṣṇa will unfailingly bestow mercy upon you."

  ; [[.15:278|Cc. Madhya 15.278]]
  : After hearing Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and being touched by Him, Amogha, who was on his deathbed, immediately stood up and began to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Thus he became mad with ecstatic love and began to dance emotionally.

  ; [[.15:279|Cc. Madhya 15.279]]
  : While Amogha danced in ecstatic love, he manifested all the ecstatic symptoms-trembling, tears, jubilation, trance, perspiration and a faltering voice. Seeing these waves of ecstatic emotion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu began to laugh.

  ; [[.15:280|Cc. Madhya 15.280]]
  : Amogha then fell before the Lord's lotus feet and submissively said, "O merciful Lord, please excuse my offense."

  ; [[.15:281|Cc. Madhya 15.281]]
  : Not only did Amogha beg the Lord's pardon, but he also began slapping his own cheeks, saying, "By this mouth I have blasphemed You."

  ; [[.15:282|Cc. Madhya 15.282]]
  : Indeed, Amogha continued slapping his face over and over until his cheeks were swollen. Finally Gopīnātha Ācārya stopped him by catching hold of his hands.

  ; [[.15:283|Cc. Madhya 15.283]]
  : After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pacified Amogha by touching his body and saying, "You are the object of My affection because you are the son-in-law of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya.

  ; [[.15:284|Cc. Madhya 15.284]]
  : "Everyone in Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's house is very dear to Me, including his maids and servants and even his dog. And what to speak of his relatives?

  ; [[.15:285|Cc. Madhya 15.285]]
  : "Amogha, always chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and do not commit any further offenses." After giving Amogha this instruction, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to Sārvabhauma's house."

  ; [[.15:286|Cc. Madhya 15.286]]
  : Upon seeing the Lord, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya immediately caught hold of His lotus feet. The Lord also embraced him and sat down.

  ; [[.15:287|Cc. Madhya 15.287]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu pacified Sārvabhauma, saying, "After all, Amogha, your son-in-law, is a child. So what is his fault? Why are you fasting, and why are you angry?

  ; [[.15:288|Cc. Madhya 15.288]]
  : "Just get up and take your bath and go see the face of Lord Jagannātha. Then return here to eat your lunch. In this way I shall be happy.

  ; [[.15:289|Cc. Madhya 15.289]]
  : "I shall stay here until you return to take Lord Jagannātha's remnants for your lunch."

  ; [[.15:290|Cc. Madhya 15.290]]
  : Catching hold of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's lotus feet, Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Why did You bring Amogha back to life? It would have been better had he died."

  ; [[.15:291|Cc. Madhya 15.291]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Amogha is a child and your son. The father does not take the faults of his son seriously, especially when he is maintaining him.

  ; [[.15:292|Cc. Madhya 15.292]]
  : "Now that he has become a Vaiṣṇava, he is offenseless. You can bestow your mercy upon him without hesitation."

  ; [[.15:293|Cc. Madhya 15.293]]
  : Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, " Please go, my Lord, to see Lord Jagannātha. After taking my bath, I shall go there and then return."

  ; [[.15:294|Cc. Madhya 15.294]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then told Gopīnātha, "Stay here and inform Me when Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has taken his prasāda."

  ; [[.15:295|Cc. Madhya 15.295]]
  : After saying this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to see Lord Jagannātha. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya completed his bath, went to see Lord Jagannātha and then returned to his house to accept food.

  ; [[.15:296|Cc. Madhya 15.296]]
  : Thereafter, Amogha became an unalloyed devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He danced in ecstasy and peacefully chanted the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.15:297|Cc. Madhya 15.297]]
  : In this way, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu performed His various pastimes. Whoever sees them or hears of them becomes truly astonished.

  ; [[.15:298|Cc. Madhya 15.298]]
  : Thus Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enjoyed eating in Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's house. Within that one pastime, many wonderful pastimes were manifest.

  ; [[.15:299|Cc. Madhya 15.299]]
  : These are the peculiar characteristics of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastimes. Thus the Lord ate in Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's house, and in this way Sārvabhauma's love for the Lord has become very well known.

  ; [[.15:300|Cc. Madhya 15.300]]
  : Thus I have related the ecstatic love of Sārvabhauma's wife, who is known as the mother of Ṣāṭhī. I have also related Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's great mercy, which He manifested by excusing Amogha's offense. He did so due to Amogha's relationship with a devotee.

  ; [[.15:301|Cc. Madhya 15.301]]
  : Whoever hears these pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with faith and love will attain the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet very soon.

  ; [[.15:302|Cc. Madhya 15.302]]
  : Praying at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Raghunātha, always desiring their mercy, I, Kṛṣṇadāsa, narrate Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, following in their footsteps.
