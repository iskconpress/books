In the //Taittirīya Upaniṣad// (3.1) it is said, //yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante:// "The entire material cosmic manifestation is born of the Supreme Brahman." Also, the //Brahma-sūtra// begins with the verse //janmādy asya yataḥ:// "The Absolute Truth is that from whom everything emanates." (//Brahma-sūtra// 1.1.2) That Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]], Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me." Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the original Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Again, Kṛṣṇa states in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]], //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:// "By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded." And as confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.37), //goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ:// "Although the Lord always stays in His abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, He is still all-pervading." His all-pervasive feature is understood to be impersonal because one does not find the form of the Lord in that all-pervasiveness. Actually, everything is resting on the rays of His bodily effulgence. The //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.40) also states:

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam

"Due to the rays of the Lord's bodily effulgence, millions of universes are created, just as planets are created from the sun."
