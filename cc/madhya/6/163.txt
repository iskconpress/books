===== Purport =====

The //Brahma-sūtra// states that according to the principle of //śakti-śaktimatayor abhedaḥ,// the living entity is simultaneously one with and different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Qualitatively the living entity and the Supreme Lord are one, but in quantity they are different. According to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy (//acintya-bhedābheda-tattva//), the living entity and the Supreme Lord are accepted as one and different at the same time.
