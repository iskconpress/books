The //Vedānta-// or //Brahma-sūtra,// written by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, is a book studied by all advanced spiritual students, especially by the //sannyāsīs// of all religious communities (//sampradāyas//). The //sannyāsīs// must read the //Vedānta-sūtra// to establish their final conclusions concerning Vedic knowledge. Here, of course, the //Vedānta// mentioned is the commentary of Śaṅkarācārya, known as //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya intended to convert Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī,// into a Māyāvādī //sannyāsī.// He therefore made this arrangement to instruct Him in the //Vedānta-sūtra// according to the //Śārīraka// commentary of Śaṅkarācārya. All the //sannyāsīs// of the Śaṅkara-sampradāya enjoy seriously studying the //Vedānta-sūtra// with the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// commentary. It is said, //vedānta-vākyeṣu sadā ramantaḥ:// "One should always enjoy the studies of the //Vedānta-sūtra.//"
