This verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.8.13) was spoken by Garga Muni when he was performing the rituals at Lord Kṛṣṇa's name-giving ceremony. He states that the incarnations of the Lord in other ages had been white, red and yellow. This yellow color refers to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whose bodily complexion was yellowish. This confirms that in the past Kali-yugas, the Lord also had incarnated in a body that was yellow in hue. It is understood that the Lord incarnates in different colors for the different //yugas// (Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali). Accepting the color yellow (//pīta//), as well as other characteristics, the Lord incarnated as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is the verdict of all Vedic authorities.
