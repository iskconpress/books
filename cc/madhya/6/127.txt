===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented Himself as if He were a //sannyāsī// in name only or, in other words, a number-one fool. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// in India are very accustomed to declaring themselves //jagad-gurus,// teachers of the world, although they have no information of the outside world and are limited in their experience to a small town or village, or perhaps to the country of India. Nor do such //sannyāsīs// have sufficient education. Unfortunately, at the present moment there are many foolish //sannyāsīs,// both in India and elsewhere, who simply read and study Vedic literature without understanding the purports. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was having His discussion with the Chand Kazi, the Muslim magistrate of Navadvīpa, He recited a verse from Vedic literature to the effect that the order of //sannyāsa// is prohibited in this Age of Kali. Only those who are very serious and who follow the regulative principles and study Vedic literature should accept //sannyāsa.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu approved of a //sannyāsī's// reading the //Vedānta-sūtra,// or //Brahma-sūtra,// but He did not approve the //Śārīraka// commentary of Śaṅkarācārya. Indeed, He said elsewhere, //māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa:// "If one hears the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya// of Śaṅkarācārya, he is doomed." Thus a //sannyāsī,// a transcendentalist, must read the //Vedānta-sūtra// regularly, but he should not read the //Śārīraka-bhāṣya.// This is the conclusion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The real commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra// is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Artho 'yaṁ brahma-sūtrānām:Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the original commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra// written by the author himself, Śrīla Vyāsadeva.
