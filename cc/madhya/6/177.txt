===== Purport =====

The word //vitaṇḍā// indicates that a debater, not touching the main point or establishing his own point, simply tries to refute the other person's argument. When one does not touch the direct meaning but tries to divert attention by misinterpretation, he engages in //chala.// The word //nigraha// also means always trying to refute the arguments of the other party.
