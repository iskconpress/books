The word //pūrvāśrama// refers to one's previous situation in life. Sometimes a person will accept the renounced order from householder life, and sometimes even from student (//brahmacārī//) life. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to know of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's previous situation as a householder.
