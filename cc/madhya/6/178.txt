The //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]] also confirms this statement: //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ.// The actual purpose in reading the //Vedas// is to learn how to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. The Lord Himself advises, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:9:34|(Bg. 9.34)]]. Therefore, after studying the //Vedas,// one must then execute devotional service by thinking always of the Supreme Lord (//man-manā//), becoming His devotee, worshiping Him and always offering Him obeisances. This is called //viṣṇu-ārādhana,// and it is the supreme occupational duty of all human beings. It is properly discharged in the //varṇāśrama-dharma// system, which divides society into //brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa,// and //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra.// This is the whole scheme of Vedic civilization. However, this institution is very difficult to establish in this age; therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises that we not worry about the Vedic system of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Rather, we should take directly to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and simply hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from pure devotees. This is the process recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this is the purpose for studying the //Vedas.//
