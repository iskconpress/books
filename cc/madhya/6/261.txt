When reading this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.14.8), Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya changed the original reading from //mukti-pade// to //bhakti-pade. Mukti// means liberation and merging into the impersonal Brahman effulgence. //Bhakti// means rendering transcendental service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of having developed pure devotional service, the Bhaṭṭācārya did not like the word //mukti-pade,// which refers to the impersonal Brahman feature of the Lord. However, he was not authorized to change a word in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will explain. Although the Bhaṭṭācārya changed the word in his devotional ecstasy, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not approve of it.
