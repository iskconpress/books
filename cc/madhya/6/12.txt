The word //sūddīpta-sāttvika// is explained as follows by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura: "The //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// mentions eight kinds of transcendental transformations in the bodies of advanced devotees. These are sometimes checked by the devotee, and there are two stages of such checking, technically known as //dhūmāyitā// and //jvalitā.// The //dhūmāyitā// (smoking) stage is exhibited when only one or two transformations are slightly present and it is possible to conceal them. When more than two or three transcendental transformations are manifest and it is still possible to conceal them, although with great difficulty, that stage is called //jvalitā// (lighted). When four or five symptoms are exhibited, the //dīpta// (blazing) stage has been reached. When five, six or all eight symptoms are simultaneously manifest, that position is called //uddīpta// (inflamed). And when all eight symptoms are multiplied a thousand times and are all visible at once, the devotee is in the //sūddīpta// (intensely inflamed) stage. //Nitya-siddha-bhakta// indicates the eternally liberated associates of the Lord. Such devotees enjoy the company of the Lord in four relationships-as servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover."
