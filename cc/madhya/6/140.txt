===== Purport =====

Brahman means //bṛhattva,// the greatest of all. The greatest of all is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He possesses all potencies and opulence in full; therefore the Absolute Truth, the greatest of all, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whether one says "Brahman" or "the Supreme Personality of Godhead," the fact is the same, for they are identical. In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma.// Although the living entities or material nature are sometimes described as Brahman, Paraṁ Brahma---the Supreme, the greatest of all Brahmans-is still Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is full with all opulences, and as such He possesses all riches, all strength, all reputation, all knowledge, all beauty and all renunciation. He is eternally a person and eternally supreme. If one tries to explain the Supreme impersonally, one distorts the real meaning of Brahman.
