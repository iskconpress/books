===== Purport =====

Because the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// teach Vedānta philosophy to their students or disciples, they are customarily called //jagad-guru.// This indicates that they are the benefactors of all people. Although Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was not a //sannyāsī// but a householder, he used to invite all the //sannyāsīs// to his home and offer them //prasāda.// Thus he was accepted as the best well-wisher and friend of all the //sannyāsīs.//
