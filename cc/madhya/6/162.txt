===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature the master of all potencies. By nature, the living entities, being infinitesimal, are always under the influence of the Lord's potencies. According to the //Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// (3.1.1-2):

> dvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā
> samānaṁ vṛkṣaṁ pariṣasvajāte
> tayor anyaḥ pippalaṁ svādv atty
> anaśnann anyo 'bhicākaśīti
>
> samāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno
> 'nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ
> juṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam
> asya mahimānam eti vīta-śokaḥ

The //Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// completely distinguishes the Lord from the living entities. The living entity is subjected to the reactions of fruitive activity, whereas the Lord simply witnesses such activity and bestows the results. According to the living entity's desires, he is wandering from one body to another and from one planet to another, under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā. However, when the living entity comes to his senses by the mercy of the Lord, he is awarded devotional service. Thus he is saved from the clutches of //māyā.// At such a time he can see his eternal friend, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and become free from all lamentation and hankering. This is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]], where the Lord says, //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati:// "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything." Thus it is definitely proved that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of all potencies and that the living entities are always subjected to these potencies. That is the difference between //māyādhīśa// and //māyā-vaśa.//
