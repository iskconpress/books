**Offering his obeisances to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya said, "Namo nārāyaṇāya" ["I offer my obeisances to Nārāyaṇa"]." In return, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Kṛṣṇe matir astu" ["Let your attention be on Kṛṣṇa"]."**

===== Purport =====

It is the etiquette among //sannyāsīs,// those on the fourth platform of spiritual life, to offer respects by saying //oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya// ("I offer my respectful obeisances unto Nārāyaṇa"). This greeting is used especially by Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs.// According to the //smṛti// scriptures, a //sannyāsī// should not expect anything from anyone, nor should he consider himself identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// never think of themselves as being one with the Lord; they always consider themselves eternal servants of Kṛṣṇa, and they want to see everyone in the world become Kṛṣṇa conscious. For this reason, a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// always offers his blessings to everyone, saying //kṛṣṇe matir astu// ("May you become Kṛṣṇa conscious").
