Tat tvam asi is accepted as the primary vibration by one who does not accept //praṇava,// the transcendental sound incarnation of the holy name of the Lord, as the chief principle in Vedic literature. By word jugglery, Śaṅkarācārya tried to create an illusory presentation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His relationship with the living entities and the cosmic manifestation. //Tat tvam asi// is a warning to the living entity not to mistake the body for the self. Therefore //tat tvam asi// is especially meant for the conditioned soul. The chanting of //oṁkāra// or the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is meant for the liberated soul. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said, //ayi mukta-kulair upāsyamānam// (//Nāmāṣṭaka// 1). Thus the holy name of the Lord is chanted by the liberated souls. Similarly, Parīkṣit Mahārāja says, //nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānāt// [[books:sb:10.1.4|(Bhāg. 10.1.4)]]. The holy name of the Lord can be chanted by those who have fully satisfied their material desires or who are fully situated on the transcendental platform and devoid of material desire. The name of the Lord can be chanted by one who is completely freed from material contamination (//anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam//). Śaṅkarācārya has indirectly minimized the value of the principal Vedic //mantra// (//oṁkāra//) by accepting a subordinate vibration (//tat tvam asi//) as the most important Vedic //mantra.//
