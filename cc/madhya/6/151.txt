As mentioned above, the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// (3.19) states:

> apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā
> paśyaty acakṣuḥ sa śṛṇoty akarṇaḥ
> sa vetti vedyaṁ na ca tasyāsti vettā
> tam āhur agryaṁ puruṣaṁ mahāntam

This Vedic //mantra// clearly states, //puruṣaṁ mahāntam.// The word //puruṣa// means "person." That person is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// by Arjuna when he addresses Kṛṣṇa, //puruṣaṁ śāśvatam:// "You are the original person." [[books:bg:10:12-13|(Bg. 10.12)]] This //puruṣaṁ mahāntam// is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. His hands and legs are not mundane, but are completely transcendental. However, when He comes, fools take Him to be an ordinary person (//avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam//). One who has no Vedic knowledge, who has not studied the //Vedas// from a bona fide spiritual master, does not know Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he is a //mūḍha.// Such fools take Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary person (//paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ//). They do not actually know what Kṛṣṇa is. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.// It is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa simply by studying the //Vedas// perfectly. One must have the mercy of a devotee (//yat-pādam//). Unless one is favored by a devotee, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna confirms this in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:14|(Bg. 10.14)]]: "My Lord, it is very difficult to understand Your personality." The less intelligent class of men cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead without being favored by His devotee. Therefore the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]] contains another injunction:

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ

One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to him. Only then can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a person.
