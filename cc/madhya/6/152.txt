**"Are you describing as formless that Supreme Personality of Godhead whose transcendental form is complete with six transcendental opulences?**

===== Purport =====

If the Supreme Personality of Godhead is formless, how can He be said to walk very fast and accept everything offered to Him? Rejecting the direct meaning of the Vedic //mantras,// the Māyāvādī philosophers interpret them and try to establish the Absolute Truth as formless. Actually, the Supreme Lord has an eternal personal form full of all opulence. The Māyāvādī philosophers try to interpret the Absolute Truth as being without potency. However, in the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// (6.8) it is clearly said, //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate:// "The Absolute Truth has multipotencies."
