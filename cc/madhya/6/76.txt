===== Purport =====

The Bhaṭṭācārya wanted to reinstate Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu into the Sarasvatī //sampradāya// because he did not like the Lord's belonging to the Bhāratī //sampradāya// or Purī //sampradāya.// Actually, he did not know the position of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not depend on an inferior or superior //sampradāya.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead remains in the supreme position in all circumstances.
