===== Purport =====

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya considered Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu a very humble and meek person because although Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a //sannyāsī,// He still retained His //brahmacārī// name. The Lord took //sannyāsa// from Keśava Bhāratī in the Bhāratī //sampradāya,// in which the //brahmacārīs// (the assistants of the //sannyāsīs//) are named "Caitanya." Even after accepting //sannyāsa,// Caitanya Mahāprabhu retained the name "Caitanya," meaning a humble servant of a //sannyāsī.// Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya appreciated this very much.
