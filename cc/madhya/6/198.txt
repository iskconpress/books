===== Purport =====

That Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive is verified by the activities of the four //ṛṣis// and Śukadeva Gosvāmī. All of them were liberated persons, yet they were attracted by the qualities and pastimes of the Lord. It is therefore said: //muktā api līlayā vigrahaṁ kṛtvā bhagavantaṁ bhajante.// [[books:cc:madhya:24:112|(Cc. Madhya 24.112)]] Even liberated persons are attracted by the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus engage in devotional service. From the very beginning of their lives, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four Kumāras, known as //catuḥ-sana,// were liberated and self-realized on the Brahman platform. Nonetheless, they were attracted by the qualities of Kṛṣṇa, and they engaged in His service. The four Kumāras were attracted by the aroma of the flowers offered at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and in this way they became devotees. Śukadeva Gosvāmī heard //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by the mercy of his father, Vyāsadeva, and he was consequently attracted to Kṛṣṇa and became a great devotee. The conclusion is that the transcendental bliss experienced in the service of the Lord must be superior to //brahmānanda,// the bliss derived from realizing the impersonal Brahman.
