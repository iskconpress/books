Adhirūḍha-bhāva, or //adhirūḍha-mahābhāva,// is explained in the //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,// by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes Rūpa Gosvāmī as follows: "The loving propensity of the //āśraya// (devotee) toward the //viṣaya// (Lord) becomes so ecstatic that even after enjoying the company of the beloved the devotee feels that his enjoyment is insufficient. At such a time, the lover sees the beloved in different ways. Such a development of ecstasy is called //anurāga.// When //anurāga// reaches its highest limit and becomes perceivable in the body, it is called //bhāva.// When the bodily symptoms are not very distinct, however, the emotional state is still called //anurāga,// not //bhāva.// When //bhāva// ecstasy is intensified, it is called //mahā-bhāva.// The symptoms of //mahā-bhāva// are visible only in the bodies of eternal associates like the //gopīs.//"
