Sālokya means that after material liberation one is promoted to the planet where the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. //Sāmīpya// means remaining an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Sārūpya// means attaining a four-handed form exactly like that of the Lord. //Sārṣṭi// means attaining opulences like those of the Supreme Lord, and //sāyujya// means merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Lord. These are the five types of liberation.
