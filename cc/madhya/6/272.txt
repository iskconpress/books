Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is also known as Mukunda, or He who gives transcendental bliss by offering all kinds of //mukti. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is divided into twelve cantos, and in the Ninth Canto different kinds of //mukti// are described. But the Tenth Canto is the actual center of all discussions of //mukti// because the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the tenth subject discussed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// is the exclusive subject of the Tenth Canto. Since all types of //muktis// reside at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He may be called //mukti-pada.//
