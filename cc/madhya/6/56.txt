===== Purport =====

A //sannyāsī// is always to be worshiped and offered all kinds of respect by the //gṛhasthas// (householders). Although Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was older than Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sārvabhauma respected Him as a //sannyāsī// and as one who had attained the topmost platform of spiritual ecstasy. Thus the Bhaṭṭācārya certainly accepted Him as his master.
