The //ātmārāma// verse was discussed at Naimiṣāraṇya at a meeting of many great sages, headed by Śaunaka Ṛṣi. They questioned Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī, who presided at the meeting, about why Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, a //paramahaṁsa// already in the transcendental position, was attracted to a discussion of the qualities of Kṛṣṇa. In other words, they wanted to know why Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī engaged in the study of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//
