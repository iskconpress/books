The nine types of devotional service are mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:5:23|(7.5.23)]]:

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
>
> iti puṁsārpitā viṣṇau
> bhaktiś cen nava-lakṣaṇā
> kriyeta bhagavaty addhā
> tan manye 'dhītam uttamam

These are the activities of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. As far as chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is concerned, one can be freed from all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name without committing offenses. If one chants offenselessly, he may be saved from all sinful reactions. It is very important in devotional service to chant the holy name of the Lord without committing offenses. The nine devotional processes such as //śravaṇa// and //kīrtana// can all be attained at once if one simply chants the holy name of the Lord offenselessly.

In this regard, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states in his book //Bhakti-sandarbha// (173): //yadyapi anyā bhaktiḥ kalau kartavyā, tada kīrtanākhya-bhakti-saṁyogenaiva.// Out of the nine processes of devotional service, //kīrtana// is very important. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī therefore instructs that the other processes, such as //arcana, vandana, dāsya// and //sakhya,// should be executed, but they must be preceded and followed by //kīrtana,// the chanting of the holy name. We have therefore introduced this system in all of our centers. //Arcana, ārati, bhoga// offering, Deity dressing and decoration are all preceded and followed by the chanting of the holy name of the Lord-Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
