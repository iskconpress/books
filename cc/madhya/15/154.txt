===== Purport =====

The word //prabhu,// or master, indicates that the Lord is to be continuously served by His devotee. The original //prabhu// is the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Nonetheless, there are many devotees attached to Lord Rāmacandra, and Murāri Gupta is a vivid example of such unalloyed devotion. He never agreed to give up Lord Rāmacandra's worship, not even upon Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's request. Such is the chastity of devotional service, as stated in the //Antya-līlā// of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:antya:4:46|(4.46-47)]]:

> sei bhakta dhanya, ye nā chāḍe prabhura caraṇa
> sei prabhu dhanya, ye nā chāḍe nija-jana
>
> durdaive sevaka yadi yāya anya sthāne
> sei ṭhākura dhanya tāre cule dhari' āne

In a firm relationship with the Lord, the devotee does not give up the Lord's service under any circumstance. As far as the Lord Himself is concerned, if the devotee chooses to leave, the Lord brings him back again, dragging him by the hair.
