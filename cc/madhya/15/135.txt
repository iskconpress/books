The //Vedas// enjoin, //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:// everything is the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman or Paraṁ Brahman. //Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat:// everything is a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Brahman. Since the energy and energetic are identical, actually everything is Kṛṣṇa, Paraṁ Brahman. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]] confirms this:

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ

"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them."

Kṛṣṇa is spread throughout the whole universe in His impersonal form. Since everything is a manifestation of the Lord's energy, the Lord can manifest Himself through any energy. In this age, the Lord is manifest through wood as Lord Jagannātha, and He is manifest through water as the River Ganges. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered the two brothers-Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and Vidyā-vācaspati-to worship Lord Jagannātha and the River Ganges.
