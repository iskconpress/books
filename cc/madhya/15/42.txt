===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus ordered Nityānanda Prabhu to deliver all the Bengalis to devotional service. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(Bg. 9.32)]] it is said:

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim

"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth-women, //vaiśyas// [merchants], as well as //śūdras// [workers]---can approach the supreme destination." Whoever takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and follows the regulative principles can return home, back to Godhead.

In his //Anubhāṣya,// Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura writes: "There is a class of so-called devotees called //prākṛta-sahajiyās// who think that Nityānanda Prabhu is an ordinary human being. They have spread the news that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Nityānanda Prabhu to return to Bengal from Orissa just to marry and beget children. This is certainly a great offense against Nityānanda Prabhu."

Such an offense is called //pāṣaṇḍa-buddhi,// or an atheistic remark. Offenders consider Nityānanda Prabhu to be like one of them, an ordinary human being. They do not know of Nityānanda Prabhu's identity with the //viṣṇu-tattva.// Thinking Nityānanda Prabhu to be an ordinary human being is the business of mental speculators known as //kuṇapātma-vādīs.// These people accept the material body, which is a bag of three material elements (//kuṇape tri-dhātuke//), as themselves. They think that Nityānanda Prabhu's body was similarly material and that it was meant for sense gratification. Whoever thinks in this way is a candidate for the darkest regions of hell. Those who hanker after women and money, who are self-interested and have the mentality of merchants, can certainly discover many things with their fertile brains and speak against the authorized revealed scriptures. They also engage in some moneymaking businesses to cheat innocent people, and they try to support their business programs by making such offensive statements. Actually Nityānanda Prabhu, being the expansion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is the most munificent incarnation. No one should consider Him an ordinary human being or an entity like the //prajāpatis,// who were ordered by Brahmā to increase generation. Nityānanda Prabhu should not be considered instrumental for sense gratification. Although professional so-called preachers support this, such statements are not found in any authorized revealed scriptures. Actually there is no support for these statements made by //sahajiyās// or other professional distributors of //kṛṣṇa-bhakti.//
