**With great respect, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu requested Advaita Ācārya, "Give Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotion to Kṛṣṇa, even to the lowest of men [caṇḍālas]."**

===== Purport =====

This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order to all His devotees. //Kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// devotion to Kṛṣṇa, is open to everyone, even low-class men like //caṇḍālas.// One should follow this order in the disciplic succession stemming from Śrī Advaita and Nityānanda Prabhu and distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness without discrimination throughout the world.

There are different kinds of men, beginning with the //brāhmaṇa// and going down to the lowest platform known as //caṇḍāla.// Whatever one's position, everyone in this Age of Kali needs to be enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the greatest need of the day. Everyone is acutely feeling the pangs of material existence. Even in the ranks and files of the American Senate, the pinpricks of material existence are felt, so much so that April 30, 1974, was actually set aside as Prayer Day. Thus everyone is feeling the resultant pinpricks of Kali-yuga brought about by human society's indulging in illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Now is the time for the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness to distribute //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// all over the world and thus follow the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Lord has ordered everyone to become a //guru// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|(Cc. Madhya 7.128)]]: //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa.// Everyone in every town and village should be enlightened by the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be distributed to everyone indiscriminately. In this way, the entire world will be peaceful and happy, and everyone will glorify Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as He desires.

The word //caṇḍāla// actually refers to a dog-eater, who is considered the lowest of men. Even //caṇḍālas// can be enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness due to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's benedictions. //Kṛṣṇa-bhakti// is not the monopoly of a certain caste. Everyone is eligible to receive this great benediction given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone should be given a chance to receive it and be happy.

The word //dāna,// meaning "charity," is also significant in this verse. Whoever engages in the distribution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a charitable person. Professional men recite //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and discuss //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// for an exchange of money. They cannot distribute such exalted transcendental property to everyone and anyone. Only pure devotees who have no motive other than serving Kṛṣṇa can give such transcendentally valuable benedictions out of charity.
