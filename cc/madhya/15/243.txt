===== Purport =====

A //sannyāsī// is expected to collect a little food from each and every householder. That is to say, he should take whatever he requires to eat. This system is called //mādhukarī.// The word //mādhukarī// comes from the word //mādhukara// and means "honey-collecting bees." Bees collect a little honey from each flower, but all these small quantities of honey accumulate to become a beehive. //Sannyāsīs// should collect a little from each and every householder and should eat simply what is necessary to maintain the body. Being a //sannyāsī,// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could collect a little food from the house of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, and this was the Bhaṭṭācārya's request. Compared to the food eaten by the Lord on other occasions, Bhaṭṭācārya's feast was not even a morsel. This is what Bhaṭṭācārya is pointing out to the Lord.
