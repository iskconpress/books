Among the followers of the Vedic way, //śālagrāma-śilā,// the //vigraha// of Nārāyaṇa, is worshiped in the form of a stone ball. In India, every //brāhmaṇa// still worships the //śālagrāma-śilā// in his home. The //vaiśyas// and //kṣatriyas// may also engage in this worship, but it is compulsory in the house of a //brāhmaṇa.//
