This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.6.46). In the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// the dancing in ecstasy and the eating of the remnants of food offered to the Lord are very, very important. One may be illiterate or incapable of understanding the philosophy, but if he partakes of these three items, he will certainly be liberated without delay.

This verse was spoken by Uddhava to Lord Kṛṣṇa. This was during the time when the //Uddhava-gītā// was spoken. At that time there was some disturbance in Dvārakā, and Lord Kṛṣṇa had to leave the material world and enter the spiritual world. Uddhava could understand the situation, and he talked with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The verse quoted above is an excerpt from their conversations. Śrī Kṛṣṇa's pastimes in this material world are called //prakaṭa-līlā// (manifested pastimes), and His pastimes in the spiritual world are called //aprakaṭa-līlā// (unmanifested pastimes). By unmanifested we mean that they are not present before our eyes. It is not that Lord Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are unmanifest. They are going on exactly as the sun is going on perpetually, but when the sun is present before our eyes, we call it daytime (manifest), and when it is not present, we call it night (unmanifest). Those who are above the jurisdiction of night are always in the spiritual world, where the Lord's pastimes are constantly manifest to them. As the //Brahma-saṁhitā// confirms:

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
>
> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who resides in His own realm, Goloka, with Rādhā, who resembles His own spiritual figure and who embodies the ecstatic potency [//hlādinī//]. Their companions are Her confidantes, who embody extensions of Her bodily form and who are imbued and permeated with everblissful spiritual //rasa.// I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa Himself with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love." (Bs. 5.37-38)
