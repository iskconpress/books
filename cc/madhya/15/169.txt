Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu here informed Vāsudeva Datta that since Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful, He can immediately deliver all conditioned souls from material existence. In essence, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "You desire the liberation of all kinds of living entities without discrimination. You are very anxious for their good fortune, and I say that simply by your prayer all living entities within the universe can be liberated. You do not even have to take up the burden of their sinful activities. Thus there is no need for you to suffer for their sinful lives. Whoever receives your compassion becomes a Vaiṣṇava immediately, and Kṛṣṇa delivers all Vaiṣṇavas from the reactions to their past sinful activities." This is also promised in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]:

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ

"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear."

As soon as one fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he becomes a Vaiṣṇava. In this verse from //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa promises to relieve His devotee from all the reactions to sinful life. It is a fact that a fully surrendered Vaiṣṇava is completely out of the range of material infection. This is to say that he does not suffer the results of pious or impious actions. Unless one is freed from a sinful life, he cannot become a Vaiṣṇava. In other words, if one is a Vaiṣṇava, his sinful life is certainly ended. According to //Padma Purāṇa://

> aprārabdha-phalaṁ pāpaṁ
> kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham
> krameṇaiva pralīyeta
> viṣṇu-bhakti-ratātmanām

"There are different stages of dormant reactions to sinful activities to be observed in a sinful life. Sinful reactions may be just waiting to take effect [//phalonmukha//], reactions may be still further dormant [//kūṭa//], or the reactions may be in a seedlike state [//bīja//]. In any case, all types of sinful reactions are vanquished one after another if a person engages in the devotional service of Lord Viṣṇu."
