**Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya also included several types of food that had been offered to Lord Jagannātha. This included sweetballs known as amṛta-guṭikā, sweet rice and cakes. All these were kept separately.**

===== Purport =====

Although the remnants of food left by Jagannātha were brought into Bhaṭṭācārya's house, they were kept separate from the preparations he had made at his home. It sometimes happens that //prasāda// is mixed with a larger quantity of food and then distributed, but in this case we find that Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya kept the //jagannātha-prasāda// separate. He kept it aside particularly for the satisfaction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
