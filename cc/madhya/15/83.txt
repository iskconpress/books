Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that Rāghava Paṇḍita was not simply a crazy fellow suffering from some cleansing phobia. He did not belong to the mundane world. In lower consciousness, accepting something to be spiritual when it is actually material is called //bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ.// Rāghava Paṇḍita was an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, and everything he saw was related to the service of the Lord. He was always absorbed in the transcendental thought of how he could always serve Kṛṣṇa with everything. Sometimes neophytes, devotees on the lower platform, try to imitate Rāghava Paṇḍita on the platform of material purity and impurity. Such imitation will not help anyone. As explained in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// (//Antya-līlā// 4.174): //bhadrābhadra-vastu-jñāna nāhika 'prākṛte'.// On the transcendental platform there is no higher or lower, pure or impure. On the material platform, distinction is made between good and bad, but on the spiritual platform everything is of the same quality.

"In the material world, conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculations. Therefore, saying, 'This is good, and this is bad, is all a mistake." [[books:cc:antya:4:176|(Cc. Antya 4.176)]]
