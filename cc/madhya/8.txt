~~Title:Cc. Madhya 8: Talks Between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya~~

====== Talks Between Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya ======

The summary of the Eighth Chapter is given by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in his //Amṛta-pravāha-bhāṣya.//

After visiting the temple of Jiyaḍa-nṛsiṁha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the banks of the river Godāvarī, to a place known as Vidyānagara. When Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya went there to take his bath, they met. After being introduced, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya requested Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to remain in the village for some days. Honoring his request, Caitanya Mahāprabhu stayed there in the home of some Vedic //brāhmaṇas.// In the evening, Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya used to come to see Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Rāmānanda Rāya, who was clothed in ordinary dress, offered the Lord respectful obeisances. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu questioned him on the object and process of worship and also asked him to recite verses from Vedic literature.

First of all, Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya enunciated the system of the //varṇāśrama// institution. He recited various verses about //karmārpaṇa,// stating that everything should be dedicated to the Lord. He then spoke of detached action, knowledge mixed with devotional service, and finally the spontaneous loving service of the Lord. After hearing Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya recite some verses, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the principle of pure devotional service devoid of all kinds of speculation. After this, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Rāmānanda Rāya to explain the higher platform of devotional service. Then Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya explained unalloyed devotional service, love of Godhead, and serving the Lord in the moods of pure servitude, fraternity and parental love. Finally he spoke of serving the Lord in conjugal love. He then spoke of how conjugal love can be developed in various ways. This conjugal love attains its highest perfection in Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī's love for Kṛṣṇa. He next described the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the transcendental mellows of love of God. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya then recited a verse of his own concerning the platform of ecstatic vision, technically called //prema-vilāsa-vivarta.// Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya also explained that all stages of conjugal love can be attained through the mercy of the residents of Vṛndāvana, especially by the mercy of the //gopīs.// All these subject matters were thus vividly described. Gradually Rāmānanda Rāya could understand the position of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His real form, Rāmānanda Rāya fell unconscious. After some days, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked Rāmānanda Rāya to retire from government service and come to Jagannātha Purī. These descriptions of the meetings between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are taken from the notebook of Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.

  ; [[.8:1|Cc. Madhya 8.1]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is known as Gaurāṅga, is the ocean of all conclusive knowledge in devotional service. He empowered Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, who may be likened to a cloud of devotional service. This cloud was filled with the water of all the conclusive purports of devotional service and was empowered by the ocean to spread this water over the ocean of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself. Thus the ocean of Caitanya Mahāprabhu became filled with the jewels of the knowledge of pure devotional service.

  ; [[.8:2|Cc. Madhya 8.2]]
  : All glories to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Advaita Ācārya! And all glories to all the devotees of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

  ; [[.8:3|Cc. Madhya 8.3]]
  : According to His previous program, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went forward on His tour and after some days arrived at the place of pilgrimage known as Jiyaḍa-nṛsiṁha.

  ; [[.8:4|Cc. Madhya 8.4]]
  : After seeing the Deity of Lord Nṛsiṁha in the temple, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu offered His respectful obeisances by falling flat. Then, in ecstatic love, He performed various dances, chanted, and offered prayers.

  ; [[.8:5|Cc. Madhya 8.5]]
  : " 'All glories to Nṛsiṁhadeva! All glories to Nṛsiṁhadeva, who is the Lord of Prahlāda Mahārāja and, like a honeybee, is always engaged in beholding the lotuslike face of the goddess of fortune.

  ; [[.8:6|Cc. Madhya 8.6]]
  : " 'Although very ferocious, the lioness is very kind to her cubs. Similarly, although very ferocious to nondevotees like Hiraṇyakaśipu, Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva is very, very soft and kind to devotees like Prahlāda Mahārāja.' "

  ; [[.8:7|Cc. Madhya 8.7]]
  : In this way Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recited different verses from the śāstra. The priest of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva then brought garlands and the remnants of the Lord's food and offered them to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.8:8|Cc. Madhya 8.8]]
  : As usual, a brāhmaṇa offered Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu an invitation. The Lord passed the night in the temple and then commenced His tour again.

  ; [[.8:9|Cc. Madhya 8.9]]
  : The next morning, in the great ecstasy of love, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started on His tour with no knowledge of the proper direction, and He continued the whole day and night.

  ; [[.8:10|Cc. Madhya 8.10]]
  : As previously, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu converted to Vaiṣṇavism many people He met on the road. After some days, the Lord reached the banks of the River Godāvarī.

  ; [[.8:11|Cc. Madhya 8.11]]
  : When He saw the River Godāvarī, the Lord remembered the River Yamunā, and when He saw the forest on the banks of the river, He remembered Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

  ; [[.8:12|Cc. Madhya 8.12]]
  : After performing His usual chanting and dancing for some time in this forest, the Lord crossed the river and took His bath on the other bank.

  ; [[.8:13|Cc. Madhya 8.13]]
  : After bathing in the river, the Lord walked a little distance from the bathing place and engaged in chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.8:14|Cc. Madhya 8.14]]
  : At that time, accompanied by the sounds of music, Rāmānanda Rāya came there on a palanquin to take his bath.

  ; [[.8:15|Cc. Madhya 8.15]]
  : Many brāhmaṇas, following the Vedic principles, accompanied Rāmānanda Rāya. According to the Vedic rituals, Rāmānanda Rāya took his bath and offered oblations to his forefathers.

  ; [[.8:16|Cc. Madhya 8.16]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu could understand that the person who had come to bathe in the river was Rāmānanda Rāya. The Lord wanted so much to meet him that His mind immediately began running after him.

  ; [[.8:17|Cc. Madhya 8.17]]
  : Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was running after him mentally, He patiently remained sitting. Rāmānanda Rāya, seeing the wonderful sannyāsī, then came to see Him.

  ; [[.8:18|Cc. Madhya 8.18]]
  : Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya then saw Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be as brilliant as a hundred suns. The Lord was covered by a saffron garment. He was large in body and very strongly built, and His eyes were like lotus petals.

  ; [[.8:19|Cc. Madhya 8.19]]
  : When Rāmānanda Rāya saw the wonderful sannyāsī, he was struck with wonder. He went to Him and immediately offered his respectful obeisances, falling down flat like a rod.

  ; [[.8:20|Cc. Madhya 8.20]]
  : The Lord stood up and asked Rāmānanda Rāya to arise and chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very eager to embrace him.

  ; [[.8:21|Cc. Madhya 8.21]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then inquired whether he was Rāmānanda Rāya, and he replied, "Yes, I am Your very low servant, and I belong to the śūdra community."

  ; [[.8:22|Cc. Madhya 8.22]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then embraced Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya very firmly. Indeed, both the master and the servant almost lost consciousness due to ecstatic love.

  ; [[.8:23|Cc. Madhya 8.23]]
  : Their natural love for each other was awakened in them both, and they embraced and fell down on the ground.

  ; [[.8:24|Cc. Madhya 8.24]]
  : When they embraced each other, ecstatic symptoms-paralysis, perspiration, tears, shivering, paleness and standing up of the bodily hairs-appeared. The word "Kṛṣṇa" came from their mouths falteringly.

  ; [[.8:25|Cc. Madhya 8.25]]
  : When the stereotyped, ritualistic brāhmaṇas who were following the Vedic principles saw this ecstatic manifestation of love, they were struck with wonder. All these brāhmaṇas began to reflect as follows.

  ; [[.8:26|Cc. Madhya 8.26]]
  : These brāhmaṇas began to think, "We can see that this sannyāsī has a luster like the effulgence of Brahman, but how is it He is crying upon embracing a śūdra, a member of the fourth caste in the social order?"

  ; [[.8:27|Cc. Madhya 8.27]]
  : They thought, "This Rāmānanda Rāya is the Governor of Madras, a highly learned and grave person, a mahā-paṇḍita, but upon touching this sannyāsī he has become restless like a madman."

  ; [[.8:28|Cc. Madhya 8.28]]
  : While the brāhmaṇas were thinking in this way about the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw those outsiders and restrained His transcendental emotions.

  ; [[.8:29|Cc. Madhya 8.29]]
  : When they regained their sanity, they both sat down, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled and began to speak as follows.

  ; [[.8:30|Cc. Madhya 8.30]]
  : "Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya spoke of your good qualities, and he made a great endeavor to convince Me to meet you.

  ; [[.8:31|Cc. Madhya 8.31]]
  : "Indeed, I have come here just to meet you. It is very good that even without making an effort I have gotten your interview here."

  ; [[.8:32|Cc. Madhya 8.32]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya thinks of me as his servant. Even in my absence he is very careful to do me good.

  ; [[.8:33|Cc. Madhya 8.33]]
  : "By his mercy I have received Your interview here. Consequently I consider that today I have become a successful human being.

  ; [[.8:34|Cc. Madhya 8.34]]
  : "I can see that You have bestowed special mercy upon Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. Therefore You have touched me, although I am untouchable. This is due only to his love for You.

  ; [[.8:35|Cc. Madhya 8.35]]
  : "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa Himself, and I am only a government servant interested in materialistic activities. Indeed, I am the lowest amongst men of the fourth caste.

  ; [[.8:36|Cc. Madhya 8.36]]
  : "You do not fear the Vedic injunctions stating that You should not associate with a śūdra. You were not contemptuous of my touch, although in the Vedas You are forbidden to associate with śūdras.

  ; [[.8:37|Cc. Madhya 8.37]]
  : "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself; therefore no one can understand Your purpose. By Your mercy You are touching me, although this is not sanctioned by the Vedas.

  ; [[.8:38|Cc. Madhya 8.38]]
  : "You have come here specifically to deliver me. You are so merciful that You alone can deliver all fallen souls.

  ; [[.8:39|Cc. Madhya 8.39]]
  : "It is the general practice of all saintly people to deliver the fallen. Therefore they go to people's houses, although they have no personal business there.

  ; [[.8:40|Cc. Madhya 8.40]]
  : " 'My dear Lord, sometimes great saintly persons go to the homes of householders, although these householders are generally low-minded. When a saintly person visits their homes, one can understand that it is for no other purpose than to benefit the householders.'

  ; [[.8:41|Cc. Madhya 8.41]]
  : "Along with me there are about a thousand men-including the brāhmaṇas-and all of them appear to have had their hearts melted simply by seeing You.

  ; [[.8:42|Cc. Madhya 8.42]]
  : "I hear everyone chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. Everyone's body is thrilled with ecstasy, and there are tears in everyone's eyes.

  ; [[.8:43|Cc. Madhya 8.43]]
  : "My dear Sir, according to Your behavior and bodily features, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is impossible for ordinary living beings to possess such transcendental qualities."

  ; [[.8:44|Cc. Madhya 8.44]]
  : The Lord replied to Rāmānanda Rāya, "Sir, you are the best of the topmost devotees; therefore simply the sight of you has melted everyone's heart.

  ; [[.8:45|Cc. Madhya 8.45]]
  : "Although I am a Māyāvādī sannyāsī, a nondevotee, I am also floating in the ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa simply by touching you. And what to speak of others?

  ; [[.8:46|Cc. Madhya 8.46]]
  : "Knowing this, in order to rectify My heart, which is very hard, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya asked Me to meet you."

  ; [[.8:47|Cc. Madhya 8.47]]
  : In this way each of them praised the qualities of the other, and both of them were pleased to see each other.

  ; [[.8:48|Cc. Madhya 8.48]]
  : At this time a brāhmaṇa Vaiṣṇava following the Vedic principles came and offered obeisances. He fell flat before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and invited Him for lunch.

  ; [[.8:49|Cc. Madhya 8.49]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the brāhmaṇa's invitation, knowing him to be a devotee, and, slightly smiling, spoke as follows to Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.8:50|Cc. Madhya 8.50]]
  : "I wish to hear from you about Lord Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, My mind is inclined to desire this; therefore I wish to see you again."

  ; [[.8:51-52|Cc. Madhya 8.51-52]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "My Lord, although You have come to correct me, a fallen soul, my mind is not yet purified simply by seeing You. Please stay for five or seven days and kindly cleanse my polluted mind. After that much time, my mind will certainly be pure."

  ; [[.8:53|Cc. Madhya 8.53]]
  : Although neither could tolerate the other's separation, Rāmānanda Rāya nonetheless offered his obeisances to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and departed.

  ; [[.8:54|Cc. Madhya 8.54]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then went to the house of the brāhmaṇa who had invited Him and took His lunch there. When the evening of that day arrived, both Rāmānanda Rāya and the Lord were eager to meet each other again.

  ; [[.8:55|Cc. Madhya 8.55]]
  : After finishing His evening bath, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down and waited for Rāmānanda Rāya to come. Then Rāmānanda Rāya, accompanied by one servant, came to meet Him.

  ; [[.8:56|Cc. Madhya 8.56]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya approached Lord Śrī Caitanya and offered his respectful obeisances, and the Lord embraced him. Then they began to discuss Kṛṣṇa in a secluded place.

  ; [[.8:57|Cc. Madhya 8.57]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered Rāmānanda Rāya to recite a verse from the revealed scriptures concerning the ultimate goal of life. Rāmānanda replied that if one executes the prescribed duties of his social position, he awakens his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

  ; [[.8:58|Cc. Madhya 8.58]]
  : "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of varṇa and āśrama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One must be situated in the institution of the four varṇas and āśramas."

  ; [[.8:59|Cc. Madhya 8.59]]
  : The Lord replied, "This is external. You had better tell Me of some other means." Rāmānanda replied, "To offer the results of one's activities to Kṛṣṇa is the essence of all perfection."

  ; [[.8:60|Cc. Madhya 8.60]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, " 'My dear son of Kuntī, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give in charity, and whatever austerities you perform, all the results of such activities should be offered to Me, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' "

  ; [[.8:61|Cc. Madhya 8.61]]
  : "This is also external," Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. "Please proceed and speak further on this matter." Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "To give up one's occupational duties in the varṇāśrama is the essence of perfection."

  ; [[.8:62|Cc. Madhya 8.62]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, " 'Occupational duties are described in the religious scriptures. If one analyzes them, he can fully understand their qualities and faults and then give them up completely to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a person is considered a first-class man.'

  ; [[.8:63|Cc. Madhya 8.63]]
  : "As stated in scripture, 'After giving up all kinds of religious and occupational duties, if you come to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and take shelter, I will give you protection from all of life's sinful reactions. Do not worry.' "

  ; [[.8:64|Cc. Madhya 8.64]]
  : After hearing Rāmānanda Rāya speak in this way, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu again rejected his statement and said, "Go ahead and say something more." Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, "Devotional service mixed with empiric knowledge is the essence of perfection."

  ; [[.8:65|Cc. Madhya 8.65]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, "According to the //Bhagavad-gītā,// 'One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.' "

  ; [[.8:66|Cc. Madhya 8.66]]
  : After hearing this, the Lord, as usual, rejected it, considering it to be external devotional service. He again asked Rāmānanda Rāya to speak further, and Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Pure devotional service without any touch of speculative knowledge is the essence of perfection."

  ; [[.8:67|Cc. Madhya 8.67]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, "Lord Brahmā said, 'My dear Lord, those devotees who have thrown away the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth and have therefore abandoned discussing empiric philosophical truths should hear from self-realized devotees about Your holy name, form, pastimes and qualities. They should completely follow the principles of devotional service and remain free from illicit sex, gambling, intoxication and animal slaughter. Surrendering themselves fully with body, words and mind, they can live in any āśrama or social status. Indeed, You are conquered by such persons, although You are always unconquerable.' "

  ; [[.8:68|Cc. Madhya 8.68]]
  : At this point, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "This is all right, but still you can speak more on the subject." Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, "Ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of all perfection."

  ; [[.8:69|Cc. Madhya 8.69]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, " 'As long as there is hunger and thirst within the stomach, varieties of food and drink make one feel very happy. Similarly, when the Lord is worshiped with pure love, the various activities performed in the course of that worship awaken transcendental bliss in the heart of the devotee.'

  ; [[.8:70|Cc. Madhya 8.70]]
  : " 'Pure devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be had even by pious activity in hundreds and thousands of lives. It can be attained only by paying one price---that is, intense greed to obtain it. If it is available somewhere, one must purchase it without delay.' "

  ; [[.8:71|Cc. Madhya 8.71]]
  : Hearing up to the point of spontaneous love, the Lord said, "This is all right, but if you know more, please tell Me." In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, "Spontaneous loving service in servitude-as exchanged by master and servant-is the highest perfection.

  ; [[.8:72|Cc. Madhya 8.72]]
  : " 'A man becomes purified simply by hearing the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose lotus feet create the holy places of pilgrimage. Therefore what remains to be attained by those who have become His servants?'

  ; [[.8:73|Cc. Madhya 8.73]]
  : " 'By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is completely pacified. When shall I engage as Your permanent eternal servant and always feel joyful to have such a perfect master?' "

  ; [[.8:74|Cc. Madhya 8.74]]
  : Hearing this from Rāmānanda Rāya, the Lord again requested him to go a step further. In reply, Rāmānanda Rāya said, "Loving service to Kṛṣṇa rendered in fraternity is the highest perfection.

  ; [[.8:75|Cc. Madhya 8.75]]
  : " 'Neither those who are engaged in self-realization, appreciating the Brahman effulgence of the Lord, nor those engaged in devotional service while accepting the Supreme Personality of Godhead as master, nor those who are under the clutches of Māyā, thinking the Lord an ordinary person, can understand that certain exalted personalities-after accumulating volumes of pious activities-are now playing with the Lord in friendship as cowherd boys.' "

  ; [[.8:76|Cc. Madhya 8.76]]
  : The Lord said, "This statement is very good, but please proceed even further." Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, "Loving service to the Lord in the parental relationship is the highest perfectional stage."

  ; [[.8:77|Cc. Madhya 8.77]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, " 'O brāhmaṇa, what pious activities did Nanda Mahārāja perform by which he received the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa as his son, and what pious activities did mother Yaśodā perform that made the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa call her "mother" and suck her breasts?'

  ; [[.8:78|Cc. Madhya 8.78]]
  : " 'The favor mother Yaśodā obtained from Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the bestower of liberation, was never obtained even by Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva, nor even by the goddess of fortune, who always remains on the chest of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu.' "

  ; [[.8:79|Cc. Madhya 8.79]]
  : The Lord said, "Your statements are certainly getting better and better one after the other, but surpassing all of them is another transcendental mellow, and you can speak of that as the most sublime." Rāmānanda Rāya then replied, "Conjugal attachment for Kṛṣṇa is the topmost position in love of Godhead.

  ; [[.8:80|Cc. Madhya 8.80]]
  : " 'When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, He put His arms around their necks and embraced them. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or the other consorts in the spiritual world. Nor was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, girls whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who may be very, very beautiful according to material estimation?'

  ; [[.8:81|Cc. Madhya 8.81]]
  : " 'Suddenly, due to the their feelings of separation, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared among the gopīs dressed in yellow garments and wearing a flower garland. His lotus face was smiling, and He was directly attracting the mind of Cupid.'

  ; [[.8:82|Cc. Madhya 8.82]]
  : "There are various means and processes by which one may attain the favor of Lord Kṛṣṇa. All those transcendental processes will be studied from the viewpoint of comparative importance.

  ; [[.8:83|Cc. Madhya 8.83]]
  : "It is true that whatever relationship a particular devotee has with the Lord is the best for him; still, when we study all the different methods from a neutral position, we can understand that there are higher and lower degrees of love.

  ; [[.8:84|Cc. Madhya 8.84]]
  : " 'Increasing love is experienced in various tastes, one above another. But that love which has the highest taste in the gradual succession of desires manifests itself in the form of conjugal love.'

  ; [[.8:85|Cc. Madhya 8.85]]
  : "There is a gradual order of improvement in transcendental mellows from the initial ones to the later ones. In each subsequent mellow the qualities of the previous mellows are manifest, counting from two, then three, and up to the point of five complete qualities.

  ; [[.8:86|Cc. Madhya 8.86]]
  : "As the qualities increase, so the taste also increases in each and every mellow. Therefore the qualities found in śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa and vātsalya-rasa are all manifest in conjugal love [mādhurya-rasa].

  ; [[.8:87|Cc. Madhya 8.87]]
  : "The qualities in the material elements-sky, air, fire, water and earth-increase one after another by a gradual process of one, two and three, and at the last stage, in the element earth, all five qualities are completely visible.

  ; [[.8:88|Cc. Madhya 8.88]]
  : "Complete attainment of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa is made possible by love of Godhead, specifically mādhurya-rasa, or conjugal love. Lord Kṛṣṇa is indeed captivated by this standard of love. This is stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

  ; [[.8:89|Cc. Madhya 8.89]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa told the gopīs, 'The means of attaining My favor is loving service unto Me, and fortunately you are all thus engaged. Those living beings who render service unto Me are eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world and attain eternal life with knowledge and bliss.'

  ; [[.8:90|Cc. Madhya 8.90]]
  : "Lord Kṛṣṇa has made a firm promise for all time. If one renders service unto Him, Kṛṣṇa correspondingly gives him an equal amount of success in devotional service to the Lord.

  ; [[.8:91|Cc. Madhya 8.91]]
  : "According to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [4.11],'As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā.'

  ; [[.8:92|Cc. Madhya 8.92]]
  : "In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam [10.32.22] it is said that Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot proportionately reciprocate devotional service in the mādhurya-rasa; therefore He always remains a debtor to such devotees.

  ; [[.8:93|Cc. Madhya 8.93]]
  : "When the gopīs were overwhelmed with dissatisfaction due to Lord Kṛṣṇa's absence from the rāsa-līlā, Kṛṣṇa returned to them and told them, 'My dear gopīs, our meeting is certainly free from all material contamination. I must admit that in many lives it would be impossible for Me to repay My debt to you because you have cut off the bondage of family life just to search for Me. Consequently I am unable to repay you. Therefore please be satisfied with your honest activities in this regard.'

  ; [[.8:94|Cc. Madhya 8.94]]
  : "Although Kṛṣṇa's unparalleled beauty is the topmost sweetness of love of Godhead, His sweetness increases unlimitedly when He is in the company of the gopīs. Consequently Kṛṣṇa's exchange of love with the gopīs is the topmost perfection of love of Godhead.

  ; [[.8:95|Cc. Madhya 8.95]]
  : " 'Although the son of Devakī, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is also the reservoir of all kinds of beauty, when He is among the gopīs He nonetheless becomes more beautiful, for He resembles a mārakata jewel surrounded by gold and other jewels.' "

  ; [[.8:96|Cc. Madhya 8.96]]

  ; [[.8:143|Cc. Madhya 8.143]]

  : " 'My dear Lord, You are the transcendental reservoir of all transcendental qualities. Your pleasure potency, existence potency and knowledge potency are actually all one spiritual internal potency.

But because You are above all material qualities, these are not found in You. Your superior spiritual potency is completely transcendental, and for You there is no such thing as relative pleasure, pleasure mixed with pain, or pain itself.'

  ; [[.8:157|Cc. Madhya 8.157]]

  ; [[.8:196|Cc. Madhya 8.196]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirmed these verses recited by Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, saying, "This is the limit of the goal of human life. Only by your mercy have I come to understand it conclusively.

  ; [[.8:197|Cc. Madhya 8.197]]
  : "The goal of life cannot be achieved unless one practices the process. Now, being merciful upon Me, please explain that means by which this goal can be attained."

  ; [[.8:198|Cc. Madhya 8.198]]
  : Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "I do not know what I am saying, but You have made me speak what I have spoken, be it good or bad. I am simply repeating that message.

  ; [[.8:199|Cc. Madhya 8.199]]
  : "Within these three worlds who is so undisturbed that he can remain steady as You manipulate Your different energies?

  ; [[.8:200|Cc. Madhya 8.200]]
  : "Actually You are speaking through my mouth, and at the same time You are listening. This is very mysterious. Anyway, kindly hear the explanation by which the goal can be attained.

  ; [[.8:201|Cc. Madhya 8.201]]
  : "The pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are very confidential. They cannot be understood through the mellows of servitude, fraternity or paternal affection.

  ; [[.8:202|Cc. Madhya 8.202]]
  : "Actually, only the gopīs have the right to appreciate these transcendental pastimes, and only from them can these pastimes be expanded.

  ; [[.8:203|Cc. Madhya 8.203]]
  : "Without the gopīs, these pastimes between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa cannot be nourished. Only by their cooperation are such pastimes broadcast. It is their business to taste the mellows.

  ; [[.8:204-205|Cc. Madhya 8.204-205]]
  : "Without the help of the gopīs, one cannot enter into these pastimes. Only he who worships the Lord in the ecstasy of the gopīs, following in their footsteps, can engage in the service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in the bushes of Vṛndāvana. Only then can one understand the conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. There is no other procedure for understanding.

  ; [[.8:206|Cc. Madhya 8.206]]
  : " 'The pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are self-effulgent. They are happiness personified, unlimited and all-powerful. Even so, the spiritual humors of such pastimes are never complete without the gopīs, the Lord's personal friends. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never complete without His spiritual potencies; therefore unless one takes shelter of the gopīs, one cannot enter into the company of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Who can be interested in Their spiritual pastimes without taking their shelter?'

  ; [[.8:207|Cc. Madhya 8.207]]
  : "There is an inexplicable fact about the natural inclinations of the gopīs. The gopīs never want to enjoy themselves with Kṛṣṇa personally.

  ; [[.8:208|Cc. Madhya 8.208]]
  : "The happiness of the gopīs increases ten million times when they serve to engage Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in Their transcendental pastimes.

  ; [[.8:209|Cc. Madhya 8.209]]
  : "By nature, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is just like a creeper of love of Godhead, and the gopīs are the twigs, flowers and leaves of that creeper.

  ; [[.8:210|Cc. Madhya 8.210]]
  : "When the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes is sprinkled on that creeper, the happiness derived by the twigs, flowers and leaves is ten million times greater than that derived by the creeper itself.

  ; [[.8:211|Cc. Madhya 8.211]]
  : " 'All the gopīs, the personal friends of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, are equal to Her. Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to the inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi, just as the moon is pleasing to the lotus flower. His pleasure-giving potency is known as āhlādinī, of which the active principle is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. She is compared to a creeper with newly grown flowers and leaves. When the nectar of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes is sprinkled on Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, all Her friends, the gopīs, immediately appreciate the pleasure a hundred times more than if they were sprinkled themselves. Actually this is not at all wonderful.'

  ; [[.8:212|Cc. Madhya 8.212]]
  : "Although the gopīs, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī's friends, do not desire to enjoy themselves directly with Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī makes a great endeavor to induce Kṛṣṇa to enjoy Himself with the gopīs.

  ; [[.8:213|Cc. Madhya 8.213]]
  : "Presenting various pleas for the gopīs, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī sometimes sends the gopīs to Kṛṣṇa just to enable them to associate with Him directly. At such times, She enjoys a happiness ten million times greater than that enjoyed through direct association.

  ; [[.8:214|Cc. Madhya 8.214]]
  : "The transcendental mellow is nourished by that mutual behavior in transcendental love of Godhead. When Lord Kṛṣṇa sees how the gopīs have developed pure love for Him, He becomes very satisfied.

  ; [[.8:215|Cc. Madhya 8.215]]
  : "It is to be noted that the natural characteristic of the gopīs is to love the Supreme Lord. Their lusty desire is not to be compared to material lust. Nonetheless, because their desire sometimes appears to resemble material lust, their transcendental love for Kṛṣṇa is sometimes described as lust.

  ; [[.8:216|Cc. Madhya 8.216]]
  : " 'The dealings of the gopīs with Kṛṣṇa are on the platform of pure love of Godhead, yet they are sometimes considered to be lusty. But because such dealings are completely spiritual, Uddhava and all the other dearmost devotees of the Lord  desire to participate in them.'

  ; [[.8:217|Cc. Madhya 8.217]]
  : "Lusty desires are experienced when one is concerned with his own personal sense gratification. The mood of the gopīs is not like that. Their only desire is to satisfy the senses of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.8:218|Cc. Madhya 8.218]]
  : "Among the gopīs, there is not a pinch of desire for sense gratification. Their only desire is to give pleasure to Kṛṣṇa, and this is why they mingle with Him and enjoy with Him.

  ; [[.8:219|Cc. Madhya 8.219]]
  : "All the gopīs said, 'Dear Kṛṣṇa, we carefully hold Your delicate lotus feet upon our hard breasts. When You walk in the forest, Your soft lotus feet are pricked by small bits of stone. We fear that this is paining You. Since You are our life and soul, and our minds are very disturbed when Your lotus feet are pained.'

  ; [[.8:220|Cc. Madhya 8.220]]
  : "One who is attracted by that ecstatic love of the gopīs does not care about popular opinion or the regulative principles of Vedic life. Rather, he completely surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa and renders service unto Him.

  ; [[.8:221|Cc. Madhya 8.221]]
  : "If one worships the Lord on the path of spontaneous love and goes to Vṛndāvana, he receives the shelter of Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

  ; [[.8:222|Cc. Madhya 8.222]]
  : "In his liberated stage the devotee is attracted by one of the five humors in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As he continues to serve the Lord in that transcendental mood, he attains a spiritual body to serve Kṛṣṇa in Goloka Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.8:223|Cc. Madhya 8.223]]
  : "Those saintly persons who presented the Upaniṣads are vivid examples of this. By worshiping the Lord on the path of spontaneous love, they attained the lotus feet of Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

  ; [[.8:224|Cc. Madhya 8.224]]
  : " 'Great sages conquer the mind and senses by practicing the mystic yoga system and controlling their breath. Thus engaging in mystic yoga, they see the Supersoul within their hearts and ultimately enter into impersonal Brahman. But even the enemies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead attain that position simply by thinking of the Supreme Lord. However, the damsels of Vraja, the gopīs, being attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, simply wanted to embrace Him and His arms, which are like serpents. Thus the gopīs ultimately tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, we Upaniṣads can also taste the nectar of His lotus feet by following in the footsteps of the gopīs.' "

  ; [[.8:225|Cc. Madhya 8.225]]
  : "The word 'sama-dṛśaḥ,' mentioned in the fourth line of the previous verse, means 'following the mood of the gopīs.' The word 'samāḥ' means 'the śrutis' attaining a body like those of the gopīs.'

  ; [[.8:226|Cc. Madhya 8.226]]
  : "The word 'aṅghri-padma-sudhā' means 'associating intimately with Kṛṣṇa.' One can attain such perfection only by spontaneous love of God. One cannot obtain Kṛṣṇa in Goloka Vṛndāvana simply by serving the Lord according to regulative principles.

  ; [[.8:227|Cc. Madhya 8.227]]
  : " 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, the son of mother Yaśodā, is accessible to those devotees engaged in spontaneous loving service, but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for self-realization by severe austerities and penances, or to those who consider the body the same as the self.'

  ; [[.8:228|Cc. Madhya 8.228]]
  : "Therefore one should accept the mood of the gopīs in their service. In such a transcendental mood, one should always think of the pastimes of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.8:229|Cc. Madhya 8.229]]
  : "After thinking of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and Their pastimes for a long time and after getting completely free from material contamination, one is transferred to the spiritual world. There the devotee attains an opportunity to serve Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa as one of the gopīs.

  ; [[.8:230|Cc. Madhya 8.230]]
  : "Unless one follows in the footsteps of the gopīs, he cannot attain the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, the son of Nanda Mahārāja. If one is overcome by knowledge of the Lord's opulence, he cannot attain the Lord's lotus feet, even though he is engaged in devotional service.

  ; [[.8:231|Cc. Madhya 8.231]]
  : "The unspoken example in this connection is the goddess of fortune, who worshiped Lord Kṛṣṇa in order to attain His pastimes in Vṛndāvana. But due to her opulent life-style, she could not attain the service of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana.

  ; [[.8:232|Cc. Madhya 8.232]]
  : " 'When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced around the neck by the Lord's arms. This transcendental favor was never enjoyed by the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Nor was such a thing ever imagined by the most beautiful girls from the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma exactly resemble a lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to the material estimation?' "

  ; [[.8:233|Cc. Madhya 8.233]]
  : After hearing this, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu embraced Rāmānanda Rāya, and both of them, embracing shoulder to shoulder, began to cry.

  ; [[.8:234|Cc. Madhya 8.234]]
  : The entire night was passed in this way, in ecstatic love of Godhead. In the morning they both departed to tend to their respective duties.

  ; [[.8:235|Cc. Madhya 8.235]]
  : Before departing from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Rāmānanda Rāya fell to the ground and caught hold of the Lord's lotus feet. He then spoke submissively as follows.

  ; [[.8:236|Cc. Madhya 8.236]]
  : Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya said, "You have come here just to show me Your causeless mercy. Therefore stay here for at least ten days and purify my polluted mind.

  ; [[.8:237|Cc. Madhya 8.237]]
  : "But for You, there is no one who can deliver all the living entities, for You alone can deliver love of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.8:238|Cc. Madhya 8.238]]
  : The Lord replied, "Having heard about your good qualities, I have come here. I have come to hear about Kṛṣṇa from you and thus purify My mind.

  ; [[.8:239|Cc. Madhya 8.239]]
  : "Now that I have actually seen your glories, what I heard about you is confirmed. As far as the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in a loving mood are concerned, you are the limit of knowledge."

  ; [[.8:240|Cc. Madhya 8.240]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "To say nothing of ten days, as long as I live I shall find it impossible to give up your company.

  ; [[.8:241|Cc. Madhya 8.241]]
  : "You and I shall remain together at Jagannātha Purī. We shall pass our time together in joy, talking about Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes."

  ; [[.8:242|Cc. Madhya 8.242]]
  : In this way they both departed to perform their respective duties. Then, in the evening, Rāmānanda Rāya returned to see Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.8:243|Cc. Madhya 8.243]]
  : Thus they met time and time again, sitting in a secluded place and jubilantly discussing devotional service by the question and answer process.

  ; [[.8:244|Cc. Madhya 8.244]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked the questions, and Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya gave the answers. In this way they were engaged in discussion throughout the night.

  ; [[.8:245|Cc. Madhya 8.245]]
  : On one occasion the Lord inquired, "Of all types of education, which is the most important?" Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "No education is important other than the transcendental devotional service of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.8:246|Cc. Madhya 8.246]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then asked Rāmānanda Rāya, "Out of all glorious activities, which is the most glorious?" Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "That person who is reputed to be a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoys the utmost fame and glory."

  ; [[.8:247|Cc. Madhya 8.247]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Of the many capitalists who possess great riches, who is the topmost?" Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "He who is richest in love for Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is the greatest capitalist."

  ; [[.8:248|Cc. Madhya 8.248]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Of all kinds of distress, what is the most painful?"
Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Apart from separation from the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, I know of no unbearable unhappiness."

  ; [[.8:249|Cc. Madhya 8.249]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then inquired, "Out of all liberated persons, who should be accepted as the greatest?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "He who has love for Kṛṣṇa has attained the topmost liberation."

  ; [[.8:250|Cc. Madhya 8.250]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu next asked Rāmānanda Rāya, "Among many songs, which song is to be considered the actual religion of the living entity?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "That song describing the loving affairs of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is superior to all other songs."

  ; [[.8:251|Cc. Madhya 8.251]]
  : "Out of all auspicious and beneficial activities, which is best for the living entity?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "The only auspicious activity is association with the devotees of Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.8:252|Cc. Madhya 8.252]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "What should all living entities constantly remember?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "The chief objects of remembrance are always the Lord's holy name, qualities and pastimes."

  ; [[.8:253|Cc. Madhya 8.253]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu further inquired, "Out of many types of meditation, which is required for all living entities?"
Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "The chief duty of every living entity is to meditate upon the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa."

  ; [[.8:254|Cc. Madhya 8.254]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Where should the living entity live, abandoning all other places?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "The holy place known as Vṛndāvana or Vrajabhūmi, where the Lord performed His rāsa dance."

  ; [[.8:255|Cc. Madhya 8.255]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Out of all topics people listen to, which is best for all living entities?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Hearing about the loving affairs between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa is most pleasing to the ear."

  ; [[.8:256|Cc. Madhya 8.256]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked, "Among all worshipable objects, which is the chief?"
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "The chief worshipable object is the holy name of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra."

  ; [[.8:257|Cc. Madhya 8.257]]
  : "And what is the destination of those who desire liberation and those who desire sense gratification?" Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked.
Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "Those who attempt to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord will have to accept a body like that of a tree. And those who are overly inclined toward sense gratification will attain the bodies of demigods."

  ; [[.8:258|Cc. Madhya 8.258]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, "Those who are devoid of all transcendental mellows are like the crows that suck the juice from the bitter fruits of the nimba tree of knowledge, whereas those who enjoy mellows are like the cuckoos who eat the buds of the mango tree of love of Godhead."

  ; [[.8:259|Cc. Madhya 8.259]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya concluded, "The unfortunate empiric philosophers taste the dry process of philosophical knowledge, whereas the devotees regularly drink the nectar of love of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are most fortunate of all."

  ; [[.8:260|Cc. Madhya 8.260]]
  : In this way Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya passed the full night relishing the mellow of kṛṣṇa-kathā, topics about Kṛṣṇa. While they were chanting, dancing and crying, the night ended.

  ; [[.8:261|Cc. Madhya 8.261]]
  : The next morning they both departed to perform their respective duties, but in the evening Rāmānanda Rāya returned to meet the Lord again.

  ; [[.8:262|Cc. Madhya 8.262]]
  : That next evening, after discussing the topic of Kṛṣṇa for some time, Rāmānanda Rāya caught hold of the lotus feet of the Lord and spoke as follows.

  ; [[.8:263|Cc. Madhya 8.263]]
  : "There is transcendental variety in talks about Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī and Their transcendental loving affairs, humors and pastimes."

  ; [[.8:264|Cc. Madhya 8.264]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya then admitted, "You have manifested many transcendental truths in my heart. This is exactly the way Nārāyaṇa educated Lord Brahmā."

  ; [[.8:265|Cc. Madhya 8.265]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, "The Supersoul within everyone's heart speaks not externally but from within. He instructs the devotees in all respects, and that is His way of instruction."

  ; [[.8:266|Cc. Madhya 8.266]]
  : " 'O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Sri Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.' "

  ; [[.8:267|Cc. Madhya 8.267]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya then said that he had but one doubt within his heart, and he petitioned the Lord, "Please be merciful upon me and just remove my doubt."

  ; [[.8:268|Cc. Madhya 8.268]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya then told Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "At first I saw You appear like a sannyāsī, but now I am seeing You as Śyāmasundara, the cowherd boy.

  ; [[.8:269|Cc. Madhya 8.269]]
  : "I now see You appearing like a golden doll, and Your entire body appears covered by a golden luster.

  ; [[.8:270|Cc. Madhya 8.270]]
  : "I see that You are holding a flute to Your mouth, and Your lotus eyes are moving very restlessly due to various ecstasies.

  ; [[.8:271|Cc. Madhya 8.271]]
  : "I actually see You in this way, and this is very wonderful. My Lord, please tell me without duplicity what is causing this."

  ; [[.8:272|Cc. Madhya 8.272]]
  : Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "You have a deep love for Kṛṣṇa, and one who has such deep ecstatic love for the Lord naturally sees things in such a way. Please take this from Me to be certain.

  ; [[.8:273|Cc. Madhya 8.273]]
  : "A devotee advanced on the spiritual platform sees everything movable and inert as the Supreme Lord. For him, everything he sees here and there is but a manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.8:274|Cc. Madhya 8.274]]
  : "The mahā-bhāgavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord."

  ; [[.8:275|Cc. Madhya 8.275]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, " 'A person advanced in devotional service sees within everything the soul of souls, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Consequently he always sees the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of all causes and understands that all things are situated in Him.'

  ; [[.8:276|Cc. Madhya 8.276]]
  : " 'The plants, creepers and trees were full of fruits and flowers due to ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, being so full, they were bowing down. They were inspired by such deep love for Kṛṣṇa that they were constantly pouring showers of honey. In this way the gopīs saw all the forest of Vṛndāvana.' "

  ; [[.8:277|Cc. Madhya 8.277]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu continued, "My dear Rāya, you are an advanced devotee and are always filled with ecstatic love for Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever you see-anywhere and everywhere-simply awakens your Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

  ; [[.8:278|Cc. Madhya 8.278]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya replied, "My dear Lord, please give up all these serious talks. Please do not conceal Your real form from me."

  ; [[.8:279|Cc. Madhya 8.279]]
  : Rāmānanda Rāya continued, "My dear Lord, I can understand that You have assumed the ecstasy and bodily complexion of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. By accepting this, You are tasting Your own personal transcendental humor and have therefore appeared as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

  ; [[.8:280|Cc. Madhya 8.280]]
  : "My dear Lord, You have descended in this incarnation of Lord Caitanya for Your own personal reasons. You have come to taste Your own spiritual bliss, and at the same time You are transforming the whole world by spreading the ecstasy of love of Godhead.

  ; [[.8:281|Cc. Madhya 8.281]]
  : "My dear Lord, by Your causeless mercy You have appeared before me to grant me liberation. Now You are playing in a duplicitous way. What is the reason for this behavior?"

  ; [[.8:282|Cc. Madhya 8.282]]
  : Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the personification of ecstatic love of Godhead. These two forms has combined as one in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This being the case, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu revealed His real form to Rāmānanda Rāya.

  ; [[.8:283|Cc. Madhya 8.283]]
  : Upon seeing this form, Rāmānanda Rāya lost consciousness in transcendental bliss. Unable to remain standing, he fell to the ground.

  ; [[.8:284|Cc. Madhya 8.284]]
  : When Rāmānanda Rāya fell to the ground unconscious, Caitanya Mahāprabhu touched his hand, and he immediately regained consciousness. But when he saw Lord Caitanya in the dress of a sannyāsī, he was struck with wonder.

  ; [[.8:285|Cc. Madhya 8.285]]
  : After embracing Rāmānanda Rāya, the Lord pacified him, informing him, "But for you, no one has ever seen this form."

  ; [[.8:286|Cc. Madhya 8.286]]
  : Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirmed, "All the truths about My pastimes and mellows are within your knowledge. Therefore I have shown this form to you.

  ; [[.8:287|Cc. Madhya 8.287]]
  : "Actually My body does not have a golden complexion. It only appears so because it has touched the body of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. However, She does not touch anyone but the son of Nanda Mahārāja.

  ; [[.8:288|Cc. Madhya 8.288]]
  : "I have now converted My body and mind into the ecstasy of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī; thus I am tasting My own personal sweetness in that form."

  ; [[.8:289|Cc. Madhya 8.289]]
  : Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu then admitted to His pure devotee, Rāmānanda Rāya, "Now there is no confidential activity unknown to you. Even though I try to conceal My activities, you can understand everything in detail by virtue of your advanced love for Me."

  ; [[.8:290|Cc. Madhya 8.290]]
  : The Lord then requested Rāmānanda Rāya, "Keep all these talks a secret. Please do not expose them anywhere and everywhere. Since My activities appear to be like those of a madman, people may take them lightly and laugh."

  ; [[.8:291|Cc. Madhya 8.291]]
  : Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "Indeed, I am a madman, and you are also a madman. Therefore both of us are on the same platform."

  ; [[.8:292|Cc. Madhya 8.292]]
  : For ten nights Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānanda Rāya spent a happy time discussing the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa.

  ; [[.8:293|Cc. Madhya 8.293]]
  : The conversations between Rāmānanda Rāya and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu contain the most confidential subject matters touching the conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana [Vrajabhūmi]. Although they talked at great length about these pastimes, they could not reach the limit of discussion.

  ; [[.8:294|Cc. Madhya 8.294]]
