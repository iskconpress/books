**The extraordinary transformations of the body due to transcendental feelings would never have been possible for anyone but the Lord, in whose body all transformations were manifest.**

===== Purport =====

The ecstatic transformations of the body as described in such exalted scriptures as the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// are practically not seen in this material world. However, these symptoms were perfectly present in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. These symptoms are indicative of //mahābhāva,// or the highest ecstasy. Sometimes //sahajiyās// artificially imitate these symptoms, but experienced devotees reject them immediately. The author admits herein that these symptoms are not to be found anywhere but in the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
