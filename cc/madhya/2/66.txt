===== Purport =====

The word //unmāda// is explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// as extreme joy, misfortune and bewilderment in the heart due to separation. Symptoms of //unmāda// are laughing like a madman, dancing, singing, performing ineffectual activities, talking nonsense, running, shouting and sometimes working in contradictory ways. The word //praṇaya// is explained thus: When there is a possibility of receiving direct honor but it is avoided, that love is called //praṇaya.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in his //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi,// explains the word //māna// thus: When the lover feels novel sweetness by exchanging hearty loving words but wishes to hide his feelings by crooked means, //māna// is experienced.
