In this Second Chapter, the activities of Lord Caitanya that took place after the Lord accepted //sannyāsa// are generally described. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is specifically mentioned here as being //gaura,// or of fair complexion. Kṛṣṇa is generally known to be blackish, but when He is absorbed in the thought of the //gopīs,// who are all of fair complexion, Kṛṣṇa Himself also becomes fair. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in particular felt separation from Kṛṣṇa very deeply, exactly like a lover who is dejected in separation from the beloved. Such feelings, which were expressed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu for nearly twelve years at the end of His pastimes, are described in brief in this Second Chapter of the //Madhya-līlā.//
