In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// the word //dainya// (humility) is explained as follows: "When unhappiness, fearfulness and the sense of having offended combine, one feels condemned. This sense of condemnation is described as //dīnatā,// humility. When one is subjected to such humility, he feels physically inactive, he apologizes, and his consciousness is disturbed. His mind is also restless, and many other symptoms are visible."1. \\

(1) The word //nirveda// is also explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:// "One may feel unhappiness and separation, as well as jealousy and lamentation, due to not discharging one's duties. The despondency that results is called //nirveda.// When one is captured by this despondency, thoughts, tears, loss of bodily luster, humility and heavy breathing result." //Viṣāda// is also explained in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:// "When one fails to achieve his desired goal of life and repents for all his offenses, there is a state of regret called //viṣāda.//" The symptoms of //avasāda// are also explained: "One hankers to revive his original condition and inquires how to do so. There are also deep thought, heavy breathing, crying and lamentation, as well as a changing of the bodily color and drying up of the tongue."

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// thirty-three such destructive symptoms are mentioned. They are expressed in words, in the eyebrows and in the eyes. These symptoms are called //vyabhicārī bhāva,// destructive ecstasy. If they continue, they are sometimes called //sañcārī,// or continued ecstasy.
