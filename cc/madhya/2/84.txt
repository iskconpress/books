All the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were noted by His personal secretary Svarūpa Dāmodara and repeated to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, who memorized them. Whatever Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī heard is recorded in //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// This is called the //paramparā// system, from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to Svarūpa Dāmodara to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī to Kavirāja Gosvāmī. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has distributed this information in his book //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// In other words, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is the essence of the instruction given through the //paramparā// system of the disciplic succession stemming from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
