===== Purport =====

According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, there are three kinds of devotees, known as //bhajana-vijña// (experts in devotional service), //bhajana-śīla// (devotees engaged in devotional service), and //kṛṣṇa-nāme dīkṣita kṛṣṇa-nāma-kārī// (initiated devotees engaged in chanting). The author of //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// begs the mercy of all these devotees and asks them to be pleased with him. He says, "Let the neophyte devotees---the devotees who are very expert in arguing though they have no sense of advanced devotional service, who think themselves very advanced because they imitate some //smārta-brāhmaṇa//-let such devotees not be displeased with me, thinking that I have committed errors in this regard. I beg their pardon with great humility, but I am submitting that I personally have no desire to add or subtract anything. I have only written what I have heard in the disciplic succession because I am dedicated to the lotus feet of previous //ācāryas// like Svarūpa Dāmodara, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī. I have only written what I have learned from them."
