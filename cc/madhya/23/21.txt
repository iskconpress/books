This is a verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:19:15|(1.19.15)]] spoken by Mahārāja Parīkṣit while he was sitting on the bank of the Ganges expecting to be bitten by a snakebird summoned by the curse of a //brāhmaṇa// boy named Śṛṅgi, who was the son of a great sage named Śamīka. News of the curse was conveyed to the King, who prepared for his imminent death. Many great saintly persons, sages, //brāhmaṇas,// kings and demigods came to see him in his last days. Mahārāja Parīkṣit, however, was not at all afraid of being bitten by the snake-bird. Indeed, he requested all the great personalities assembled to continue chanting the holy name of Lord Viṣṇu.
