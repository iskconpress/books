Nirveda, harṣa, and other symptoms are explained in //Madhya-līlā// (14.167). The transitory elements (//vyabhicārī//) are described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// as follows:

> athocyante trayas triṁśad-
> bhāvā ye vyabhicāriṇaḥ
> viśeṣeṇābhimukhyena
> caranti sthāyinaṁ prati
> vāg-aṅga-sattva-sūcyā ye
> jñeyās te vyabhicāriṇaḥ
>
> sañcārayanti bhāvasya
> gatiṁ sañcāriṇo 'pi te
> unmajjanti nimajjanti
> stāyiny-amṛta-vāridhau
> ūrmivad vardhayanty enaṁ
> yānti tad-rūpatāṁ ca te

There are thirty-three transitory elements known as //vyabhicārī//-ecstatic emotions. They especially wander about the permanent sentiments as assistants. They are to be known by words, by different symptoms seen in the limbs and in other parts of the body, and by the peculiar conditions of the heart. Because they set in motion the progress of the permanent sentiments, they are specifically called //sañcārī,// or impelling principles. These impelling principles rise up and fall back in the permanent sentiments of ecstatic love like waves in an ocean of ecstasy. Consequently they are called //vyabhicāri.//
