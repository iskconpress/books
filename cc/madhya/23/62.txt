//Vipralambha// is described in the //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi://

> yūnor ayuktayor bhāvo
> yuktayor vātha yo mithaḥ
> abhīṣṭāliṅganādīnām
> anavāptau prakṛṣyate
> sa vipralambho vijñeyaḥ
> sambhogonnatikārakaḥ
>
> na vinā vipralambhena
> sambhogaḥ puṣṭim aśnute

When the lover and the beloved meet, they are called //yukta// (connected). Previous to their meeting, they are called //ayukta// (not connected). Whether connected or not connected, the ecstatic emotion arising due to not being able to embrace and kiss each other as desired is called //vipralambha.// This //vipralambha// helps nourish emotions at the time of meeting. Similarly, //sambhoga// is thus described:

> darśanāliṅganādīnām
> ānukūlyān niṣevayā
> yūnor ullāsam ārohan
> bhāvaḥ sambhoga īryate

"Meeting each other and embracing each other are aimed at bringing about the happiness of both the lover and the beloved. When this stage becomes increasingly jubilant, the resultant ecstatic emotion is called //sambhoga.//" hen awakened, //sambhoga// is divided into four categories:

(1) //pūrva-rāga-anantara-//after //pūrva-rāga// (attachment prior to meeting), //sambhoga// is called brief (//saṅkṣipta//);

(2) //māna-anantara-//after //māna// (anger based on love), //sambhoga// is called encroached (//saṅkīrṇa//);

(3) //kiñcid-dūra-pravāsa-anantara-//after being a little distance away for some time, //sambhoga// is called accomplished (//sampanna//);

(4) //sudūra-pravāsa-anantara-//after being far away, //sambhoga// is called perfection (//samṛddhimān//).

The meetings of the lovers that take place in dreams also have these four divisions.
