In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, rati// (attraction) is thus described:

> vyaktaṁ masṛṇitevāntar-
> lakṣyate rati-lakṣaṇam
> mumukṣu-prabhṛtīnaṁ ced
> bhaved eṣā ratir na hi
>
> kintu bāla-camatkāra-
> kārī tac-cihna-vīkṣayā
> abhijñena subodho 'yaṁ
> raty-ābhāsaḥ prakīrtitaḥ

The real symptoms of the fructification of the seed of love (//rati//) are manifest because the heart is melted. When such symptoms are found among speculators and fruitive actors, they cannot be accepted as real symptoms of attachment. Foolish people without knowledge of devotional service praise such symptoms of attachment even when they are based on something other than a desire to serve Kṛṣṇa. However, one who is expert in devotional service calls such symptoms //rati-ābhāsa,// a mere glimpse of attachment.
