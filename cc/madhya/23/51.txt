===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, vibhāva// is described as follows:

> tatra jñeyā vibhāvās tu
> raty-āsvādana-hetavaḥ
> te dvidhālambanā eke
> tathaivoddīpanāḥ pare

"The cause bringing about the tasting of love for Kṛṣṇa is called //vibhāva. Vibhāva// is divided into two categories---//ālambana// (support) and //uddīpana// (awakening)."

In the //Agni Purāṇa// it is stated:

> vibhāvyate hi raty-ādir
> yatra yena vibhāvyate
> vibhāvo nāma sa dvedhā-
> lambanoddīpanātmakaḥ

"That which causes love for Kṛṣṇa to appear is called //vibhāva.// That has two divisions---//ālambana// [in which love appears] and //uddīpana// [by which love appears]."

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// the following is stated about //ālambana://

> kṛṣṇaś ca kṛṣṇa-bhaktāś ca
> budhair ālambanā matāḥ
> raty-āder viṣayatvena
> tathādhāratayāpi ca

"The object of love is Kṛṣṇa, and the container of that love is the devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Both of them are called by the learned scholars //ālambana//---the foundations." Similarly, //uddīpana// is described:

> uddīpanās tu te proktā
> bhāvam uddīpayanti ye

"Those things which awaken ecstatic love are called //uddīpana.//"

> te tu śrī-kṛṣṇa-candrasya
> guṇāś ceṣṭāḥ prasādhanam

Mainly this awakening is made possible by the qualities and activities of Kṛṣṇa, as well as by His mode of decoration and the way His hair is arranged.

> smitāṅga-saurabhe vaṁśa-
> śṛṅga-nūpura-kambavaḥ
> padāṅka-kṣetra-tulasī-
> bhakta-tad-vāsarādayaḥ

"Kṛṣṇa's smile, the fragrance of His transcendental body, His flute, bugle, ankle bells, conchshell, the marks on His feet, His place of residence, His favorite plant [//tulasī//], His devotees, and the observance of fasts and vows connected to His devotion all awaken the symptoms of ecstatic love."

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, anubhāva// is described as follows:

> anubhāvās tu citta-stha-
> bhāvānām avabodhakāḥ
> te bahir vikriyā prāyāḥ
> proktā udbhāsvarākhyayā

The many external ecstatic symptoms or bodily transformations which indicate ecstatic emotions in the mind, and which are also called //udbhāsvara,// are the //anubhāvas,// or subordinate ecstatic expressions of love. Some of these are dancing, falling down and rolling on the ground, singing and crying very loudly, bodily contortions, loud vibrations, yawning, deep breathing, disregard for others, the frothing of saliva, mad laughter, spitting, hiccups and other similar symptoms. All these symptoms are divided into two divisions-//śīta// and //kṣepaṇa.// Singing, yawning and so on are called //śīta.// Dancing and bodily contortions are called //kṣepaṇa.//

The //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// describes //udbhāsvara// as follows:

> udbhāsante svadhāmnīti
> proktā udbhāsvarā budhaiḥ
> nīvyuttarīya-dhammilla-
> sraṁsanaṁ gātra-moṭanam
> jṛmbhā ghrāṇasya phullatvaṁ
> niśvāsādyāś ca te matāḥ

The ecstatic symptoms manifest in the external body of a person in ecstatic love are called by learned scholars //udbhāsvara.// Some of these are a slackening of the belt and a dropping of clothes and hair. Others are bodily contortions, yawning, a trembling of the front portion of the nostrils, heavy breathing, hiccupping and falling down and rolling on the ground. These are the external manifestations of emotional love. //Stambha// and other symptoms are described in //Madhya-līlā// (14.167).
