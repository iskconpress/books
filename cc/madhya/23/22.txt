**PUPORT**

Mahārāja Parīkṣit's expression of anxiety is explained in this verse. He says, "Let whatever is destined to happen take place. It doesn't matter. Just let me see that not a moment of my time is wasted without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa." One has to tolerate all obstacles on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and one has to see that not a moment of his life is wasted outside of Kṛṣṇa's service.
