===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, sthāyi-bhāva,// permanent ecstasy, is thus described:

> aviruddhān viruddhāṁś ca
> bhāvān yo vaśatāṁ nayan
> su-rājeva virājeta
> sa sthāyī bhāva ucyate
> sthāyī bhāvo 'tra sa proktaḥ
> śrī-kṛṣṇa-viṣayā ratiḥ

These moods (//bhāvas//) bring under control the favorable ecstasies (such as laughing) and unfavorable ecstasies (such as anger). When these continue to remain as kings, they are called //sthāyi-bhāva,// or permanent ecstasies. Continuous ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa is called permanent ecstasy.
