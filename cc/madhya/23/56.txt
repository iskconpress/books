**"There are two divisions of each of the five mellows-yoga [connection] and viyoga [separation]. Among the mellows of friendship and parental affection, there are many divisions of connection and separation.**

===== Purport =====

In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// these divisions are described:

> ayoga-yogāvetasya
> prabhedau kathitāv ubhau

In the mellows of //bhakti-yoga,// there are two stages-//ayoga// and //yoga. Ayoga// is described in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu://

> saṅgābhāvo harer dhīrair
> ayoga iti kathyate
> ayoge tvan-manaskatvaṁ
> tad-guṇādy-anusandhayaḥ
> tat-prāpty-upāya-cintādyāḥ
> sarveṣāṁ kathitāḥ kriyāḥ

Learned scholars in the science of //bhakti-yoga// say that when there is an absence of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, separation takes place. In the stage of //ayoga// (separation), the mind is filled with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. In that stage, the devotee searches out the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said that in that stage of separation, all the devotees in the different mellows are always active in thinking of ways to attain Kṛṣṇa's association.

The word //yoga// (connection) is thus described:

> kṛṣṇena saṅgamo yas tu
> sa yoga iti kīrtyate

"When one meets Kṛṣṇa directly, that is called //yoga."//

In the transcendental mellows of neutrality and servitorship, there are similar divisions of //yoga// and //viyoga,// but they are not variegated. The divisions of //yoga// and //viyoga// are always existing in the five mellows. However, in the transcendental mellows of friendship and paternal affection, there are many varieties of //yoga// and //viyoga.// The varieties of //yoga// are thus described:

> yogo 'pi kathitaḥ siddhis
> tuṣṭiḥ sthitir iti tridhā

Yoga (connection) is of three types-success, satisfaction and permanence. The divisions of //ayoga// (separation) are thus described:

> utkaṇṭhitaṁ viyogaś cety
> ayogo 'pi dvidhocyate

Thus //ayoga// has two divisions-longing and separation.
