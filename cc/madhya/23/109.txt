===== Purport =====

The word //anapekṣaḥ// means that one should not be concerned with mundane people and should not depend upon them. One should depend solely on the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be free from material desires. One should also be clean, within and without. To be outwardly clean, one should regularly bathe with soap and oil, and to be inwardly clean one should always be absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. The words //sarvārambha-parityāgī// indicate that one should not be interested in the so-called //smārta-vidhi// of pious and impious activities.
