===== Purport =====

One should not be jealous of members of other castes or nations. It is not that only Indians or //brāhmaṇas// can become Vaiṣṇavas. Anyone can become a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore one should recognize that the //bhakti// cult must be spread all over the world. That is real //adveṣṭā.// Moreover, the word //maitraḥ,// friendly, indicates that one who is able to preach the //bhakti// cult all over the world should be equally friendly to everyone. These two and the following six verses were spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā// (12.13-20).
