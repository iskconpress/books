In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// the following definition is given:

> athāsyāḥ keśava-rater
> lakṣitāyā nigadyate
> sāmagrī-paripoṣena
> paramā rasa-rūpatā
>
> vibhāvair anubhāvaiś ca
> sāttvikair vyabhicāribhiḥ
> svādyatvaṁ hṛdi bhaktānām
> ānītā śravaṇādibhiḥ
> eṣā kṛṣṇa-ratiḥ sthāyī
> bhāvo bhakti-raso bhavet

Love for Kṛṣṇa, Keśava, as previously described, reaches the supreme state of being composed of mellows when its ingredients are fulfilled. By means of //vibhāva, anubhāva, sāttvika// and //vyabhicārī,// hearing and chanting are activated, and the devotee is able to taste love for Kṛṣṇa. Then attachment for Kṛṣṇa, or permanent ecstasy (//sthāyi-bhāva//), becomes the mellow of devotional service (//bhakti-rasa//).
