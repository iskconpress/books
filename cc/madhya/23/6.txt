**"Bhāva [emotion] has two different symptoms-constitutional and marginal. Now, My dear Sanātana, listen to the symptoms of love.**

===== Purport =====

The word //śuddha-sattva-viśeṣātmā// means "situated on the transcendental platform of pure goodness." In this way the soul is purified of all material contamination, and this position is called //svarūpa-lakṣaṇa,// the constitutional symptom of //bhāva,// emotion. By various tastes, one's heart is softened, and there is an awakening of one's loving propensity to render spontaneous service to the Lord. This is called //taṭastha-lakṣaṇa,// the marginal symptom of //bhāva.//
