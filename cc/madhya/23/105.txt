This is the technique for understanding //śuṣka-vairāgya// and //yukta-vairāgya.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:17|(Bg. 6.17)]] it is said:

> yuktāhāra-vihārasya
> yukta-ceṣṭasya karmasu
> yukta-svapnāvabodhaśya
> yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā

"He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the //yoga// system." To broadcast the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to learn the possibility of renunciation in terms of country, time and candidate. A candidate for Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries should be taught about the renunciation of material existence, but one would teach candidates from a country like India in a different way. The teacher (//ācārya//) has to consider time, candidate and country. He must avoid the principle of //niyamāgraha---//that is, he should not try to perform the impossible. What is possible in one country may not be possible in another. The //ācārya's// duty is to accept the essence of devotional service. There may be a little change here and there as far as //yukta-vairāgya// (proper renunciation) is concerned. Dry renunciation is forbidden by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and we have also learned this from our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Gosvāmī Mahārāja. The essence of devotional service must be taken into consideration, and not the outward paraphernalia.

Sanātana Gosvāmī wrote his Vaiṣṇava //smṛti, Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// which was specifically meant for India. In those days, India was more or less following the principle of //smārta-vidhi.// Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī had to keep pace with this, and his //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// was compiled with this in mind. According to //smārta-brāhmaṇas,// a person not born in a //brāhmaṇa// family could not be elevated to the position of a //brāhmaṇa.// Sanātana Gosvāmī, however, says in //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// (2.12) that anyone can be elevated to the position of a //brāhmaṇa// by the process of initiation.

> yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti
> kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ
> tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena
> dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām

There is a difference between the //smārta// process and the //gosvāmī// process. According to the //smārta// process, one cannot be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa// unless he is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family. According to the //gosvāmī// process, the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// and the //Nārada-pañcarātra,// anyone can be a //brāhmaṇa// if he is properly initiated by a bona fide spiritual master. This is also the verdict of Śukadeva Gosvāmī in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:4:18|(2.4.18)]]:

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ

A Vaiṣṇava is immediately purified, provided he follows the rules and regulations of his bona fide spiritual master. It is not necessary that the rules and regulations followed in India be exactly the same as those in Europe, America and other Western countries. Simply imitating without effect is called //niyamāgraha.// Not following the regulative principles but instead living extravagantly is also called //niyamāgraha.// The word //niyama// means "regulative principles," and //āgraha// means "eagerness." The word //agraha// means "not to accept." We should not follow regulative principles without an effect, nor should we fail to accept the regulative principles. What is required is a special technique according to country, time and candidate. Without the sanction of the spiritual master, we should not try to imitate. This principle is recommended here: //śuṣka-vairāgya-jñāna saba niṣedhila.// This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's liberal demonstration of the //bhakti// cult. We should not introduce anything whimsically, without the sanction of the bona fide spiritual master. In this connection, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments on these points by quoting two verses by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.255-256).

> anāsaktasya viṣayān
> yathārham upayuñjataḥ
> nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe
> yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate
>
> prāpañcikatayā buddhyā
> hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ
> mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo
> vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate

"When one is not attached to anything but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Kṛṣṇa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Kṛṣṇa is not as complete in his renunciation." To preach the //bhakti// cult, one should seriously consider these verses.
