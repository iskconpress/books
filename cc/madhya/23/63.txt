===== Translation =====

**"Vipralambha has four divisions-pūrva-rāga, māna, pravāsa, and prema-vaicittya.**

===== Purport =====

//Pūrva-rāga// is described in //Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi://

> ratir yā saṅgamāt pūrvaṁ
> darśana-śravaṇādi-jā
> tayor unmīlati prājñaiḥ
> pūrva-rāgaḥ sa ucyate

When attachment produced in both the lover and beloved before their meeting by seeing, hearing and so on becomes very palatable by the mixture of four ingredients, such as //vibhāva// and //anubhāva,// this is called //pūrva-rāga.//

The word //māna// is also described:

> dampatyor bhāva ekatra
> sator apy anuraktayoḥ
> svābhīṣṭāśleṣa-vīkṣādi-
> nirodhī māna ucyate

Māna is a word used to indicate the mood of the lover and the beloved experienced whether they are in one place or in different places. This mood obstructs their looking at one another and embracing one another, despite the fact that they are attached to one another.

Pravāsa is also explained as follows:

> pūrva-saṅga-tayor yūnor
> bhaved deśāntarādibhiḥ
> vyavadhānaṁ tu yat prājñaiḥ
> sa pravāsa itīryate

Pravāsa is a word used to indicate the separation of lovers who were previously intimately associated. This separation is due to their being in different places.

Similarly, //prema-vaicittya// is explained:

> priyasya sannikarṣe 'pi
> premotkarṣa-svabhāvataḥ
> yā viśeṣa-dhiyārtis tat
> prema-vaicittyam ucyate

Prema-vaicittya is a word used to indicate an abundance of love that brings about grief from fear of separation, although the lover is present.
