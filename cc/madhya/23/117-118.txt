**Illusory stories opposed to the conclusions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness concern the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, the story that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma arise from a black hair and a white hair of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and the story about the kidnapping of the queens. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained to Sanātana Gosvāmī the proper conclusions of these stories.**

Due to envy, many //asuras// describe Kṛṣṇa to be like a black crow or an incarnation of a hair. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told Sanātana Gosvāmī how to counteract all these asuric explanations of Kṛṣṇa. The word //kāka// means crow, and //keśa// means hair. The //asuras// describe Kṛṣṇa as an incarnation of a crow, an incarnation of a //śūdra// (a blackish tribe) and an incarnation of a hair, not knowing that the word //keśa// means //ka-īśa// and that //ka// means Lord Brahmā and //īśa// means Lord. Thus Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of Lord Brahmā.

Some of Lord Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are mentioned in the //Mahābhārata// as //mauṣala-līlā.// These include the stories of the destruction of the Yadu dynasty, Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, His being pierced by a hunter's arrow, the story of Kṛṣṇa's being an incarnation of a piece of hair (//keśa-avatāra//) as well as //mahiṣī-haraṇa,// the kidnapping of Kṛṣṇa's queens. Actually these are not factual but are related for the bewilderment of the //asuras// who want to prove that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary human being. They are false in the sense that these pastimes are not eternal, nor are they transcendental or spiritual. There are many people who are by nature averse to the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Such people are called //asuras.// They have mistaken ideas about Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the //asuras// are given a chance to forget Kṛṣṇa more and more, birth after birth. Thus they make their appearance in a family of //asuras// and continue this process, being kept in bewilderment about Kṛṣṇa. //Asuras// in the dress of //sannyāsīs// even explain //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in different ways according to their own imaginations. Thus they continue to remain //asuras// birth after birth.

As far as the //keśa-avatāra// (incarnation of hair) is concerned, it is mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:7:26|(2.7.26)]]. The //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// also states: //ujjahārātmanaḥ keśau sita-kṛṣṇau mahā-bala.//

Similarly, in the //Mahābhārata://

> sa cāpi keśau harir uccakarta
> ekaṁ śuklam aparam cāpi kṛṣṇam
> tau cāpi keśāvāv iśatāṁ yadūnāṁ
> kule striyau rohiṇīṁ devakīṁ ca
>
> tayor eko balabhadro babhūva
> yo 'sau śvetas tasya devasya keśaḥ
> kṛṣṇo dvitīyaḥ keśavaḥ saṁbabhūva
> keśaḥ yo 'sau varṇataḥ kṛṣṇa uktaḥ

Thus in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Viṣṇu Purāṇa// and //Mahābhārata// there are references to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma being incarnations of a black hair and a white hair. It is stated that Lord Viṣṇu snatched two hairs-one white and one black-from His head. These two hairs entered the wombs of Rohiṇī and Devakī, members of the Yadu dynasty. Balarāma was born from Rohiṇī, and Kṛṣṇa was born of Devakī. Thus Balarāma appeared from the first hair, and Kṛṣṇa appeared from the second hair. It was also foretold that all the //asuras,// who are enemies of the demigods, would be cut down by Lord Viṣṇu by His white and black plenary expansions and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead would appear and perform wonderful activities. In this connection, one should see //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta,// the chapter called //Kṛṣṇāmṛta,// verses 156-164. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has refuted this argument about the hair incarnation, and his refutation is supported by Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa's commentaries. This matter is further discussed in the //Kṛṣṇa-sandarbha// (29) and in the commentary known as //Sarva-saṁvādinī,// by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī.
