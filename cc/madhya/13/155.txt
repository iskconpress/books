===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa has two kinds of presence-//prakaṭa// and //aprakaṭa,// manifest and unmanifest. Both are identical to the sincere devotee. Even if Kṛṣṇa is not physically present, the devotee's absorption in the affairs of Kṛṣṇa makes Him present. This is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.38):

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

Due to his intense love, the pure devotee always sees Lord Kṛṣṇa present within his heart. All glories to Govinda, the primeval Personality of Godhead! When Kṛṣṇa is not manifest before the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they are always absorbed in thoughts of Him. Therefore even though Kṛṣṇa was living at that time at Dvārakā, He was simultaneously present before all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. This was His //aprakaṭa// presence. Devotees who are always absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa will soon see Kṛṣṇa face to face without a doubt. Devotees who are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are fully absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa certainly return home, back to Godhead. They then see Kṛṣṇa directly, face to face, take //prasāda// with Him and enjoy His company. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā:tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]].

During his lifetime, a pure devotee is always speaking of Kṛṣṇa and engaging in His service, and as soon as he gives up his body, he immediately returns to Goloka Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa is personally present. He then meets Kṛṣṇa directly. This is successful human life. This is the meaning of //prakaṭeha ānibe satvara.// The pure devotee will soon see the personal manifestation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
