===== Purport =====

The word //dayitā// refers to one who has received the mercy of the Lord. Lord Jagannātha has a number of stalwart servants known as //dayitās.// These servants do not come from very high-caste families (//brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// or //vaiśyas//), but because they are engaged in the service of the Lord, they have been elevated to a respected position. Thus they are known as //dayitās.// These servants of Lord Jagannātha take care of the Lord from the day of the Snāna-yātrā up to the time the Lord is carried from the throne to the Ratha car. In the //Kṣetra-māhātmya// these //dayitās// are said to come from the //śabaras,// a caste that keeps and sells pigs. However, among the //dayitās// there are also many who come from the //brāhmaṇa// caste. Those //dayitās// coming from the //brāhmaṇa// families are called //dayitā-patis,// or leaders of the //dayitās. The dayitā-patis// offer food such as sweetmeats to Lord Jagannātha during the //anavasara,// the resting period after Snāna-yātrā. They also make the early morning offering of sweetmeats daily, It is said that during the //anavasara// Lord Jagannātha suffers from fever and that the //dayitā-patis// offer Him an infusion of drugs represented by fruit juice. It is said that in the beginning Lord Jagannātha was worshiped by the //śabaras// and was known as the Deity Nīla Mādhava. Later, when the Deity was established in the temple, the Lord became known as Jagannātha. Because the Deities were taken from the //śabaras,// all the //śabara// devotees were elevated to the position of //dayitās.//
