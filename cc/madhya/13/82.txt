===== Translation =====

**When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu danced and jumped high, roaring like thunder and moving in a circle like a wheel, He appeared like a circling firebrand.**

===== Purport =====

If a burning cinder of a firebrand is whirled about very swiftly, it gives the appearance of a circle of fire. This is called //alāta-ākāra,// or a firebrand circle. This whole circle is not actually made of fire but is a single fire in motion. Similarly, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is a single personality, but when He danced and jumped high in a circle, He appeared like the //alāta-cakra.//
