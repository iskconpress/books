Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura explains this point. Is this //bhāgya// (fortune) the result of an accident or something else? In the scriptures, devotional service and pious activity are considered fortunate. Pious activities can be divided into three categories-pious activities that awaken one's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness are called //bhakty-unmukhī sukṛti.// Pious activities that bestow material opulence are called //bhogonmukhī,// and pious activities that enable the living entity to merge into the existence of the Supreme are called //mokṣonmukhī.// These last two awards of pious activity are not actually fortunate. Pious activities are fortunate when they help one become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The good fortune of //bhakty-unmukhī// is attainable only when one comes in contact with a devotee. By associating with a devotee willingly or unwillingly, one advances in devotional service, and thus one's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness is awakened.
