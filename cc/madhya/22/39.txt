===== Purport =====

Those who are interested in material enjoyment are known as //bhukti.// One who is interested in merging into the effulgence of Brahman or perfecting the mystic //yoga// system is not a devotee at all. Devotees do not have such desires. However, if a //karmī, jñānī// or //yogī// somehow contacts a devotee and renders devotional service, Kṛṣṇa immediately awards him love of God and gives him shelter at His lotus feet, although he may have no idea how to develop love of Kṛṣṇa. If a person wants material profit from devotional service, Kṛṣṇa condemns such materialistic desires. To desire material opulence while engaging in devotional service is foolish. Although the person may be foolish, Kṛṣṇa, being all-intelligent, engages him in His devotional service in such a way that he gradually forgets material opulence. The point is that we should not try to exchange loving service for material prosperity. If we are actually surrendered to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, our only desire should be to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Surrender does not mean that we demand something from the Lord but that we completely depend on His mercy.
