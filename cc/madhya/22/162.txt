My weapon, the disc of time, never vanquishes those for whom I am very dear, for whom I am the Supersoul, the son, friend, spiritual master, well-wisher, worshipable Deity and desired goal. Since the devotees are always attached to Me, they are never vanquished by the agents of time.'}}

This was spoken by Kapiladeva to His mother Devahūti and is recorded in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:3:25:38|(3.25.38)]]. Kapiladeva instructed His mother in //sāṅkhya-yoga,// but the importance of //bhakti-yoga// is mentioned here. Later //sāṅhkya-yoga// was imitated by atheists, whose system was founded by a different Kapiladeva, Ṛṣi Kapiladeva.
