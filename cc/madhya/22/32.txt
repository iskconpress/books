{{description>" 'The external illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa, known as māyā, is always ashamed to stand in front of Kṛṣṇa, just as darkness is ashamed to remain before the sunshine. However, that māyā bewilders unfortunate people who have no intelligence. Thus they simply boast that this material world is theirs and that they are its enjoyers.'}}

The entire world is bewildered because people are thinking, "This is my land," "America is mine," "India is mine." Not knowing the real value of life, people think that the material body and the land where it is produced are all in all. This is the basic principle behind nationalism, socialism and communism. Such thinking, which simply bewilders the living being, is nothing but rascalism. It is due to the darkness of //māyā,// but as soon as one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately relieved from such misconceptions. This verse is quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:5:13|(2.5.13)]]. There is also another appropriate verse in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:7:47|(2.7.47)]]:

> śaśvat praśāntam abhayaṁ pratibodha-mātraṁ
> śuddhaṁ samaṁ sad-asataḥ paramātma-tattvam
> śabdo na yatra puru-kārakavān kriyārtho
> māyā paraity abhimukhe ca vilajjamānā
> tad vai padaṁ bhagavataḥ paramasya puṁso
> brahmeti yad vidur ajasra-sukhaṁ viśokam

"What is realized as the Absolute Brahman is full of unlimited bliss without grief. That is certainly the ultimate phase of the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead. He is eternally void of all disturbances, fearless, completely conscious as opposed to matter, uncontaminated and without distinctions. He is the principal, primeval cause of all causes and effects, in whom there is no sacrifice for fruitive activities and in whom the illusory energy does not stand."

This verse was spoken by Lord Brahmā when he was questioned by the great sage Nārada. Nārada was surprised to see the creator of the universe meditating, for he was doubting whether there was someone greater than Lord Brahmā. While answering the great sage Nārada, Lord Brahmā described the position of //māyā// and the bewildered living entities. This verse was spoken in that connection.
