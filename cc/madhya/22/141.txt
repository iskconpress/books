It is said:

> adhyāpanaṁ brahma-yajñaḥ
> pitṛ-yajñas tu tarpaṇam
> homo daivo balir bhauto
> nṛ-yajño 'tithi-pūjanam

"By performing oblations with ghee, the demigods are satisfied. By studying the //Vedas, brahma-yajña// is performed, and by this the great sages are satisfied. Offering libations of water before one's forefathers is called //pitṛ-yajña.// By offering tribute, //bhūta-yajña// is performed. By properly receiving guests, //nṛ-yajña// is performed." There are five //yajñas// and five kinds of indebtedness-indebtedness to the demigods, great sages, forefathers, living entities and common men. Therefore one has to perform five kinds of //yajñas,// but when one takes to //saṅkīrtana-yajña// (the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra//) one doesn't have to perform any other //yajña.// In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Nārada Muni made a statement about the systematic performance of //bhāgavata-dharma// in connection with statements previously made by the nine Yogendras before Mahārāja Nimi. The sage Karabhājana Ṛṣi explained the four incarnations of the four //yugas,// and at the end, in this verse (text 141), he explained the position of Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee and how he is absolved of all debts.
