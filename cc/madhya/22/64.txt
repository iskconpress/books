The word //śraddhāvān// (faithful) means understanding Kṛṣṇa to be the //summum bonum,// the eternal truth and absolute transcendence. If one has full faith in Kṛṣṇa and confidence in Him, one becomes eligible to discharge devotional service confidentially. According to one's faith, one is a topmost, intermediate or inferior devotee.
