The words //sajātīyāśaye snigdhe sādhau saṅgaḥ svato vare// are very important items. One should not associate with professional //Bhāgavatam// reciters. A professional //Bhāgavatam// reciter is one who is not in the disciplic succession or one who has no taste for //bhakti-yoga.// Simply on the strength of grammatical knowledge and word jugglery, professional reciters maintain their bodies and their desires for sense gratification by reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// One should also avoid those who are averse to Lord Viṣṇu and His devotees, those who are Māyāvādīs, those who offend the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// those who simply dress as Vaiṣṇavas or so-called //gosvāmīs,// and those who make a business by selling Vedic //mantras// and reciting //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to maintain their families. One should not try to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from such materialistic people. According to the Vedic injunctions: //yasya deve parā bhaktiḥ. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// can only be recited by one who has unflinching faith in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and His devotee, the spiritual master. One should try to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from the spiritual master. The Vedic injunction states: //bhaktyā bhāgavataṁ grāhyaṁ na buddhyā na ca ṭīkayā.// One has to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// through the process of devotional service and by hearing the recitation of a pure devotee. These are the injunctions of Vedic literature-//śruti// and //smṛti.// Those who are not in the disciplic succession and who are not pure devotees cannot understand the real mysterious objective of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.//
