Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura points out that there are thirty-five items up to the point of observing special vows in the month of Kārttika. To these thirty-five items, another four are added-namely marking //tilaka// on different parts of the body, writing the names of the Lord all over the body, accepting the Deity's garland and accepting //caraṇāmṛta.// These four items are understood to be included by Kavirāja Gosvāmī within //arcana,// worship of the Deity. Although these items are not mentioned here, they are to be added to the previous thirty-five items. Thus the total number becomes thirty-nine. To these thirty-nine should be added five others: association with devotees, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// regularly, residing in Mathurā, the birthplace of Kṛṣṇa, and worshiping the Deity with great respect and veneration. The thirty-nine items plus these five come to a total of forty-four. If we add the previous twenty items to these forty-four, the total number becomes sixty-four. The five items mentioned above repeat previously mentioned items. In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states:

> aṅgānāṁ pañcakasyāsya
> pūrva-vilikhitasya ca
> nikhila-śraiṣṭhya-bodhāya
> punar apy atra śaṁsanam

"The glorification of these five items [association with devotees, chanting the holy name and so on] is to make known the complete superiority of these five practices of devotional service.

The sixty-four items of devotional service include all the activities of the body, mind and senses. Thus the sixty-four items engage one in devotional service in all respects.
