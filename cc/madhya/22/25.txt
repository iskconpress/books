===== Purport =====

It is a fact that every living entity is eternally a servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is forgotten due to the influence of //māyā,// which induces one to believe in material happiness. Being illusioned by //māyā,// one thinks that material happiness is the only desirable object. This material consciousness is like a chain around the neck of the conditioned soul. As long as he is bound to that conception, he cannot get out of //māyā's// clutches. However, if by Kṛṣṇa's mercy he gets in touch with a bona fide spiritual master, abides by his order and serves him, engaging other conditioned souls in the Lord's service, he then attains liberation and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa's shelter.
