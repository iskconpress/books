===== Purport =====

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:9:34|(2.9.34)]] it is stated:

> ṛte 'rthaṁ yat pratīyeta
> na pratīyeta cātmani
> tad vidyād ātmano māyāṁ
> yathābhāso yathā tamaḥ

Wherever there is light, there cannot be darkness. When a living entity becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately relieved of all material lusty desires. Lusty desires and greed are associated with //rajas// and //tamas,// darkness and passion. When one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, the modes of darkness and passion immediately vanish, and the remaining mode, //sattva-guṇa// (goodness), remains. When one is situated in the mode of goodness, he can make spiritual advancement and understand things clearly. This position is not possible for everyone. When a person is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he continuously hears about Kṛṣṇa, thinks about Him, worships Him and serves Him as a devotee. If he remains in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this way, the darkness of //māyā// certainly will not be able to touch him.
