===== Purport =====

The path of devotional service is always independent of other activity. The path of speculative knowledge or mystic //yoga// may be a little beneficial in the beginning, but it cannot be considered part of devotional service. This verse (//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// 11.20.31) was spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa when He was speaking to Uddhava before His departure from this material world. These are important instructions given directly by Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Uddhava asked the Lord about the two kinds of instructions given in the //Vedas.// One instruction is called //pravṛtti-mārga,// and the other is called //nivṛtti-mārga.// These are directions for enjoying the material world according to regulative principles and then giving up the material world for higher spiritual understanding. Sometimes one does not know whether to practice speculative knowledge or mystic //yoga// for advancement in spiritual knowledge. Kṛṣṇa explains to Uddhava that the mechanical process of speculative knowledge and //yoga// is not necessary for advancing in devotional service. Devotional service is completely spiritual; it has nothing to do with material things. It is awakened by hearing and chanting in the association of devotees. Because devotional service is always transcendental, it has nothing to do with material activity.
