{{description>"The followers of the varṇāśrama institution accept the regulative principles of the four social orders [brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra] and four spiritual orders [brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa]. However, if one carries out the regulative principles of these orders but does not render transcendental service to Kṛṣṇa, he falls into the hellish condition of material life.}}

===== Translation =====

**"The followers of the varṇāśrama institution accept the regulative principles of the four social orders [brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra] and four spiritual orders [brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa].

===== Purport =====

One may be a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// or one may perfectly follow the spiritual principles of //brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa,// but ultimately one falls down into a hellish condition unless one becomes a devotee. Without developing one's dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one cannot be factually elevated. The regulative principles of //varṇāśrama-dharma// in themselves are insufficient for attainment of the highest perfection. That is confirmed in the following two quotations from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.2-3).
