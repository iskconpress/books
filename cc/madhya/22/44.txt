{{description>"Because I am so fallen, I shall never get a chance to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead." This was my false apprehension. Rather, by chance a person as fallen as I am may get to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although one is being carried away by the waves of the river of time, one may eventually reach the shore.'}}
