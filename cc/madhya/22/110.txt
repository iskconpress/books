This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:1:5|(2.1.5)]]. It is one's duty to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the hearing process. This is called //śrotavyaḥ.// If one has heard properly about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his duty is to glorify the Lord and preach His glories. This is called //kīrtitavyaḥ.// When one hears about the Lord and glorifies Him, it is natural to think of Him. This is called //smartavyaḥ.// All this must be carried out if one actually wants to be immune from fear.
