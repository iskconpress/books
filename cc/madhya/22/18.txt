===== Purport =====

In Vedic scriptures, stress is sometimes given to fruitive activity, speculative knowledge and the mystic //yoga// system. Although people are inclined to practice these processes, they cannot attain the desired results without being touched by //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// devotional service. In other words, the real desired result is to invoke dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:6|(1.2.6)]] states:

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yayātmā suprasīdati

//Karma, jñāna// and //yoga// cannot actually awaken love of Godhead. One has to take to the Lord's devotional service, and the more one is inclined to devotional service, the more he loses interest in other so-called achievements. Dhruva Mahārāja went to practice mystic //yoga// to see the Lord personally face to face, but when he developed an interest in devotional service, he saw that he was not being benefited by //karma, jñāna// and //yoga.//
