This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.29.34). Kṛṣṇa was advising His most confidential servant, Uddhava, about //sambandha, abhidheya// and //prayojana.// These concern one's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the activities of that relationship, as well as the perfection of life. The Lord also described the characteristics of confidential devotees.
