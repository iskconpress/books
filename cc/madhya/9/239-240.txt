The //Brahma-saṁhitā// is a very important scripture. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu acquired the Fifth Chapter from the Ādi-keśava temple. In that Fifth Chapter, the philosophical conclusion of //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva// (simultaneous oneness and difference) is presented. The chapter also presents methods of devotional service; the eighteen-syllable Vedic hymn; discourses on the soul, the Supersoul and fruitive activity; an explanation of Kāma-gāyatrī, //kāma-bīja// and the original Mahā-Viṣṇu; and a detailed description of the spiritual world, specifically Goloka Vṛndāvana. //Brahma-saṁhitā// also explains the demigod Gaṇeśa; Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu; the origin of the Gāyatrī //mantra;// the form of Govinda and His transcendental position and abode; the living entities; the highest goal; the goddess Durgā; the meaning of austerity; the five gross elements; love of Godhead; impersonal Brahman; the initiation of Lord Brahmā; and the vision of transcendental love enabling one to see the Lord. The steps of devotional service are also explained. The mind; //yoga-nidrā;// the goddess of fortune; devotional service in spontaneous ecstasy; incarnations beginning with Lord Rāmacandra; Deities; the conditioned soul and its duties; the truth about Lord Viṣṇu; prayers; Vedic hymns; Lord Śiva; the Vedic literature; personalism and impersonalism; good behavior; and many other subjects are also discussed. There is also a description of the sun and the universal form of the Lord. All these subjects are conclusively explained in a nutshell in the //Brahma-saṁhitā.//
