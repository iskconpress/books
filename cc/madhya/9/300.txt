Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's elder brother was named Viśvarūpa. He left home before Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and accepted the //sannyāsa// order under the name of Śaṅkarāraṇya Svāmī. He traveled all over the country and finally went to Pāṇḍarapura, where he passed away after attaining perfection. In other words, he entered the spiritual world after giving up his mortal body at Pāṇḍarapura. Śrī Raṅga Purī, a disciple of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and godbrother of Īśvara Purī, disclosed this important news to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
