**Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu told the brāhmaṇa, "Indeed, you are an authority in the reading of the Bhagavad-gītā. Whatever you know constitutes the real purport of the Bhagavad-gītā."**

===== Purport =====

According to the //śāstras:bhaktyā bhāgavataṁ grāhyaṁ na buddhyā na ca ṭīkayā.// One should understand the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by hearing them from a real devotee. One cannot understand them simply by erudite scholarship or sharp intelligence. It is also said:

> gītādhītā ca yenāpi
> bhakti-bhāvena cetasā
> veda-śāstra-purāṇāni
> tenādhītāni sarvaśaḥ

To one who reads the //Bhagavad-gītā// with faith and devotion, the essence of Vedic knowledge is revealed. And according to the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// (6.23):

> yasya deve parā bhaktir
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakāśante mahātmanaḥ

All Vedic scriptures are to be understood with faith and devotion, not by mundane scholarship. We therefore present the //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.// There are many so-called scholars and philosophers who read the //Bhagavad-gītā// in a scholarly way. They simply waste their time and mislead those who read their commentaries.
