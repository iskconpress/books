**"You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself. You know the purpose of Your activities, and the person whom You enlighten can also understand Your pastimes."**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes cannot be understood by blunt material senses. One has to purify the senses by rendering transcendental loving service unto the Lord. When the Lord is pleased and reveals Himself, one can understand the transcendental form, name, qualities and pastimes of the Lord. This is confirmed in the //Kaṭha Upaniṣad// (2.23) and in the //Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// (3.2.3): //yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanūṁ svām.// "Anyone who is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can understand His transcendental name, qualities, form and pastimes."
