===== Purport =====

Śiyālī-bhairavī is located in the Tanjoreāñ district, about forty-eight miles northeast of Tanjoreāñ City. There is a very much celebrated temple of Lord Śiva there and also a very large lake. It is said that once a small boy who was a devotee of Lord Śiva came to that temple and the goddess Durgā, known as Bhairavī, gave him her breast to suck. After visiting this temple, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the bank of the river Kāverī via the district of Tiruchchirāpalli. The Kāverī is mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.5.40) as a very pious river.
