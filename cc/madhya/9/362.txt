===== Purport =====

One must have firm faith in the process of devotional service and the scriptures that support it. If one hears the activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with this faith, he can be freed from his envious position. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is meant for such nonenvious persons (//nirmatsarāṇāṁ satām//). In this age a person should not envy Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement but should chant the holy names of Hari and Kṛṣṇa, the //mahā-mantra.// That is the sum and substance of the eternal religion, known as //sanātana-dharma.// In this verse the word //vaiṣṇava// refers to a pure devotee and fully realized soul, and the word //vaiṣṇava-śāstra// refers to //śruti,// or the //Vedas,// which are called //śabda-pramāṇa,// the evidence of transcendental sound. One who strictly follows the Vedic literature and chants the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will actually be situated in the transcendental disciplic succession. Those who want to attain life's ultimate goal must follow this principle. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.19.17), it is said:

> śrutiḥ pratyakṣam aitihyam
> anumānaṁ catuṣṭayam
> pramāṇeṣv anavasthānād
> vikalpāt sa virajyate

"Vedic literature, direct perception, history and hypothesis are the four kinds of evidential proofs. Everyone should stick to these principles for the realization of the Absolute Truth."
