===== Purport =====

The authorities in the Vedic literature known as the //śruti-gaṇa// desired to enter into Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa// dance; therefore they began to worship the Lord in the ecstasy of the //gopīs.// In the beginning, however, they were unsuccessful. When they could not enter the dance simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the ecstasy of the //gopīs,// they actually accepted bodies like those of the //gopīs.// They even took birth in Vrajabhūmi just like the //gopīs// and consequently became engrossed in the ecstasy of the //gopīs'// love. In this way they were allowed to enter into the //rāsa-līlā// dance of the Lord.
