===== Purport =====

In the //Śrī Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka// (eighth part) Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Sārvabhauma, I have traveled to many holy places, but I cannot find a Vaiṣṇava as good as you anywhere. However, I must admit that Rāmānanda Rāya is wonderful."

Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya replied, "Therefore, my Lord, I requested that You see him."

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "There are, of course, many Vaiṣṇavas in these holy places, and most of them worship Lord Nārāyaṇa. Others, who are called Tattvavādīs, are also Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa worshipers, but they do not belong to the pure Vaiṣṇava cult. There are many worshipers of Lord Śiva, and there are also many atheists. Regardless, My dear Bhaṭṭācārya, I very much like Rāmānanda Rāya and his opinions."
