===== Purport =====

Although the //brāhmaṇa// could not pronounce the words very well due to illiteracy, he still experienced ecstatic symptoms while reading the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very much pleased to observe these symptoms, and this indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased by devotion, not by erudite scholarship. Even though the words were imperfectly pronounced, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, did not think this very serious. Rather, the Lord was pleased by the //bhāva// (devotion). In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:5:11|(1.5.11)]] this is confirmed:

> tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavo
> yasmin prati-ślokam abaddhavaty api
> nāmāny anantasya yaśo-'ṅkitāni yat
> śṛṇvanti gāyanti gṛṇanti sādhavaḥ

"On the other hand, that literature which is full of descriptions of the transcendental glories of the name, fame, forms and pastimes of the unlimited Supreme Lord is a different creation, full of transcendental words directed toward bringing about a revolution in the impious lives of this world's misdirected civilization. Such transcendental literature, even though imperfectly composed, is heard, sung and accepted by purified men who are thoroughly honest."
