According to the Tattvavādīs, the best process for achieving the highest goal of life is to execute the duties of the four //varṇas// and //āśramas.// In the material world, unless one is situated in one of the //varṇas// (//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra//) one cannot manage social affairs properly to attain the ultimate goal. One also has to follow the principles of the //āśramas// (//brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa//), for these principles are considered essential for the attainment of the highest goal. In this way the Tattvavādīs establish that the execution of the principles of //varṇa// and //āśrama// for the sake of Kṛṣṇa is the best way to attain the topmost goal. The Tattvavādīs thus established their principles in terms of human society. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, however, differed when He said that the best process is hearing and chanting about Lord Viṣṇu. According to the Tattvavādīs, the highest goal is returning home, back to Godhead, but in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's opinion the highest goal is attaining love of Godhead, either in the material world or in the spiritual world. In the material world this is practiced according to śāstric injunction, and in the spiritual world the real achievement is already there.
