===== Purport =====

This is the way to understand the truth about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After hearing the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna said very much the same thing:

> sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye
> yan māṁ vadasi keśava
> na hi te bhagavan vyaktiṁ
> vidur devā na dānavāḥ

"O Kṛṣṇa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality." [[books:bg:10:14|(Bg. 10.14)]]

It is not possible to understand the truth about the pastimes of the Lord simply by using our own logic, argument and academic education. We must receive bona fide information from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as Arjuna received information when Kṛṣṇa spoke the //Bhagavad-gītā.// We have to accept the //Bhagavad-gītā// or any other Vedic literature in good faith. These Vedic scriptures are the only source of knowledge about the Lord. We must understand that we cannot comprehend the Absolute Truth by the speculative process.
