===== Purport =====

The word //apavitra anna// refers to food that is unacceptable for a Vaiṣṇava. In other words, a Vaiṣṇava cannot accept any food offered by an //avaiṣṇava// in the name of //mahā-prasāda.// This should be a principle for all Vaiṣṇavas. When asked, "What is the behavior of a Vaiṣṇava?" Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, "A Vaiṣṇava must avoid the company of an //avaiṣṇava// [//asat//]." The word //asat// refers to an //avaiṣṇava,// that is, one who is not a Vaiṣṇava. //Asat-saṅga-tyāga//,-//ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|(Cc. Madhya 22.87)]]. A Vaiṣṇava must be very strict in this respect and should not at all cooperate with an //avaiṣṇava.// If an //avaiṣṇava// offers food in the name of //mahā-prasāda,// it should not be accepted. Such food cannot be //prasāda// because an //avaiṣṇava// cannot offer anything to the Lord. Sometimes preachers in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have to accept food in a home where the householder is an //avaiṣṇava;// however, if this food is offered to the Deity, it can be taken. Ordinary food cooked by an //avaiṣṇava// should not be accepted by a Vaiṣṇava. Even if an //avaiṣṇava// cooks food without fault, he cannot offer it to Lord Viṣṇu, and it cannot be accepted as //mahā-prasāda.// According to Lord Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]]:

> patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
> yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
> tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam
> aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ

"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it."

Kṛṣṇa can accept anything offered by His devotee with devotion. An //avaiṣṇava// may be a vegetarian and a very clean cook, but because he cannot offer the food he cooks to Viṣṇu, it cannot be accepted as //mahā-prasāda.// It is better that a Vaiṣṇava abandon such food as untouchable.
