Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura remarks that only two //khaṇḍas// of the //Kūrma Purāṇa// are now available, namely the //Pūrva-khaṇḍa// and //Uttara-khaṇḍa.// Sometimes it is said that the //Kūrma Purāṇa// contains six thousand verses, but originally the //Kūrma Purāṇa// contained seventeen thousand verses. According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there are seventeen thousand verses in the //Kūrma Purāṇa,// which is one of the eighteen //Mahā-purāṇas.// The //Kūrma Purāṇa// is considered the fifteenth of these //Mahā-purāṇas.//
