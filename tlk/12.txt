**In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and his attraction becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service begin.**

**Thus consciously engaged in devotional service in the association of devotees, a person gains distaste for sense gratification, both in this world and in the next, by constantly thinking about the activities of the Lord. This process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the easiest process of mystic power; when one is actually situated on that path of devotional service, he is able to control the mind.**

The process of advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service is described here. The first point is that one must seek the association of persons who are Kṛṣṇa conscious and who engage in devotional service. Without such association one cannot advance. Simply by theoretical knowledge or study one cannot make any appreciable advancement. One must give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of devotees because without such association one cannot understand the activities of the Lord. Generally, people are convinced of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Because they do not associate with devotees, they cannot understand that the Absolute Truth can be a person and have personal activities. This is a very difficult subject matter, and unless one has personal understanding of the Absolute Truth, there is no meaning to devotion. Service or devotion cannot be offered to anything impersonal. Service must be offered to a person. Nondevotees cannot appreciate Kṛṣṇa consciousness by reading the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or any other Vedic literature wherein the activities of the Lord are described; they think that these activities are fictional, because spiritual life is not explained to them in the proper mood. To understand the personal activities of the Lord, one has to seek the association of devotees, and by such association, when one contemplates and tries to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, the path to liberation is open, and he is freed. One who has firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes fixed, and his attraction for association with the Lord and the devotees increases. Association with devotees means association with the Lord. The devotee who makes this association develops the consciousness for rendering service to the Lord, and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he gradually becomes perfect.

In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that they can enjoy sense gratification not only in this life but also in the next. For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly kingdom of higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association of devotees prefers to contemplate the activities of the Lord---how He has created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how the creation dissolves, and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord's pastimes are enacted. There are full literatures describing these activities, especially //Bhagavad-gītā, Brahma-saṁhitā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The sincere devotee who associates with devotees gets the opportunity to hear and contemplate these subjects, and the result is that he feels distaste for so-called happiness in this or that world, in heaven or on other planets. The devotees are simply interested in being transferred to the personal association of the Lord; they are no longer attracted to temporary so-called happiness. That is the position of one who is //yoga-yukta.// One who is fixed in mystic power is not disturbed by the allurement of this world or that world; he is interested in spiritual understanding. This is very easily attained by the easiest process, //bhakti-yoga. Ṛjubhir yoga-mārgaiḥ [[books:sb:3:25:26|[SB 3.25.26]]].// A very suitable word used here is //ṛjubhiḥ,// or "very easy." There are different processes of //yoga-mārga,// attaining //yoga// perfection, but this process, devotional service to the Lord, is the easiest. Not only is it the easiest process, but the result is sublime. Everyone, therefore, should try this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and reach the highest perfection.

//Sat// means "existence," and //asat// means "that which does not exist," that which is temporary. The material world is //asat;// therefore the //Vedas// enjoin: //asato mā sad gama:// "Do not remain within this material world." Those who are interested in materialistic life are also called //asat.// When asked how a Vaiṣṇava behaves, Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied, //asat-saṅga-tyāga-ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra:// "A devotee first of all avoids the company of //asat,// those who are materially interested." [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|(Cc. Madhya 22.87)]] We have established this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in order to avoid //asat-saṅga,// association with those who are interested in material things. Because we are associating with Kṛṣṇa, we do not wish to talk about anything but Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is interested in this business or that, and we are exclusively interested in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness business. Those who are //asat// are very much attached to sense gratification, and the culmination of sense gratification is sex.

In addition, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī in his //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// recommends that one should not hear //Bhagavad-gītā,// the //purāṇas,// the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or any //hari-kathā// from anyone who is not a Vaiṣṇava in his actions. That means that we should not hear these Vedic literatures from the Māyāvādīs, who actually do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord and yet dare to speak on //Bhagavad-gītā?// We will never derive any benefit from listening to the commentaries of such people. //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// should be heard from the devotees. We can hear //Bhagavad-gītā// from Māyāvādīs for hundreds of years and yet never understand Kṛṣṇa. It is therefore forbidden for Vaiṣṇavas to hear talks given by Māyāvādīs.

//Hari-kathā,// talks about Śrī Hari, or Kṛṣṇa, are //amṛta,// nectar. If one hears them from the right source, he attains //amṛta (so 'mṛtatvāya kalpate). Mṛta// means "birth and death," and //amṛta// means "the cessation of birth and death." Spiritual life means putting an end to birth, old age, disease and death. Getting //amṛta,// nectar, means getting relief from birth and death, and that is the real aim of spiritual life. Lord Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:16|(7.16)]] that spiritual life begins when one is pious:

> catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ
> janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna
> ārto jijñāsur arthārthī
> jñānī ca bharatarṣabha

"O best among the Bhāratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me---the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute."

If we actually want to become pious and develop our devotional life, we have to associate unflinchingly with a //sādhu.// Then we can acquire some taste for Kṛṣṇa. When we discuss Kṛṣṇa with a //sādhu,// the discussion becomes very pleasing, and we develop some taste, which is called //rasa,// or mellow. //Rasa// is the enjoyment we derive from drinking something very nice when we are thirsty. Kṛṣṇa has instructed us to think of Him when drinking water. This is not very difficult. Kṛṣṇa also tells us to think of Him when we see sunlight in the morning. Why do we say, "Can you show me God?" God is showing us Himself. Why do we close our eyes to try to see Him? He says, "I am this, and I am that." It is not that suddenly we can expect to see God, but we can become qualified to see God through the association of a //sādhu.// Presently many people are interested in receiving degrees from big universities, but education without God consciousness is simply an expansion of //māyā's// influence. Because knowledge is taken away by illusion, the universities are simply presenting impediments on the path of God consciousness. The living entity is already illusioned when he comes into the material world, and so-called advanced education simply increases his illusion. Trying to become happy in this temporary, material life, the living entity has forgotten that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Even if one becomes happy in this temporary life, his happiness is an illusion because no one is allowed to stay and enjoy his happiness. These points have to be understood in the association of devotees. A devotee knows everything because he has seen the Supreme Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa.

What is the goal of //vedānta-darśana? Veda// means "knowledge," and //anta// means "ultimate." What is that ultimate knowledge? In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(15.15)]] Śrī Kṛṣṇa says:

> vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
> vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham

"By all the //Vedas,// I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of //Vedānta,// and I am the knower of the //Vedas.//"

If we listen to Kṛṣṇa and understand what and who He is, we can actually understand //Vedānta.// If we do not understand Kṛṣṇa but advertise ourselves as Vedāntists, we are just being illusioned. Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, one is actually a //mūḍha,// a fool. People do not know it, but actually anyone in the material world is more or less a //mūḍha.// We are all //mūḍhas,// for unless we are //mūḍhas,// we do not come into the material world. From Brahmā down to the smallest ant, we are all //mūḍhas// of different degrees. In order to become really learned, we have to associate with devotees. Then we can actually relish //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// When discussed among devotees, //kṛṣṇa-kathā// is pleasing to the heart and ear. This requires a little training, and this training is given by the devotees. We should follow the devotees in their practical daily life, in their routine work and behavior. Cultivation means practice, and the great //ācāryas// have given a routine we can cultivate. For instance, //The Nectar of Devotion// by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī deals with the cultivation of devotional service, and this book, which we have translated, has been very well received in European and American universities. //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, The Nectar of Devotion,// is the actual science of //bhakti. Bhakti// is not sentiment; it is a great science, and we have to learn it scientifically. It is not that we have to wait for another life to cultivate devotional service. We can read //The Nectar of Devotion,// live with devotees, rise early in the morning to attend //maṅgala-ārati,// study Vedic literature, take //prasāda// and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

//Māyā// is very strong, and to begin devotional service is to declare war against //māyā.// Some of the devotees in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement may fall down, but whatever is done sincerely is to their permanent credit. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā.// If one renders a little devotional service, he does not fall down into the lower species but again attains a human form. There are 8,400,000 species, but the fallen devotee is guaranteed a human life. If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is assured of a good birth in the next life. However, if one completes his Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this life, he will not take birth again but will go to Kṛṣṇa. This is what is actually wanted. Why take the chance of being born into a rich family or a //brāhmaṇa// family? Actually, such a birth is quite risky because there is really no guarantee. Generally, those who are rich don't care at all for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and those who are born in //brāhmaṇa// families generally become puffed-up, thinking, "I am a //brāhmaṇa.// I am born in a very high family." Thinking this brings about their falldown. It is said that pride precedes a fall. A Vaiṣṇava is by nature very humble.

These are the chances one takes when one becomes a human being. Kṛṣṇa is personally advising us to take up the opportunities offered by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We should take them and not run the risk of committing spiritual suicide.

This is the process for understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Being. In the Absolute, there are no contradictions. Kṛṣṇa's name, form, activities, paraphernalia and attributes are identical with Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of absolute. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's form and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's hands and Kṛṣṇa's legs are nondifferent. In the material world, there is a difference between our left hand and our right hand, between the nose and the ear, but these dualities do not exist in Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of absolute. As stated in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.32):

> aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti
> paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti
> ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth and substantiality, and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses, in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane." The different parts of our bodies serve different purposes, but any limb of Kṛṣṇa's body can serve any purpose. Kṛṣṇa can eat through His eyes, or Kṛṣṇa can go somewhere simply by thinking. The Absolute is //advaita.// There is no duality in the Absolute. Everything is one.

Our material disease lies in wanting to satisfy our senses. We have stated before that advancement of civilization means advancement of sense gratification, but //bhakti// means just the opposite. As long as we are interested in sense gratification, there is no question of //bhakti.// We have to reduce our tendency for sense gratification and increase our devotional activities. We have also stated that material bondage means accepting one body and creating another. Kṛṣṇa, through nature, will give us full facility to enjoy our senses. Presently in the Western countries it has become fashionable to run around naked. Therefore nature will give these people an opportunity to stand naked like trees for many years. Why are we receiving different bodies? Because we have different tendencies for sense gratification. We actually have to come to detest sense gratification before our spiritual life begins. This is made possible through //bhakti.// Although Kṛṣṇa is beyond our vision, He has agreed to be seen by us through the //arcā-vigraha,// the Deity. We should not think that the Deity is made of stone. Even if it is stone, we should think that Kṛṣṇa has made Himself visible before us like a stone because we cannot see beyond stone. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Because our eyes and other senses are imperfect, we cannot see Kṛṣṇa present everywhere in His original spiritual form. Because we are imperfect, we see the difference between things spiritual and material, but Kṛṣṇa, being absolute, knows no such distinctions. He can become spiritual or material, however He likes, and it does not make any difference to Him. Being almighty and omnipotent, Kṛṣṇa can change matter into spirit and spirit into matter. Therefore we should not think, as the atheists do, that we are worshiping idols. Even if it is an idol, it is still Kṛṣṇa. That is the absolute nature of Kṛṣṇa. Even if we think that the Deity is a stone, or a piece of metal or some wood, He is still Kṛṣṇa. The understanding of this requires //bhakti// on our part. If we are a little thoughtful and philosophical, and if we are at all inclined toward //bhakti,// we can understand that Kṛṣṇa is present in stone.

Actually, nothing is different from Kṛṣṇa because everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy. The Māyāvādī philosophers say that since everything is God, the personality of Kṛṣṇa is finished. But actually Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa, and at the same time He is everything. We can understand this by //bhakti,// but not by any other process. When a //bhakta// sees a tree, he sees Kṛṣṇa. As explained in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|(Madhya 8.274)]]:

> sthāvara jaṅgama dekhe, nā dekhe tāra mūrti
> sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti

The advanced devotee does not see living entities as moving and not moving. He sees Kṛṣṇa. This is also stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.38):

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti

Because his eyes are always smeared with the ointment of devotion, the devotee always sees Kṛṣṇa and nothing else. He sees Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's energy everywhere. For instance, if you love your child, when you see your child's shoe, you immediately see your child. Or if you see your child's toy, you immediately see your child and hear his voice. Similarly, if we have actually developed love of Kṛṣṇa, nothing exists but Kṛṣṇa. When our love for Kṛṣṇa is actually developed, whatever we see, we will see Kṛṣṇa.

Unless one is advanced in //kṛṣṇa-premā,// love of Kṛṣṇa, he cannot see or understand. By the blunt material senses, we cannot even understand the name of Kṛṣṇa. People are always asking, "Why are these people chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?" They cannot understand, although Kṛṣṇa realization begins with the name. The name of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent, but we cannot realize this intellectually. We have to practice chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa to realize it. When we actually advance in devotional service and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// offenselessly, we will realize that Kṛṣṇa and His name are nondifferent. Thus //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// begins with the tongue, for we can utilize the tongue to chant, and to taste //kṛṣṇa-prasāda.// In this way we can become a Kṛṣṇa //bhakta.//

When we see the Deity of Kṛṣṇa in the temple, we should think that the Deity is Kṛṣṇa. In this way Kṛṣṇa has agreed to be seen by us and even dressed by us. However, if we think of Kṛṣṇa's //virāṭ-rūpa,// His universal form, what can we do? How can we dress the //virāṭ-rūpa?// His many heads cover the sky, and we cannot even conceive of Him. Kṛṣṇa can become bigger than the biggest and smaller than the smallest. Therefore this verse states: //bhaktyā pumāñ jāta-virāga aindriyāt.// The more we serve Kṛṣṇa, give Him things to eat and dress Him nicely, the less we become interested in our own bodies. In the material world everyone is very busy dressing himself very nicely in order to be sexually attractive, but if we try to dress Kṛṣṇa nicely, we will forget our own material dress. If we feed Kṛṣṇa nice food, we will forget to satisfy our own tongue by going to this or that restaurant.

Kṛṣṇa was teaching //Bhagavad-gītā,// and Arjuna was seeing Him face to face, but seeing Kṛṣṇa and reading //Bhagavad-gītā// are the same. Some people say that Arjuna was fortunate to have seen Kṛṣṇa face to face and take instructions from Him, but Kṛṣṇa can be seen immediately, provided one has the eyes to see. There is the example in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// of a //brāhmaṇa// in South India who was reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// although he was illiterate. The people in the neighborhood knew that he was illiterate, and they made jokes, asking him, "Well, how is it you are reading //Bhagavad-gītā?//" One day Caitanya Mahāprabhu happened to be in a temple nearby, and He could understand that this man was a devotee. He therefore approached him and asked, "My dear //brāhmaṇa,// what are you reading?" The //brāhmaṇa// replied, "I am reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// or, rather, I am trying to read //Bhagavad-gītā.// I happen to be illiterate, but my //guru-mahārāja// has said that I must read the eighteen chapters of //Bhagavad-gītā// daily. I am simply trying to carry out his order, and therefore I am opening and closing the pages." Caitanya Mahāprabhu then said, "I see that you are crying sometimes. Why is this?" The //brāhmaṇa// replied, "Yes, I am crying because when I take up this book, I see a picture of Kṛṣṇa driving Arjuna's chariot. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has accepted the position of a servant to His devotee. Therefore when I see this picture, I weep." Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu then immediately embraced the //brāhmaṇa// and said, "You have actually read //Bhagavad-gītā.//"

It is not that a wealth of education is required. One does not even have to understand the language. The only ingredient needed is //bhakti,// love. If one becomes a pure //bhakta,// he will forget all material sense enjoyment. Being a //bhakta// doesn't simply mean wearing //tilaka// and robes. One is not a //bhakta// if he has a taste for material sense enjoyment. A true //bhakta// wants to satisfy not his senses but the senses of Kṛṣṇa. That is the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, Vṛndāvana, everyone---mother Yaśodā, Nanda Mahārāja, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the //gopīs,// the cowherd boys, Śrīdāmā, Sudāmā, the land, the water, the trees, the birds---all are trying to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is the real meaning of Vṛndāvana. When Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana for Mathurā, everyone in Vṛndāvana fell dead out of separation from Him. Similarly, we can always live in Vṛndāvana, in Vaikuṇṭha, if we are mad after Kṛṣṇa. This is the teaching of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He illustrated this by His very life. When He was in Jagannātha Purī, He was always mad after Kṛṣṇa day and night. The last twelve years of His life were passed in madness. Sometimes He threw Himself into the ocean, and He wandered about like a madman. Of course, this is not possible for ordinary living entities. However, if we become //bhaktas,// we will find intelligence behind everything in the creation. If we take a flower and see its constitution, how it is made and how its colors are displayed and how it comes into existence, we can see Kṛṣṇa. We can see how Kṛṣṇa has created such a beautiful thing so intelligently. We should not consider like rascals that such a thing has come into being automatically. Fools cannot see, but those who are intelligent can see that the hand of the Supreme Lord is in everything within the creation. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].//

Actually, nothing comes about automatically. Everything comes about through the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa, through His fine and accurate powers. If we paint a picture of a flower, we have to arrange many facets, and still the picture will not be absolutely perfect. Yet the flower created by Kṛṣṇa has come out perfectly. What rascal can say that there is no brain behind it? Kṛṣṇa specifically says that we should not think that //prakṛti,// nature, is working automatically. He says, "Nature is working under My direction." One simply has to develop the eyes to see how these things are going on. This is possible if we engage the senses in the service of Kṛṣṇa. We first of all must engage the tongue in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and in eating //bhagavat-prasāda.// Nothing else is required. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is distributing //prasāda// and engaging people in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//

**Thus by not engaging in the service of the modes of material nature but by developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, knowledge in renunciation, and by practicing yoga, in which the mind is always fixed in devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one achieves My association in this very life, for I am the Supreme Personality, the Absolute Truth.**

When one engages in the nine different processes of //bhakti-yoga// enunciated in authoritative scriptures, such as hearing (//śravaṇam//), chanting (//kīrtanam//), remembering, worshiping, praying and offering personal service---either in one of them or two or three or all of them---he naturally has no opportunity to engage in the service of the three modes of material nature. Unless one has good engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to become detached from material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are interested in so-called humanitarian or philanthropic work, such as opening a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good works in the sense that they are pious activities, and the performer may get some opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life or in the next. Devotional service, however, is beyond the boundary of sense gratification. It is a completely spiritual activity. When one engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, he does not engage in sense gratificatory activities. Kṛṣṇa conscious activities are performed not blindly but with the perfect understanding of knowledge and renunciation. This kind of //yoga// practice, in which the mind is always fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The person who performs such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya, therefore, approved the process of hearing from realized devotees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does not matter to what mundane category the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconquerable by any other process. Hearing and associating with devotees are the most important functions for self-realization.

In Goloka Vṛndāvana, the living entities are serving Kṛṣṇa as friends, cowherd boys, //gopīs,// lovers, fathers, mothers and so on. Even the trees, water, flowers, land, calves and cows serve Kṛṣṇa in Goloka Vṛndāvana. This is also our business, but somehow or other we do not like to serve Kṛṣṇa; therefore we have been put into the service of //māyā,// in the three modes of material nature. When a criminal does not like to obey the laws of the state, he is placed into prison and forced to abide by the laws. Our constitutional position is to render service to Kṛṣṇa as His part and parcel, and as soon as we refuse to render Him service, //māyā// is immediately there to capture us and say, "Serve me." It is not our nature to become master. Even if we become master, we will not be happy, because that is artificial. For instance, if the hand thinks, "Oh, now I have some nice sweets. Now I can eat," the hand will ultimately be frustrated. It is the duty and nature of the hand to place the food in the mouth. In this way the hand is nourished; otherwise everything is spoiled. Similarly, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, and our business is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. From the //Vedas// we understand that God, who is one, has become many. We are the many parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa. //Svāṁśas// are His personal expansions, and we are His differential expansions, //vibhinnāṁśas.// In any case, all expansions are meant to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is explained in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|(Ādi 5.142)]]: //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya.// "Lord Kṛṣṇa alone is the supreme controller, and all others are His servants."

It is our natural propensity to enjoy ourselves with Kṛṣṇa. As stated before, Kṛṣṇa is //ānanda-maya,// and, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we are also //ānanda-maya.// Now we are seeking //ānanda// (bliss) in different atmospheres. Because we have a little independence, we have decided to go to the prison house of material nature and try to serve our senses instead of Kṛṣṇa. Now we have to learn how to forget to serve this material nature, and that process is //bhakti-mārga,// the path of devotional service. When we come to the understanding that we are actually no one's servant but Kṛṣṇa's, we attain self-realization. We must come to this understanding not by sentiment but by real knowledge. After many births and deaths, when one realizes that //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]---Vāsudeva is all---he surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. This is real knowledge---//jñāna// and //vairāgya,// knowledge and detachment from material things.

Once one engages fully in Kṛṣṇa's service, he comes to the //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]] platform. Presently we are on the //māyā-bhūta// platform, identifying ourselves with //māyā// and working according to the modes of material nature. However, when one comes to the realization that he is spirit (//ahaṁ brahmāsmi//), he will immediately become happy.

Under the modes of material nature, we are being carried away by the waves of material nature, and we have no control over where we are going. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has stated: //māyāra vaśe, yāccha bhese', khāccha hābuḍubu, bhāi.// We are like straws on the waves of the ocean, and we are fully under the control of the waves. Atheists shudder when they think that there is a next life, because their lives are sinful and they fear punishment in the next. There is a Bengali proverb about a person who thought, "I have committed so many sinful acts that Yamarāja will come and punish me. How can I avoid him?" Thinking about this some time, he decided, "Let me smear my body with stool. Then Yamarāja will not touch me." However, this is simply foolishness. We are under the control of //māyā,// material nature, and it is not possible to avoid it. We have become infected by the disease of material nature, and no artificial means will save us. There is no way out other than surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says that He will save us, even though we are very sinful.

If we turn our attention to Kṛṣṇa's service, to //bhakti-yoga,// we can force ourselves to give up all //anarthas,// unwanted things. We should get up early in the morning and engage ourselves in the service of Kṛṣṇa; then gradually we will forget the service of //māyā. Bhakti-yoga// is so strong that if we engage in it, //māyā's// service will automatically be negated. This is called //vairāgya.//

Kṛṣṇa is the original //puruṣa,// the original spirit, the original person. Everything has come from Kṛṣṇa, and therefore He is //Purāṇa,// the oldest. No one is older than Kṛṣṇa, but He is always young. That is Bhagavān. He is //ādi,// the original source, the cause of all causes. Yet we never see Kṛṣṇa as an old man. He is always fresh and youthful. Although Kṛṣṇa was a great-grandfather at the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He did not appear any older than a young man of twenty. Kṛṣṇa is always a young boy, and those living entities in the spiritual universe also have spiritual bodies the same as Kṛṣṇa's. In the Sixth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// we read that when the Vaikuṇṭha-dūtas came to take Ajāmila, they were four-handed and very beautiful. In the spiritual world, there are four-handed living entities, and they are all //nitya-mukta,// eternally liberated.

Unfortunately, we are now prisoners in this material world, and we presently have material bodies. These bodies are changing. Sometimes they are young and sometimes old. However, if we become Kṛṣṇa conscious, we will not get another material body after leaving this body. We will go home, back to Godhead, and attain our original, spiritual body, which is the same kind of beautiful body that Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa, has. We should take this opportunity to become devotees of Kṛṣṇa by following the processes of //bhakti-yoga-śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]].// pāda-sevanaṁ arcanam.// We can take one or all of the nine processes of devotional service and make our lives successful. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has prescribed the most important process-//śravaṇam.// We need only hear, and that will make our lives successful.
