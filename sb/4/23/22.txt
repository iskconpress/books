===== Purport =====

The entrance of a chaste wife into the flames of the pyre of her dead husband is known as //saha-gamana,// which means "dying with the husband." This system of //saha-gamana// had been practiced in Vedic civilization from time immemorial. Even after the British period in India this practice was rigidly observed, but soon it degraded to the point that even when the wife was not strong enough to enter the fire of her dead husband, the relatives would force her to enter. Thus this practice had to be stopped, but even today there are still some solitary cases where a wife will voluntarily enter the fire and die with her husband. Even after 1940  we personally knew of a chaste wife who died in this way.
