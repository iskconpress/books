===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //bhagavattamaḥ// is very significant, for the word //bhagavat// is used especially to refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the word //bhagavān// ("the Supreme Personality of Godhead") is derived from the word //bhagavat.// Sometimes, however, we see that the word //bhagavān// is used for great personalities like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Nārada Muni. This is the case with Pṛthu Mahārāja, who is described here as the best of the //bhagavāns,// or the best of the lords. A person can be so addressed only if he is a great personality who exhibits extraordinary and uncommon features or who attains the greatest goal after his disappearance or who knows the difference between knowledge and ignorance. In other words, the word //bhagavān// should not be used for ordinary persons.
