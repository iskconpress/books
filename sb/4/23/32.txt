**If one hears of the characteristics of Pṛthu Mahārāja and is a brāhmaṇa, he becomes perfectly qualified with brahminical powers; if he is a kṣatriya, he becomes a king of the world; if he is a vaiśya, he becomes a master of other vaiśyas and many animals; and if he is a śūdra, he becomes the topmost devotee.**

===== Purport =====

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is recommended that one should become a devotee regardless of one's condition. Whether one is without desire (//akāma//) or with desire (//sakāma//), or whether one desires liberation (//mokṣa-kāma//), he is advised to worship the Supreme Lord and execute devotional service unto Him. By so doing, one attains all perfection in any field of life. The process of devotional service---especially hearing and chanting---is so powerful that it can bring a person to the perfectional stage. In this verse //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras// are mentioned, but here it should be understood that that reference is to the //brāhmaṇa// who is born in a brahminical family, the //kṣatriya// who is born in a //kṣatriya// family, the //vaiśya// who is born in a //vaiśya// family and the //śūdra// in a //śūdra// family. But whether one is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// he can attain perfection simply by hearing and chanting.

To take birth in a family of //brāhmaṇas// is not the ultimate finishing touch; one must have the power of a //brāhmaṇa,// which is called //brahma-tejas.// Similarly, taking birth in a royal family is not the all in all; one must possess the power to rule the world. Similarly, taking birth as a //vaiśya// is not all; one must possess hundreds or thousands of animals (specifically cows) and rule over other //vaiśyas// as Nanda Mahārāja did in Vṛndāvana. Nanda Mahārāja was a //vaiśya// who possessed nine hundred thousand cows and ruled over many cowherd men and boys. A person who is born in a //śūdra// family can become greater than a //brāhmaṇa// simply by accepting devotional service and giving aural reception to the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees.
