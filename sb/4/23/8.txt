===== Purport =====

The word //prāṇāyāmaiḥ// is very important in this verse because the //haṭha-yogīs// and //aṣṭāṅga-yogīs// practice //prāṇāyāma,// but generally they do not know the purpose behind it. The purpose of //prāṇāyāma,// or mystic //yoga,// is to stop the mind and senses from engaging in fruitive activities. The so-called //yogīs// who practice in Western countries have no idea of this. The aim of //prāṇāyāma// is not to make the body strong and fit for working hard. The aim is worship of Kṛṣṇa. In the previous verse it was specifically mentioned that whatever austerity, //prāṇāyāma// and mystic //yoga// practices Pṛthu Mahārāja performed were performed for the sake of worshiping Kṛṣṇa. Thus Pṛthu Mahārāja serves as a perfect example for //yogīs// also. Whatever he did, he did to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.

The minds of those who are addicted to fruitive activity are always filled with unclean desires. Fruitive activities are symptomatic of our polluted desire to dominate material nature. As long as one continues to be subject to polluted desires, he has to accept one material body after another. So-called //yogīs,// without knowledge of the real purpose of //yoga,// practice it in order to keep the body fit. Thus they engage themselves in fruitive activities, and thus they are bound by desire to accept another body. They are not aware that the ultimate goal of life is to approach Kṛṣṇa. In order to save such //yogīs// from wandering throughout the different species of life, the //śāstras// warn that in this age such yogic practice is simply a waste of time. The only means of elevation is the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//

King Pṛthu's activities took place in Satya-yuga, and in this age this practice of //yoga// is misunderstood by fallen souls who are not capable of practicing anything. Consequently the //śāstras// enjoin: //kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// The conclusion is that unless the //karmīs, jñānīs// and //yogīs// come to the point of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, their so-called austerities and //yoga// have no value. //Nārādhitaḥ:// if Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not worshiped, there is no point in practicing meditational //yoga,// performing //karma-yoga// or culturing empiric knowledge. As far as //prāṇāyāma// is concerned, chanting of the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy are also considered //prāṇāyāma.// In a previous verse, Sanat-kumāra instructed Mahārāja Pṛthu to engage constantly in the service of the Supreme Lord, Vāsudeva:

> yat pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā
> karmāśayaṁ grathitam udgrathayanti santaḥ

Only by worshiping Vāsudeva can one become free from the desires of fruitive activities. Outside of worshiping Vāsudeva, the //yogīs// and //jñānīs// cannot attain freedom from such desires.

> tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo 'pi ruddha-
> sroto-gaṇās tam araṇaṁ bhaja vāsudevam
> [[books:sb:4:22:39|(SB 4.22.39)]]

Here the word //prāṇāyāma// does not refer to any ulterior motive. The actual aim is to strengthen the mind and senses in order to engage them in devotional service. In the present age this determination can be very easily acquired simply by chanting the holy names---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
