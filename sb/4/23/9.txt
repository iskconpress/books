===== Purport =====

In this verse it is clearly said that Mahārāja Pṛthu, practicing the //prāṇāyāma-yoga// system, engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as advised by the saint Sanat-kumāra. In this verse the words //puruṣam abhajat puruṣarṣabhaḥ// are significant: //puruṣarṣabha// refers to Mahārāja Pṛthu, the best amongst human beings, and //puruṣam// refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the best man amongst all men engages in the service of the Supreme Person. One //puruṣa// is worshipable, and the other //puruṣa// is the worshiper. When the //puruṣa// who worships, the living entity, thinks of becoming one with the Supreme person, he simply becomes bewildered and falls into the darkness of ignorance. As stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:12|(Bg. 2.12)]], all living entities assembled in the battlefield, as well as Kṛṣṇa Himself, were also present in the past as individuals and would continue to be present in the future as individuals also. Therefore the two //puruṣas,// the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never lose their respective identities.

Actually, one who is self-realized engages himself in the service of the Lord perpetually, both in this life and in the next. Indeed, for devotees there is no difference between this life and the next. In this life a neophyte devotee is trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in the next life he approaches that Supreme Person in Vaikuṇṭha and renders the same devotional service. Even for the neophyte devotee, devotional service is considered //brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. Devotional service to the Lord is never considered a material activity. Since he is acting on the //brahma-bhūta// platform, a devotee is already liberated. He therefore has no need to practice any other type of //yoga// in order to approach the //brahma-bhūta// stage [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]]. If the devotee adheres strictly to the orders of the spiritual master, follows the rules and regulations and chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// it should be concluded that he is already at the //brahma-bhūta// stage, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]:

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate

"One who is engaged in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."
