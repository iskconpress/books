===== Purport =====

These are some of the austerities executed by the //jñānīs// and //yogīs,// who cannot accept the process of //bhakti-yoga.// They must undergo such severe types of austerity in order to become purified from material contamination. //pañca-tapāḥ// refers to five kinds of heating processes. One is enjoined to sit within a circle of fire, with flames blazing from four sides and the sun blazing directly overhead. This is one kind of //pañca-tapāḥ// recommended for austerity. Similarly, in the rainy season one is enjoined to expose himself to torrents of rain and in winter to sit in cold water up to the neck. As far as bedding is concerned, the ascetic should be content with simply lying on the floor. The purpose for undergoing such severe austerities is to become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as explained in the next verse.
