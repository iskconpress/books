===== Purport =====

By reading and hearing the narrations of the life and character of Pṛthu Mahārāja, one naturally becomes a devotee, and as soon as one becomes a devotee, his material desires automatically become fulfilled. Therefore it is recommended in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:3:10|(2.3.10)]]:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

If a person wants to return home, back to Godhead, or wants to become a pure devotee (//akāma//), or wants some material prosperity (//sakāma// or //sarva-kāma//), or wants to merge into the existence of the Supreme Brahman effulgence (//mokṣa-kāma//), he is recommended to take to the path of devotional service and hear and chant of Lord Viṣṇu or of His devotee. This is the sum and substance of all Vedic literatures. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]. The purpose of Vedic knowledge is to understand Kṛṣṇa and His devotees. Whenever we speak of Kṛṣṇa, we refer to His devotees also, for He is not alone. He is never //nirviśeṣa// or //śūnya,// without variety, or zero. Kṛṣṇa is full of variety, and as soon as Kṛṣṇa is present, there cannot be any question of void.
