===== Translation =====

**Whoever, with great reverence and adoration, regularly reads, chants and describes the history of Mahārāja Pṛthu's activities will certainly increase unflinching faith and attraction for the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord's lotus feet are the boat by which one can cross the ocean of nescience.**

===== Purport =====

The word //bhava-sindhu-pota-pāde// is significant in this verse. The lotus feet of the Lord are known as //mahat-padam;// this means that the total source of material existence rests on the lotus feet of the Lord. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]], //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ:// everything is emanating from Him. This cosmic manifestation, which is compared to an ocean of nescience, is also resting on the lotus feet of the Lord. As such, this great ocean of nescience is minimized by a person who is a pure devotee. One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord need not cross over the ocean, for he has already crossed it by virtue of his position at the Lord's lotus feet. By hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord or the Lord's devotee, one can become firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. This position can also be achieved very easily by narrating the history of the life of Pṛthu Mahārāja regularly every day. The word //vimukta-saṅgaḥ// is also significant in this connection. Because we associate with the three qualities of material nature, our position in this material world is full of dangers, but when we engage in the devotional service of the Lord by the process of //śravaṇam// and //kīrtanam,// we immediately become //vimukta-saṅga,// or liberated.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Mahārāja Pṛthu's Going Back Home."
