**When the heart is cleansed of all material contamination, the devotee's mind becomes broader and transparent, and he can see things equally. At that stage of life there is peace, and one is situated equally with Me as sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1].**

===== Purport =====

The Māyāvāda conception of //kaivalya// and that of the Vaiṣṇava community is different. The Māyāvādī thinks that as soon as one is free from all material contamination, he is merged into the existence of the Supreme. The Vaiṣṇava philosopher's conception of //kaivalya// is different. He understands both his position and the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the uncontaminated condition, the living entity understands that he is the eternal servitor of the Supreme, and that is called Brahman realization, the spiritual perfection of the living entity. This rapport is very easily achieved. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// when one is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is immediately situated on the transcendental platform of //kaivalya,// or Brahman.
