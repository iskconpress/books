===== Purport =====

The sum and substance of religious life is to execute the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one who does so is perfectly religious. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:65|(Bg. 18.65)]] the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:// "Just think of Me always and become My devotee." Furthermore, the Lord says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// "Give up all kinds of material engagement and simply surrender unto Me." [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]] This is the primary principle of religion. Anyone who directly executes such an order from the Personality of Godhead is actually a religious person. Others are described as pretenders, for there are many activities going on throughout the world in the name of religion which are not actually religious. For one who executes the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, there is only good fortune throughout the world.
