===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //vṛddha-sevayā// is very significant. //Vṛddha// means "old." //Sevayā// means "by service." Perfect knowledge is acquired from the //ācāryas,// or liberated souls. No one can be perfect in knowledge without being trained by the //paramparā// system. Pṛthu Mahārāja was completely trained in that line; therefore he did not deserve to be considered an ordinary man. An ordinary man, who has only a conception of bodily existence, is always bewildered by the modes of material nature.
