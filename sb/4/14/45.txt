===== Purport =====

It is said in the //śāstras// that the head of the body represents the //brāhmaṇas,// the arms represent the //kṣatriyas,// the abdomen represents the //vaiśyas,// and the legs, beginning with the thighs, represent the //śūdras.// The //śūdras// are sometimes called black, or //kṛṣṇa.// The //brāhmaṇas// are called //śukla,// or white, and the //kṣatriyas// and the //vaiśyas// are a mixture of black and white. However, those who are extraordinarily white are said to have skin produced out of white leprosy. It may be concluded that white or a golden hue is the color of the higher caste, and black is the complexion of the //śūdras.//
