===== Translation =====

**When the King ascended to the throne, he became all-powerful with eight kinds of opulences. Consequently he became too proud. By virtue of his false prestige, he considered himself to be greater than anyone. Thus he began to insult great personalities.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //aṣṭa-vibhūtibhiḥ,// meaning "by eight opulences," is very important. The king is supposed to possess eight kinds of opulences. By dint of mystic //yoga// practice, kings generally acquired these eight opulences. These kings were called //rājarṣis,// kings who were also great sages. By practicing mystic //yoga,// a //rājarṣi// could become smaller than the smallest, greater than the greatest, and could get whatever he desired. A //rājarṣi// could also create a kingdom, bring everyone under his control and rule everyone. These were some of the opulences of a king. King Vena, however, was not practiced in //yoga,// but he became very proud of his royal position nonetheless. Because he was not very considerate, he began to misuse his power and insult great personalities.
