===== Purport =====

The purity of hereditary succession is called //amogha-vīrya.// The pious seminal succession in the twice-born families of the //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// especially, as well as in the families of //vaiśyas// also, must be kept very pure by the observation of the purificatory processes beginning with //garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,// which is observed before conceiving a child. Unless this purificatory process is strictly observed, especially by the //brāhmaṇas,// the family descendants become impure, and gradually sinful activities become visible in the family. Mahārāja Aṅga was very pure because of the purification of semen in the family of Mahārāja Dhruva. However, his semen became contaminated in association with his wife, Sunīthā, who happened to be the daughter of death personified. Because of this polluted semen, King Vena was produced. This was a catastrophe in the family of Dhruva Mahārāja. All the saintly persons and sages considered this point, and they decided to take action in this matter, as described in the following verses.
