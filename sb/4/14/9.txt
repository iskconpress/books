===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:5|(Bg. 18.5)]] it is stated that even in the renounced order one should not give up sacrifice, charity and penance. The //brahmacārīs// must perform sacrifices, the //gṛhasthas// must give in charity, and those in the renounced order of life (the //vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs//) must practice penance and austerities. These are the procedures by which everyone can be elevated to the spiritual platform. When the sages and saintly persons saw that King Vena had stopped all these functions, they became concerned about the people's progress. Saintly people preach God consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because they are anxious to save the general populace from the dangers of animalistic life. There must be a good government to see that the citizens are actually executing their religious rituals, and thieves and rogues must be curbed. When this is done, the people can advance peacefully in spiritual consciousness and make their lives successful.
