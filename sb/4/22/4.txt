===== Translation =====

**When the great sages accepted their reception, according to the instructions of the śāstras, and finally took their seats offered by the King, the King, influenced by the glories of the sages, immediately bowed down. Thus he worshiped the four Kumāras.**

===== Purport =====

The four Kumāras are //paramparā// spiritual masters of the Vaiṣṇava //sampradāya.// Out of the four //sampradāyas,// namely Brahma-sampradāya, Śrī-sampradāya, Kumāra-sampradāya and Rudra-sampradāya, the disciplic succession of spiritual master to disciple known as the Kumāra-sampradāya is coming down from the four Kumāras. So Pṛthu Mahārāja was very respectful to the //sampradāya-ācāryas.// As it is said by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, //sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ:// a spiritual master, or the //paramparā-ācārya,// should be respected exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word //vidhivat// is significant in this verse. This means that Pṛthu Mahārāja also strictly followed the injunctions of the //śāstra// in receiving a spiritual master, or //ācārya,// of the transcendental disciplic succession. Whenever an //ācārya// is seen, one should immediately bow down before him. Pṛthu Mahārāja did this properly; therefore the words used here are //praśrayānata-kandharaḥ.// Out of humility, he bowed down before the Kumāras.
