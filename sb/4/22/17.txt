===== Translation =====

**The great sage Maitreya continued: Thus Sanat-kumāra, the best of the celibates, after hearing the speech of Pṛthu Mahārāja, which was meaningful, appropriate, full of precise words and very sweet to hear, smiled with full satisfaction and began to speak as follows.**

===== Purport =====

Pṛthu Mahārāja's talks before the Kumāras were very laudable because of so many qualifications. A speech should be composed of selected words, very sweet to hear and appropriate to the situation. Such speech is called meaningful. All these good qualifications are present in Pṛthu Mahārāja's speech because he is a perfect devotee. It is said, //yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ:// "For one who has unflinching devotional faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is engaged in His service, all good qualities become manifest in his person." [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]] Thus the Kumāras were very much pleased, and Sanat-kumāra began to speak as follows.
