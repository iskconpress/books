===== Purport =====

The Kumāras are described herein as the elder brothers of Lord Śiva. When the Kumāras were born out of the body of Lord Brahmā, they were requested to get married and increase the population. In the beginning of the creation there was a great need of population; therefore Lord Brahmā was creating one son after another and ordering them to increase. However, when the Kumāras were requested to do so, they declined. They wanted to remain //brahmacārī// throughout life and be engaged fully in the devotional service of the Lord. The Kumāras are called //naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī,// meaning they are never to marry. Because of their refusal to marry, Lord Brahmā became so angry that his eyes became reddish. From between his eyes, Lord Śiva, or Rudra, appeared. The mode of anger is consequently known as //rudra.// Lord Śiva also has a //sampradāya// party, known as the Rudra-sampradāya, and they are also known as Vaiṣṇavas.
