===== Purport =====

When something uncommon happens in one's progressive spiritual life, it should be understood to be incurred by //ajñāta-sukṛti,// or pious activities beyond one's knowledge. To see personally the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotee is not an ordinary incident. When such things happen, they should be understood to be caused by previous pious activity, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:28|(Bg. 7.28)]]: //yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// One who is completely freed from all the resultant actions of sinful activities and who is absorbed only in pious activities can engage in devotional service. Although Mahārāja Pṛthu's life was full of pious activities, he was wondering how his audience with the Kumāras happened. He could not imagine what kind of pious activities he had performed. This is a sign of humility on the part of King Pṛthu, whose life was so full of pious activities that even Lord Viṣṇu came to see him and predicted that the Kumāras would also come.
