**Throughout the whole universe---in the higher, lower and middle planetary systems---Pṛthu Mahārāja's reputation was loudly declared, and all ladies and saintly persons heard his glories, which were as sweet as the glories of Lord Rāmacandra.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the words //strīṇām// and //rāmaḥ// are significant. It is the practice amongst ladies to hear and enjoy the praises of certain heroes. From this verse it appears that Pṛthu Mahārāja's reputation was so great that ladies all over the universe would hear of it with great pleasure. At the same time, his glories were heard all over the universe by the devotees, and they were as pleasing as Lord Rāmacandra's glories. Lord Rāmacandra's kingdom is still existing, and recently there was a political party in India named the Rāmarājya party, which wanted to establish a kingdom resembling the kingdom of Rāma. Unfortunately, modern politicians want the kingdom of Rāma without Rāma Himself. Although they have banished the idea of God consciousness, they still expect to establish the kingdom of Rāma. Such a proposal is rejected by devotees. Pṛthu Mahārāja's reputation was heard by saintly persons because he exactly represented Lord Rāmacandra, the ideal king.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Pṛthu Mahārāja's Meeting With the Four Kumāras."
