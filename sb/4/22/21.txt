**It has been conclusively decided in the scriptures, after due consideration, that the ultimate goal for the welfare of human society is detachment from the bodily concept of life and increased and steadfast attachment for the Supreme Lord, who is transcendental, beyond the modes of material nature.**

===== Purport =====

Everyone in human society is engaged for the ultimate benefit of life, but persons who are in the bodily conception cannot achieve the ultimate goal, nor can they understand what it is. The ultimate goal of life is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:59|(Bg. 2.59)]]. //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.// When one finds out the supreme goal of life, he naturally becomes detached from the bodily concept. Here in this verse the indication is that one has to steadfastly increase attachment for the Transcendence (//brahmaṇi//). As confirmed in the //Vedānta-sūtra// (1.1.1), //athāto brahma jijñāsā:// without inquiry about the Supreme, or the Transcendence, one cannot give up attachment for this material world. By the evolutionary process in 8,400,000 species of life, one cannot understand the ultimate goal of life because in all those species of life, the bodily conception is very prominent. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā// means that in order to get out of the bodily conception, one has to increase attachment to or inquiry about Brahman. Then he can be situated in the transcendental devotional service---//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. To increase attachment for Brahman means to engage in devotional service. Those who are attached to the impersonal form of Brahman cannot remain attached for very long. Impersonalists, after rejecting this world as //mithyā,// or false (//jagan mithyā//), come down again to this //jagan mithyā,// although they take //sannyāsa// to increase their attachment for Brahman. Similarly, many //yogīs// who are attached to the localized aspect of Brahman as Paramātmā---great sages like Viśvāmitra---also fall down as victims of women. Therefore increased attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is advised in all //śāstras.// That is the only way of detachment from material existence and is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:59|(Bg. 2.59)]] as //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.// One can cease material activities when he actually has the taste for devotional service. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also recommended love of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life (//premā pum-artho mahān//). Without increasing love of Godhead, one cannot achieve the perfectional stage of the transcendental position.
