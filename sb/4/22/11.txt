===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //tīrtha-pādīya// indicates devotees of Lord Viṣṇu, or Vaiṣṇavas. As far as //brāhmaṇas// are concerned, in the previous verse the mode of reception has been already described. Now, in this verse, special stress is being given to the Vaiṣṇavas. Generally the //sannyāsīs,// or those in the renounced order of life, take trouble to enlighten the householders. There are //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsīs// and //tridaṇḍī sannyāsīs.// The //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsīs// are generally followers of Śaṅkarācārya and are known as Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// whereas the //tridaṇḍī sannyāsīs// are followers of Vaiṣṇava //ācāryas//---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya and so on---and they take trouble to enlighten the householders. //Ekadaṇḍī sannyāsīs// can be situated on the platform of pure Brahman because they are aware that the spirit soul is different from the body, but they are mainly impersonalists. The Vaiṣṇavas know that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person and that the Brahman effulgence is based on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:27|(Bg. 14.27)]]: //brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham.// The conclusion is that //tīrtha-pādīya// refers to Vaiṣṇavas. In the //Bhāgavatam// (1.13.10) there is also another reference: //tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni.// Wherever he goes, a Vaiṣṇava immediately makes that place a //tīrtha,// a place of pilgrimage. The Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs// travel all over the world to make every place a place of pilgrimage by the touch of their lotus feet. It is mentioned here that any house which does not receive a Vaiṣṇava in the manner already explained in the previous verse is to be considered the residential quarters of venomous serpents. It is said that around the sandalwood tree, which is a very valuable tree, there is a venomous serpent. Sandalwood is very cold, and venomous serpents, because of their poisonous teeth, are always very warm, and they take shelter of the sandalwood trees to become cooler. Similarly, there are many rich men who keep watchdogs or doormen and put up signs that say, "Do not enter," "Trespassers not allowed," "Beware of the dog," etc. Sometimes in Western countries a trespasser is shot, and there is no crime in such shooting. This is the position of demoniac householders, and such houses are considered to be the residential quarters of venomous snakes. The members of such families are no better than snakes because snakes are very much envious, and when that envy is directed to the saintly persons, their position becomes more dangerous. It is said by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita that there are two envious living entities---the snake and the envious man. The envious man is more dangerous than a snake because a snake can be subdued by charming //mantras// or by some herbs, but an envious person cannot be pacified by any means.
