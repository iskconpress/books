===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //ātma-medhasā// is commented upon by Śrīpāda Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, who says that //ātmani// means "unto Lord Kṛṣṇa, //paramātmani.//" ord Kṛṣṇa is Paramātmā. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// (Bs. 5.1). Therefore one whose mind is acting fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called //ātma-medhāḥ.// This may be contrasted to the word //gṛha-medhī,// which refers to one whose brain is always engrossed with thoughts of material activities. The //ātma-medhāḥ// is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa's activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Since Sanat-kumāra, who was a son of Lord Brahmā, was fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, he could point out the path of spiritual advancement. The word //ātma-gatiḥ// refers to that path of activities by which one can make progress in understanding Kṛṣṇa.
