===== Purport =====

In the material world everyone who comes to enjoy himself or lord it over material nature is envious of others. This envy is also found in the personality of the King of heaven, Indra. As evident from revealed scriptures, Indra was several times envious of many persons. He was especially envious of great fruitive activities and the execution of //yoga// practices, or //siddhis.// Indeed, he could not tolerate them, and he desired to break them up. He was envious due to fear that those who performed great sacrifices for the execution of mystic //yoga// might occupy his seat. Since no one in this material world can tolerate another's advancement, everyone in the material world is called //matsara,// envious. In the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is therefore said that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is meant for those who are completely //nirmatsara// (nonenvious). In other words, one who is not free from the contamination of envy cannot advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, if someone excels another person, the devotee who is excelled thinks how fortunate the other person is to be advancing in devotional service. Such nonenvy is typical of Vaikuṇṭha. However, when one is envious of his competitor, that is material. The demigods posted in the material world are not exempt from envy.
