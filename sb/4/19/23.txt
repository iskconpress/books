===== Translation =====

**Whatever different forms Indra assumed as a mendicant because of his desire to seize the horse were symbols of atheistic philosophy.**

===== Purport =====

According to Vedic civilization, //sannyāsa// is one of the essential items in the program of the //varṇa-āśrama// institution. One should accept //sannyāsa// according to the //paramparā// system of the //ācāryas.// At the present moment, however, many so-called //sannyāsīs// or mendicants have no understanding of God consciousness. Such //sannyāsa// was introduced by Indra because of his jealousy of Mahārāja Pṛthu, and what he introduced is again appearing in the age of Kali. practically none of the //sannyāsīs// in this age are bona fide. No one can introduce any new system into the Vedic way of life; if one does so out of malice, he is to be known as a //pāṣaṇḍī,// or atheist. In the Vaiṣṇava //Tantra// it is said:

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam
> [[books:cc:madhya:18:116|[Cc. Madhya 18.116]]]

Although it is forbidden, there are many //pāṣaṇḍīs// who coin terms like //daridra-nārāyaṇa// and //svāmi-nārāyaṇa,// although not even such demigods as Brahmā and Śiva can be equal to Nārāyaṇa.
