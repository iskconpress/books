Since time immemorial, the //sannyāsa// order has carried the //tridaṇḍa.// Later Śaṅkarācārya introduced the //ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsa.// A //tridaṇḍi-sannyāsī// is a Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī,// and an //ekadaṇḍi-sannyāsī// is a Māyāvādī //sannyāsī.// There are many other types of //sannyāsīs,// who are not approved by Vedic rituals. A type of pseudo-//sannyāsa// was introduced by Indra when he tried to hide himself from the attack of Vijitāśva, the great son of King Pṛthu. Now there are many different types of //sannyāsīs.// Some of them go naked, and some of them carry a skull and trident, generally known as //kāpālika.// All of them were introduced under some meaningless circumstances, and those who have a poor fund of knowledge accept these false //sannyāsīs// and their pretenses, although they are not bona fide guides to spiritual advancement. At the present moment some missionary institutions, without referring to the Vedic rituals, have introduced some //sannyāsīs// who engage in sinful activities. The sinful activities forbidden by the //śāstras// are illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. These so-called //sannyāsīs// indulge in all these activities. They eat meat and flesh, fish, eggs and just about everything. They sometimes drink with the excuse that without alcohol, fish and meat, it is impossible to remain in the cold countries near the Arctic zone. These //sannyāsīs// introduce all these sinful activities in the name of serving the poor, and consequently poor animals are cut to pieces and go into the bellies of these //sannyāsīs.// As described in the following verses, such //sannyāsīs// are //pākhaṇḍīs.// Vedic literature states that a person who puts Lord Nārāyaṇa on the level with Lord Śiva or Lord Brahmā immediately becomes a //pākhaṇḍī.// As stated in the //Purāṇas://

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam
> [[books:cc:madhya:18:116|[Cc. Madhya 18.116]]]

In Kali-yuga the //pākhaṇḍīs// are very prominent. However, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has tried to kill all these //pākhaṇḍīs// by introducing His //saṅkīrtana// movement. Those who take advantage of this //saṅkīrtana// movement of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness will be able to save themselves from the influence of these //pākhaṇḍīs.//
