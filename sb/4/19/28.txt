{{description>Dear King, Indra's powers are already reduced due to his attempt to impede the execution of your sacrifice. We shall call him by Vedic mantras which were never before used, and certainly he will come. Thus by the power of our mantra, we shall cast him into the fire because he is your enemy.}}

**Dear King, Indra's powers are already reduced due to his attempt to impede the execution of your sacrifice. We shall call him by Vedic mantras which were never before used, and certainly he will come. Thus by the power of our mantra, we shall cast him into the fire because he is your enemy.**

===== Purport =====

By chanting the Vedic //mantras// properly in a sacrifice, one can perform many wonderful things. In Kali-yuga, however, there are no qualified //brāhmaṇas// who can chant the //mantras// properly. Consequently no attempt should be made to perform such big sacrifices. In this age the only sacrifice recommended is the //saṅkīrtana// movement.
