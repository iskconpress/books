===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //sākṣāt// is significant. Pṛthu Mahārāja was a //śaktyāveśa-avatāra// incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu. Actually Pṛthu Mahārāja was a living entity, but he acquired specific powers from Lord Viṣṇu. Lord Viṣṇu, however, is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus belongs to the category of //viṣṇu-tattva.// Mahārāja Pṛthu belonged to the //jīva-tattva.// The //viṣṇu-tattva// indicates God, whereas the //jīva-tattva// indicates the part and parcel of God. When God's part and parcel is especially empowered, he is called //śaktyāveśa-avatāra.// Lord Viṣṇu is herein described as //harir īśvaraḥ.// The Lord is so kind that He takes all miserable conditions away from His devotees. Consequently He is called Hari. He is described as //īśvara// because He can do whatever He likes. He is the supreme controller. The supreme //īśvara puruṣottama// is Lord Kṛṣṇa. He exhibits His powers as //īśvara,// or the supreme controller, when He assures His devotee in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear." He can immediately make His devotee immune from all the reactions caused by sinful life if the devotee simply surrenders unto Him. He is described herein as //sarvātmā,// meaning that He is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul, and as such He is the supreme teacher of everyone. If we are fortunate enough to take the lessons given by Lord Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā,// our lives immediately become successful. No one can give better instructions to human society than Lord Kṛṣṇa.
