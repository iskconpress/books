===== Translation =====

**When the son of King Pṛthu was informed by Atri of King Indra's trick, he immediately became very angry and followed Indra to kill him, calling, "Wait! Wait!"**

===== Purport =====

The words //tiṣṭha tiṣṭha// are used by a //kṣatriya// when he challenges his enemy. When fighting, a //kṣatriya// cannot flee from the battlefield. However, when a //kṣatriya// out of cowardice flees from the battlefield, showing his back to his enemy, he is challenged with the words //tiṣṭha tiṣṭha.// A real //kṣatriya// does not kill his enemy from behind, nor does a real //kṣatriya// turn his back on the battlefield. According to //kṣatriya// principle and spirit, one either attains victory or dies on the battlefield. Although King Indra was very exalted, being the King of heaven, he became degraded due to his stealing the horse intended for sacrifice. Therefore he fled without observing the //kṣatriya// principles, and the son of Pṛthu had to challenge him with the words //tiṣṭha tiṣṭha.//
