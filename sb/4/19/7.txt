===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //dharma-dughā// is significant, for it indicates //kāma-dhenu. Kāma-dhenu// is also known as //surabhi. Surabhi// cows inhabit the spiritual world, and, as stated in //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Lord Kṛṣṇa is engaged in tending these cows: //surabhīr abhipālayantam// [Bs. 5.29]. One can milk a //surabhi// cow as often as one likes, and the cow will deliver as much milk as one requires. Milk, of course, is necessary for the production of so many milk products, especially clarified butter, which is required for the performance of great sacrifices. Unless we are prepared to perform the prescribed sacrifices, our supply of the necessities of life will be checked. //Bhagavad-gītā// confirms that Lord Brahmā created human society along with //yajña,// the performance of sacrifice. //Yajña// means Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sacrifice means working for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, however, it is very difficult to find qualified //brāhmaṇas// who can perform sacrifices as prescribed in the //Vedas.// Therefore it is recommended in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ//) that by performing //saṅkīrtana-yajña// and by satisfying the //yajña-puruṣa,// Lord Caitanya, one can derive all the results derived by great sacrifices in the past. King Pṛthu and others derived all the necessities of life from the earthly planet by performing great sacrifices. Now this //saṅkīrtana// movement has already been started by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. people should take advantage of this great sacrifice and join in the Society's activities; then there will be no scarcity. If //saṅkīrtana-yajña// is performed, there will be no difficulty, not even in industrial enterprises. Therefore this system should be introduced in all spheres of life---social, political, industrial, commercial, etc. Then everything will run very peacefully and smoothly.
