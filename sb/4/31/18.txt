~~bc:Text 18~~

{{description>Because the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, He is the Supersoul of all individual living entities, and He exists as both the remote and immediate cause. Since He is aloof from the material emanations, He is free from their interactions and is Lord of material nature. You should therefore engage in His devotional service, thinking yourself qualitatively one with Him.}}

===== Translation =====

**Because the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, He is the Supersoul of all individual living entities, and He exists as both the remote and immediate cause. Since He is aloof from the material emanations, He is free from their interactions and is Lord of material nature. You should therefore engage in His devotional service, thinking yourself qualitatively one with Him.**

===== Purport =====

According to Vedic calculations, there are three causes of creation---time, the ingredient and the creator. Combined, these are called //tritayātmaka,// the three causes. Everything in this material world is created by these three causes. All of these causes are found in the Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā: sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]. Nārada Muni therefore advises the Pracetās to worship the direct cause, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated before, when the root of a tree is watered, all the parts are energized. According to the advice of Nārada Muni, one should directly engage in devotional service. This will include all pious activity. //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// states, //kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya:// when one worships the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, in devotional service, one automatically performs all other pious activity. In this verse the words //sva-tejasā dhvasta-guṇa-pravāham// are very significant. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never affected by the material qualities, although they all emanate from His spiritual energy. Those who are really conversant with this knowledge can utilize everything for the service of the Lord because nothing in this material world is unconnected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
