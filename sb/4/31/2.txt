===== Translation =====

**The Pracetās went to the seashore in the west where the great liberated sage Jājali was residing. After perfecting the spiritual knowledge by which one becomes equal toward all living entities, the Pracetās became perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.**

===== Purport =====

The word //brahma-satra// means "cultivation of spiritual knowledge." Actually, both the //Vedas// and severe austerity are known as //brahma. Vedas tattvaṁ tapo brahma. Brahma// also means "the Absolute Truth." One has to cultivate knowledge of the Absolute Truth by pursuing studies in the //Vedas// and undergoing severe austerities and penances. The Pracetās properly executed this function and consequently became equal to all other living entities. As //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]] confirms:

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām

"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."

When one actually becomes spiritually advanced, he does not see the difference between one living entity and another. This platform is attained by determination. When perfect knowledge is expanded, one ceases to see the outward covering of the living entity. He sees, rather, the spirit soul within the body. Thus he does not make distinctions between a human being and an animal, a learned //brāhmaṇa// and a //caṇḍāla.//

> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śvapāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ

"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle //brāhmaṇa,// a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." [[books:bg:5:18|(Bg. 5.18)]]

A learned person sees everyone equally on a spiritual basis, and a learned person, a devotee, wants to see everyone developed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The place where the Pracetās were residing was perfect for executing spiritual activities, for it is indicated that the great sage Jājali attained //mukti// (liberation) there. One desiring perfection or liberation should associate with a person who is already liberated. This is called //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], associating with a perfect devotee.
