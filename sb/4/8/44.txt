===== Purport =====

In this verse the entire //yoga// system is described in summary, and special stress is given to the breathing exercises for stopping the disturbing mind. The mind, by nature, is always oscillating, for it is very fickle, but the breathing exercise is meant to control it. This process of controlling the mind might have been very possible in those days millions of years ago when Dhruva Mahārāja took to it, but at the present moment the mind has to be fixed directly on the lotus feet of the Lord by the chanting process. By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// one immediately concentrates on the sound vibration and thinks of the lotus feet of the Lord, and very quickly one is elevated to the position of //samādhi,// or trance. If one goes on chanting the holy names of the Lord, which are not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, naturally his mind becomes absorbed in thought of the Lord.

It is here recommended to Dhruva Mahārāja that he meditate on the supreme //guru,// or supreme spiritual master. The supreme spiritual master is Kṛṣṇa, who is therefore known as //caitya-guru.// This refers to the Supersoul, who is sitting in everyone's heart. He helps from within as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// and He sends the spiritual master, who helps from without. The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the //caitya-guru,// or the spiritual master sitting in everyone's heart.

The process by which we give up our thoughts of material things is called //pratyāhāra,// which entails being freed from all material thoughts and engagements. The word //abhidhyāyet,// which is used in this verse, indicates that unless one's mind is fixed, one cannot meditate. The conclusion, therefore, is that meditation means thinking of the Lord within. Whether one comes to that stage by the //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system or by the method recommended in the //śāstras// especially for this present age---to constantly chant the holy name of the Lord---the goal is to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
