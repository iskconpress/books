**One who meditates in this way, concentrating his mind upon the always auspicious form of the Lord, is very soon freed from all material contamination, and he does not come down from meditation upon the Lord.**

===== Purport =====

This fixed meditation is called //samādhi,// or trance. A person constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord cannot be deviated from meditating on the form of the Lord, as described herein. The //arcana-mārga,// or the devotional path prescribed in the //Pañcarātra// system of devotional service for worshiping the Deity in the temple, makes the devotee think constantly of the Lord; that is //samādhi,// or trance. One who practices in this way cannot deviate from the service of the Lord, and that makes him perfect in the mission of human life.
