===== Translation =====

**The great sage Nārada told Dhruva: My dear boy, you are only a little boy whose attachment is to sports and other frivolities. Why are you so affected by words insulting your honor?**

===== Purport =====

Ordinarily if a child is rebuked as a rascal or fool, he smiles and does not take such insulting words very seriously. Similarly, if words of honor are offered, he does not appreciate them. But in the case of Dhruva Mahārāja, the //kṣatriya// spirit was so strong that he could not tolerate a slight insult from his stepmother which injured his //kṣatriya// prestige.
