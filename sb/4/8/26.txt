===== Purport =====

The qualifications of the //kṣatriyas// are described in //Bhagavad-gīta.// Two important qualifications are to have a sense of prestige and not to flee from battle. It appears that the //kṣatriya// blood within the body of Dhruva Mahārāja was naturally very active. If the brahminical, //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// culture is maintained in a family, naturally the sons and grandsons inherit the spirit of the particular class. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, the //saṁskāra,// or the reformatory system, is maintained very rigidly. If one fails to observe the reformatory measures current in the family, one is immediately degraded to a lower standard of life.
