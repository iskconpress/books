===== Purport =====

Here in this verse the word //puruṣam// is very significant. The Lord is never female. He is always male (//puruṣa//). Therefore the impersonalist who imagines the Lord's form as that of a woman is mistaken. The Lord appears in female form if necessary, but His perpetual form is //puruṣa// because He is originally male. The feminine feature of the Lord is displayed by goddesses of fortune---Lakṣmī, Rādhārāṇī, Sītā, etc. All these goddesses of fortune are servitors of the Lord; they are not the Supreme, as falsely imagined by the impersonalist. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His Nārāyaṇa feature is always four handed. On the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, when Arjuna wanted to see His universal form, He showed this feature of four-handed Nārāyaṇa. Some devotees are of the opinion that Kṛṣṇa is an incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, but the //Bhāgavata// school says that Nārāyaṇa is a manifestation of Kṛṣṇa.
