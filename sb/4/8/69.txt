===== Purport =====

Here in this verse Nārada Muni has described Dhruva Mahārāja as //prabhu.// This word is applicable to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the spiritual master is addressed as Prabhupāda. //Prabhu// means "the Supreme Personality of Godhead," and //pāda// means "post." According to Vaiṣṇava philosophy, the spiritual master occupies the post of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or in other words he is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord. Dhruva Mahārāja is also described here as //prabhu// because he is an //ācārya// of the Vaiṣṇava school. Another meaning of //prabhu// is "master of the senses," just like the word //svāmī.// Another significant word is //suduṣkaram,// "very difficult to perform." What was the task that Dhruva Mahārāja undertook? The most difficult task in life is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Dhruva Mahārāja would be able to do that. We must remember that Dhruva Mahārāja was not fickle; he was determined to execute his service and then come back. Every devotee, therefore, should be determined that in this life he will be able to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by that process go back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of the highest mission of life.
