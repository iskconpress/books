===== Translation =====

**In the form of King Pṛthu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared through a part of His potency to protect the people of the world. The goddess of fortune is the constant companion of the Lord, and therefore she has incarnated partially as Arci to become King Pṛthu's queen.**

===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord says that whenever one sees an extraordinary power, he should conclude that a specific partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present. There are innumerable such personalities, but not all of them are direct //viṣṇu-tattva// plenary expansions of the Lord. Many living entities are classified among the //śakti-tattvas.// Such incarnations, empowered for specific purposes, are known as //śaktyāveśa-avatāras.// King Pṛthu was such a //śaktyāveśa-avatāra// of the Lord. Similarly, Arci, King Pṛthu's wife, was a //śaktyāveśa-avatāra// of the goddess of fortune.
