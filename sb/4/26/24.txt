===== Translation =====

**O hero's wife, kindly tell me if someone has offended you. I am prepared to give such a person punishment as long as he does not belong to the brāhmaṇa caste. But for the servant of Muraripu [Kṛṣṇa], I excuse no one within or beyond these three worlds. No one can freely move after offending you, for I am prepared to punish him.**

===== Purport =====

According to Vedic civilization, a //brāhmaṇa,// or one who is properly qualified to understand the Absolute Truth---that is, one belonging to the most intelligent social order---as well as the devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Muradviṣa, enemy of a demon named Mura, is not subject to the rules and regulations of the state. In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas. //Brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas never transgress the laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the king. This instruction was given to King Prācīnabarhiṣat by Nārada Muni. King Purañjana was a representative of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, and Nārada Muni was reminding King Prācīnabarhiṣat of his forefather, Mahārāja Pṛthu, who never chastised a //brāhmaṇa// or a Vaiṣṇava.

One's pure intelligence, or pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, becomes polluted by material activities. Pure consciousness can be revived by the process of sacrifice, charity, pious activities, etc., but when one pollutes his Kṛṣṇa consciousness by offending a //brāhmaṇa// or a Vaiṣṇava, it is very difficult to revive. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has described the //vaiṣṇava-aparādha,// or offense to a Vaiṣṇava, as "the mad elephant offense." One should be very careful not to offend a Vaiṣṇava or a //brāhmaṇa.// Even the great //yogī// Durvāsā was harassed by the Sudarśana //cakra// when he offended the Vaiṣṇava Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, who was neither a //brāhmaṇa// nor a //sannyāsī// but an ordinary householder. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was a Vaiṣṇava, and consequently Durvāsā Muni was chastised.

The conclusion is that if Kṛṣṇa consciousness is covered by material sins, one can eliminate the sins simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// but if one pollutes his Kṛṣṇa consciousness by offending a //brāhmaṇa// or a Vaiṣṇava, one cannot revive it until one properly atones for the sin by pleasing the offended Vaiṣṇava or //brāhmaṇa.// This was the course that Durvāsā Muni had to follow, for he surrendered unto Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. A //vaiṣṇava-aparādha// cannot be atoned for by any means other than by begging the pardon of the offended Vaiṣṇava.
