===== Translation =====

**Under the circumstances, the elder brother of Yavana-rāja, known as Prajvāra, set fire to the city to please his younger brother, whose other name is fear itself.**

===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic system, a dead body is set on fire, but before death there is another fire, or fever, which is called //prajvāra,// or //viṣṇu-jvāra.// Medical science verifies that when one's temperature is raised to 107 degrees, a man immediately dies. This //prajvāra,// or higher fever, at the last stage of life places the living entity in the midst of a blazing fire.
