===== Purport =====

Good intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]:

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te

"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me."

One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetās, the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is the way of the //paramparā// system. If we follow the //ācāryas,// we attain the same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like Arjuna, who formerly heard //Bhagavad-gītā// directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people argue that since Kṛṣṇa is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// and reading it, as long as one accepts //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, spoken by the Lord. However, if one wants to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// by his imperfect interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of //Bhagavad-gītā,// even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estimation.
