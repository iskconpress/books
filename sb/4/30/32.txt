===== Purport =====

When a devotee is actually engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, his engagement in itself is so perfect that there is no need to ask for further benediction. When a bee approaches the //pārijāta// tree, it gets unlimited supplies of honey. There is no need to go to another tree. If one is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is unlimited transcendental bliss, and as such there is no need to ask for further benediction. The //pārijāta// tree is not commonly found within this material world. The //pārijāta// tree is also known as //kalpa-vṛkṣa,// or the wish-fulfilling tree. One can get anything he desires from such a tree. In the material world, one can get oranges from an orange tree or mangoes from a mango tree, but there is no possibility of getting oranges from a mango tree or vice versa. However, one can get whatever he wants from the //pārijāta// tree---oranges, mangoes, bananas and so on. This tree is found in the spiritual world. //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu// [Bs. 5.29]. The spiritual world, //cintāmaṇi-dhāma,// is surrounded by these //kalpa-vṛkṣa// trees, but the //pārijāta// tree is also found in the kingdom of Indra, that is, on Indra's heavenly planet. This //pārijāta// tree was brought by Kṛṣṇa to please Satyabhāmā, one of His queens, and this tree was implanted in the Dvārakā mansions constructed for the queens. The lotus feet of the Lord are exactly like the //pārijāta// trees, or wish-fulfilling trees, and the devotees are like bumblebees. They are always attracted by the lotus feet of the Lord.
