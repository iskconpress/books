===== Translation =====

**The great sage Maitreya said: The sons of King Prācīnabarhi, known as the Pracetās, underwent severe austerities within the seawater to carry out the order of their father. By chanting and repeating the mantras given by Lord Śiva, they were able to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

One can offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, but if one repeats the prayers offered by great devotees like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, or if one follows in the footsteps of great personalities, one can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. For instance, we sometimes chant this //mantra// of //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.29):

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of //lakṣmīs,// or //gopīs.//" ecause this prayer was offered by Lord Brahmā, we follow him by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord Śiva to the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracetās, who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord.

Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as //purañjana.// According to Madhvācārya, the living entity is called //purañjana// because he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and under the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (//pura//), and He also enters within it. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. The Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom; therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called //purañjana.// One //purañjana,// the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme //purañjana;// therefore the duty of the subordinate //purañjana// is to satisfy the supreme //purañjana.// That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord Śiva, is the original //ācārya// of the Vaiṣṇava //sampradāya// called the Rudra-sampradāya. //Rudra-gītena// indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra, the Pracetās achieved spiritual success.
