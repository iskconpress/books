===== Purport =====

According to Vedic principles, a woman cannot have many husbands, although a husband can have many wives. In special instances, however, it is found that a woman has more than one husband. Draupadī, for instance, was married to all of the five Pāṇḍava brothers. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered all the sons of Prācīnabarhiṣat to marry the one girl born of the great sage Kaṇḍu and Pramlocā. In special cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able to treat her husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman. Only one who is especially qualified can be allowed to marry more than one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very difficult. Thus according to scripture, //kalau pañca vivarjayet.// In this age a woman is forbidden to marry her husband's brother. This system is still practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says: //apṛthag-dharma-śīleyaṁ bhūyāt patny arpitāśayā.// With the blessings of the Lord, all things are possible. The Lord especially blessed the girl to surrender equally to all brothers. //Apṛthag-dharma,// meaning "occupational duty without difference of purpose," is taught in //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is divided into three primary divisions-//karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga// and //bhakti-yoga.// The word //yoga// means "acting on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." As confirmed by //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]]:

> yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra
> loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ
> tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara

"Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage."

One may act according to his own occupational duty just to satisfy the //yajña-puruṣa,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is called //apṛthag-dharma.// Different limbs of the body may act in different ways, but the ultimate objective is to maintain the entire body. Similarly, if we work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that we satisfy everything. We should follow in the footsteps of the Pracetās, whose only aim was to satisfy the Supreme Lord. This is called //apṛthag-dharma.// According to //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]], //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This is the advice of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Our only aim should be to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the satisfaction of the Lord. This is oneness, or //apṛthag-dharma.//
