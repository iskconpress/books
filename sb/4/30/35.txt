===== Purport =====

//Vaikuṇṭha// means "without anxiety," and the material world means full of anxiety. As stated by Prahlāda Mahārāja: //sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. The living entities who have accepted this material world as a residence are full of anxiety. A place immediately becomes Vaikuṇṭha whenever the holy topics of the Personality of Godhead are discussed by pure devotees. This is the process of //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]], chanting and hearing about the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu. As the Supreme Lord Himself confirms:

> nāhaṁ tiṣṭhāmi vaikuṇṭhe
> yogināṁ hṛdayeṣu vā
> tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada
> yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ

"My dear Nārada, actually I do not reside in My abode, Vaikuṇṭha, nor do I reside within the hearts of the //yogīs,// but I reside in that place where My pure devotees chant My holy name and discuss My form, pastimes and qualities." Because of the presence of the Lord in the form of the transcendental vibration, the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere is evoked. This atmosphere is without fear and anxiety. One living entity does not fear another. By hearing the holy names and glories of the Lord, a person executes pious activities. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|(SB 1.2.17)]]. Thus his material hankerings immediately stop. This //saṅkīrtana// movement started by the Society for Krishna Consciousness is meant for creating Vaikuṇṭha, the transcendental world that is without anxiety, even in this material world. The method is the propagation of the //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]] process throughout the world. In the material world everyone is envious of his fellow man. Animalistic envy exists in human society as long as there is no performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// the chanting of the holy names---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The Pracetās therefore decided to remain always in the society of devotees, and they considered that to be the highest benediction possible in human life.
