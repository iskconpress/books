===== Purport =====

In this verse Vidura is addressed as //rājan,// which means "O King." In this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments that a //dhīra// never becomes angry because he is always situated in devotional service. Advanced devotees can control their senses; therefore a devotee can be addressed as //rājan.// A king controls and rules in various ways among citizens; similarly, one who can control his senses is the king of his senses. He is a //svāmī// or //gosvāmī.// The //svāmīs// and //gosvāmīs// are therefore sometimes addressed as //mahārāja,// or king.
