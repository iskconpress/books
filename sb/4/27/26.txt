===== Purport =====

Yavana-rāja, the King of the Yavanas, could also refuse to accept Kālakanyā, daughter of Time, but he considered the request due to the order of Nārada Muni. Thus he accepted Kālakanyā in a different way. In other words, the injunctions of Nārada Muni, or the path of devotional service, can be accepted by anyone within the three worlds, and certainly by the King of the Yavanas. Lord Caitanya Himself requested everyone to preach the cult of //bhakti-yoga// all over the world, in every village and town. Preachers in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have actually experienced that even the //yavanas// and //mlecchas// have taken to spiritual life on the strength of Nārada Muni's //pāñcarātrika-vidhi.// When mankind follows the disciplic succession, as recommended by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, everyone throughout the world will benefit.
