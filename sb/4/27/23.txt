===== Purport =====

Being the most perfect Vaiṣṇava, Śrī Nārada Muni is always willing to do good to others, even to one who curses him. Although Kālakanyā, the daughter of Time, was refused by Nārada Muni, she was given a shelter. Of course no one could give her shelter, but a Vaiṣṇava gives shelter somewhere to such an unfortunate girl. When //jarā,// or old age, attacks, everyone dwindles and deteriorates. In one stroke Nārada Muni gave shelter to Kālakanyā and counterattacked the ordinary //karmīs.// If one accepts the instructions of Nārada Muni, the ocean of fear (//bhaya//) can be very quickly removed by the grace of that great Vaiṣṇava.
