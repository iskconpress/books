===== Purport =====

The great sage Nārada Muni was a //naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī//---that is, he never had sex life. He was consequently an ever-green youth. Old age, //jarā,// could not attack him. The invalidity of old age can overcome an ordinary man, but Nārada Muni was different. Taking Nārada Muni to be an ordinary man, the daughter of Time confronted him with her lusty desire. It requires great strength to resist a woman's attraction. It is difficult for old men, and what to speak of young. Those who live as //brahmacārīs// must follow in the footsteps of the great sage Nārada Muni, who never accepted the proposals of Jarā. Those who are too much sexually addicted become victims of //jarā,// and very soon their life-span is shortened. Without utilizing the human form of life for Kṛṣṇa consciousness the victims of //jarā// die very soon in this world.
