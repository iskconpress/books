===== Translation =====

**Then Vīrabhadra saw the wooden device in the sacrificial arena by which the animals were to have been killed. He took the opportunity of this facility to behead Dakṣa.**

===== Purport =====

In this connection it is to be noted that the device used for killing animals in the sacrifice was not designed to facilitate eating their flesh. The killing was specifically intended to give a new life to the sacrificed animal by the power of Vedic //mantra.// The animals were sacrificed to test the strength of Vedic //mantras; yajñas// were performed as a test of the //mantra.// Even in the modern age, tests are executed on animal bodies in the physiology laboratory. Similarly, whether or not the //brāhmaṇas// were uttering the Vedic hymns correctly was tested by sacrifice in the arena. On the whole, the animals thus sacrificed were not at all the losers. Some old animals would be sacrificed, but in exchange for their old bodies they received other, new bodies. That was the test of Vedic //mantras.// Vīrabhadra, instead of sacrificing animals with the wooden device, immediately beheaded Dakṣa, to the astonishment of everyone.
