During the life of Svāyambhuva Manu, six kinds of living entities were generated from the demigods known as the Tuṣitas, from the sages headed by Marīci, and from descendants of Yajña, king of the demigods, and all of them expanded their progeny to observe the order of the Lord to fill the universe with living entities. These six kinds of living entities are known as //manus, devas, manu-putras, aṁśāvatāras, sureśvaras// and //ṛṣis.// Yajña, being the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became the leader of the demigods, Indra.
