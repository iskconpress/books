**The reason is that Satī's father, Dakṣa, used to rebuke Lord Śiva in spite of Śiva's faultlessness. Consequently, before attaining a mature age, Satī gave up her body by dint of yogic mystic power.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Śiva, being the head of all mystic //yogīs,// never even constructed a home for his residence. Sati was the daughter of a great king, Dakṣa, and because his youngest daughter, Sati, selected as her husband Lord Śiva, King Dakṣa was not very much satisfied with her. Therefore whenever she met her father, he unnecessarily criticized her husband, although Lord Śiva was faultless. Because of this, before attaining a mature age Sati gave up the body given by her father, Dakṣa, and therefore she could not produce a child.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, First Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Genealogical Table of the Daughters of Manu."
