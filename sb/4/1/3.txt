===== Purport =====

The word //brahma-varcasvī// is very significant. Ruci was a //brāhmaṇa,// and he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as //brahma-varcasvī.// One who is born of a //brāhmaṇa// father but does not act as a //brāhmaṇa// is called, in Vedic language, a //brahma-bandhu,// and is calculated to be on the level of //śūdras// and women. Thus in the //Bhāgavatam// we find that //Mahābhārata// was specifically compiled by Vyāsadeva for //strī-śūdra-brahma-bandhu// [[books:sb:1:4:25|[SB 1.4.25]]]. //Strī// means women, //śūdra// means the lower class of civilized human society, and //brahma-bandhu// means persons who are born in the families of //brāhmaṇas// but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent; they have no access to the study of the //Vedas,// which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications. This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualification. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and other //purāṇas,// for such persons cannot deliver their real message. Ruci was considered a first-class //brāhmaṇa;// therefore he is mentioned here as //brahma-varcasvī,// one who had full prowess in brahminical strength.
