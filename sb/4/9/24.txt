===== Purport =====

The most important factor in this verse is the Lord's instructions regarding how to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead at the end of life. //Ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ:// [[books:sb:2:1:6|[SB 2.1.6]]] the result of whatever we do in executing spiritual activities is successful if we can remember Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This program of constant remembrance can be disturbed by many things, but Dhruva Mahārāja's life would be so pure, as assured by the Lord Himself, that Dhruva would never forget Him. Thus at the time of his death he would remember the Supreme Lord, and before his death he would enjoy this material world, not by sense gratification, but by performing great sacrifices. As stated in the //Vedas,// when one performs great sacrifices he must give charity, not only to the //brāhmaṇas,// but also to the //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// It is assured here that Dhruva Mahārāja would be able to perform such activities. In this age of Kali, however, the great sacrifice is the performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is designed to teach people (and to learn ourselves) the exact instruction of the Personality of Godhead. In this way we shall continuously perform the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// and continuously chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Then at the end of our lives we shall certainly be able to remember Kṛṣṇa, and our program of life will be successful. In this age, distribution of //prasāda// has replaced distribution of money. No one has sufficient money to distribute, but if we distribute //kṛṣṇa-prasāda// as far as possible, this is more valuable than the distribution of money.
