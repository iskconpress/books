===== Translation =====

**The great sage Maitreya said: After being worshiped and honored by the boy, Dhruva Mahārāja, and after offering him His abode, Lord Viṣṇu, on the back of Garuḍa, returned to His abode, as Dhruva Mahārāja looked on.**

===== Purport =====

From this verse it appears that Lord Viṣṇu awarded Dhruva Mahārāja the same abode in which He resides. His abode is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:6|(Bg. 15.6)]]: //yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama.//
