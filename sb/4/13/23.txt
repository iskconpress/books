===== Purport =====

According to Vedic civilization the king is supposed to be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is called //nara-nārāyaṇa,// indicating that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in human society as the king. It is etiquette that neither a //brāhmaṇa// nor a //kṣatriya// king is ever insulted by the citizens; even though a king appears to be sinful, the citizens should not insult him. But in the case of Vena it appears that he was cursed by the //nara-devatās;// therefore, it was concluded that his sinful activities were very grievous.
