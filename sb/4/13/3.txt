**Vidura continued: I know that the great sage Nārada is the greatest of all devotees. He has compiled the pāñcarātrika procedure of devotional service and has directly met the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

There are two different ways of approaching the Supreme Lord. One is called //bhāgavata-mārga,// or the way of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and the other is called //pāñcarātrika-vidhi. Pāñcarātrika-vidhi// is the method of temple worship, and //bhāgavata-vidhi// is the system of nine processes which begin with hearing and chanting. The Kṛṣṇa conscious movement accepts both processes simultaneously and thus enables one to make steady progress on the path of realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This //pāñcarātrika// procedure was first introduced by the great sage Nārada, as referred to here by Vidura.
