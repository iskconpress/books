===== Purport =====

The symptoms and characteristics of Utkala, the son of Mahārāja Dhruva, are those of a //mahā-bhāgavata.// As stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:30|(Bg. 6.30)]], //yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati:// a highly advanced devotee sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere, and he also sees everything resting in the Supreme. It is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]], //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:// Lord Kṛṣṇa is spread all over the universe in His impersonal feature. Everything is resting on Him, but that does not mean that everything is He Himself. A highly advanced //mahā-bhāgavata// devotee sees in this spirit: he sees the same Supersoul, Paramātmā, existing within everyone's heart, regardless of discrimination based on the different material forms of the living entities. He sees everyone as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //mahā-bhāgavata,// who experiences the Supreme Godhead's presence everywhere, is never missing from the sight of the Supreme Lord, nor is the Supreme Lord ever lost from his sight. This is possible only when one is advanced in love of Godhead.
