===== Translation =====

**Two eyes, two nostrils and a mouth---all together five---are situated in the front. The right ear is accepted as the southern gate, and the left ear is the northern gate. The two holes, or gates, situated in the west are known as the rectum and genital.**

===== Purport =====

Of all sides, the eastern is considered most important, primarily because the sun rises from that direction. The gates on the eastern side---the eyes, nose and mouth---are thus very important gates in the body.
