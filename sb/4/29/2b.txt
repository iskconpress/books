===== Translation =====

**Everything happening within time, which consists of past, present and future, is merely a dream. That is the secret understanding in all Vedic literature.**

===== Purport =====

Factually all of material existence is only a dream. Thus there is no question of past, present or future. Persons who are addicted to //karma-kāṇḍa-vicāra,// which means "working for future happiness through fruitive activities," are also dreaming. Similarly, past happiness and present happiness are merely dreams. The actual reality is Kṛṣṇa and service to Kṛṣṇa, which can save us from the clutches of //māyā,// for the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]], //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:// "Those who surrender unto Me can easily cross beyond My illusory energy."

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Talks Between Nārada and King Prācīnabarhi."
