Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme enjoyer. When a living entity wants to imitate Him, he is given a chance to satisfy his false desire to lord it over material nature. That is the beginning of his downfall. As long as he is within this material atmosphere, he has a subtle vehicle in the form of the mind, which is the stockpile of all kinds of material desires. Such desires become manifest in different bodily forms. Śrīla Nārada Muni requests the King to accept this fact from him because Nārada is an authority. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of our past desires, and we have this present body due to our past desires. Similarly, whatever we desire in this present body will be expressed in a future body. Thus the mind is the source of different kinds of bodies.

If the mind is purified by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one will naturally in the future get a body that is spiritual and full of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such a body is our original form, as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms, //jīvera 'svarūpa' haya-kṛṣṇera 'nitya-dāsa':// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]] "Every living entity is constitutionally an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa." If a person is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, he is to be considered a liberated soul even in this life. This is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:

> īhā yasya harer dāsye
> karmaṇā manasā girā
> nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
> jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate

"One who engages in the transcendental service of the Lord in body, mind and words is to be considered liberated in all conditions of material existence." (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.187) The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on this principle. We must teach people to absorb themselves always in the service of the Lord because that position is their natural position. One who is always serving the Lord is to be considered already liberated. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]:

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena sevate
> sa guṇān samatityaitān
> brahma-bhuyāya kalpate

"One who always engages in the spiritual activities of unalloyed devotional service at once transcends the modes of material nature and is elevated to the spiritual platform." The devotee is therefore above the three modes of material nature and is even transcendental to the //brāhmaṇa// platform. A //brāhmaṇa// may be infected by the two baser modes---namely //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// A pure devotee, who is free from all material desires experienced on the mental platform and who is also free from empiric philosophical speculation or fruitive activity, is always above material conditioning and is always liberated.
