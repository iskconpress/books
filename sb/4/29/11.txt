===== Purport =====

The word //avadhūta// means "most free." A person is not under the rules and regulations of any injunction when he has attained the stage of //avadhūta.// In other words, he can act as he likes. This //avadhūta// stage is exactly like air, which does not care for any obstruction. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:34|(Bg. 6.34)]] it is said:

> cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa
> pramāthi balavad dṛḍham
> tasyāhaṁ nigrahaṁ manye
> vāyor iva suduṣkaram

"The mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kṛṣṇa, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind."

Just as the air or wind cannot be checked by anyone, the two nostrils, situated in one place, enjoy the sense of smell without impediment. When the tongue is present, the mouth continually tastes all kinds of relishable foodstuffs.
