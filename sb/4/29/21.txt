===== Translation =====

**What was previously explained as Caṇḍavega, powerful time, is covered by days and nights, named Gandharvas and Gandharvīs. The body's life-span is gradually reduced by the passage of days and nights, which number 360.**

===== Purport =====

The word //parikrāntyā// means "by traveling." The living entity travels on his chariot day and night during a year consisting of 360 (or more) days and nights. Life's progress is taken for the unnecessary labor required to cover these 360 days and nights of life.
