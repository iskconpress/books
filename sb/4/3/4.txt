===== Purport =====

In any auspicious ceremony, such as a marriage ceremony, sacrificial ceremony or //pūjā// ceremony, it is auspicious for married women to decorate themselves very nicely with ornaments, fine clothing and cosmetics. These are auspicious signs. Many heavenly women assembled with their husbands, the //devarṣis,// demigods and //rājarṣis,// in that great sacrifice named //bṛhaspati-sava.// It is specifically mentioned in this verse that they approached with their husbands, for when a woman is decorated nicely, her husband becomes more cheerful. The nice decorations, ornaments and dress of the wives of the demigods and sages and the cheerfulness of the demigods and sages themselves were all auspicious signs for the ceremony.
