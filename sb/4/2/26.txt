===== Purport =====

The third curse inflicted by Nandīśvara on the //brāhmaṇas// who supported Dakṣa is completely functioning in the age of Kali. The so-called //brāhmaṇas// are no longer interested in understanding the nature of the Supreme Brahman, although a //brāhmaṇa// means one who has attained knowledge about Brahman. In the //Vedānta-sūtra// also it is stated, //athāto brahma jijñāsā:// this human form of life is meant for realization of the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth, or, in other words, human life is meant for one's elevation to the post of a //brāhmaṇa.// Unfortunately the modern //brāhmaṇas,// or so-called //brāhmaṇas// who come in originally brahminical families, have left their own occupational duties, but they do not allow others to occupy the posts of //brāhmaṇas.// The qualifications for //brāhmaṇas// are described in the scriptures, in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā// and all other Vedic literatures. //Brāhmaṇa// is not a hereditary title or position. If someone from a non-//brāhmaṇa// family (for example, one born in a family of //śūdras//) tries to become a //brāhmaṇa// by being properly qualified under the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, these so-called //brāhmaṇas// will object. Such //brāhmaṇas,// having been cursed by Nandīśvara, are actually in a position where they have no discrimination between eatables and noneatables and simply live to maintain the perishable material body and its family. Such fallen conditioned souls are not worthy to be called //brāhmaṇas,// but in Kali-yuga they claim to be //brāhmaṇas,// and if a person actually tries to attain the brahminical qualifications, they try to hinder his progress. This is the situation in the present age. Caitanya Mahāprabhu condemned this principle very strongly. During His conversation with Rāmānanda Rāya, He said that regardless of whether a person is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family or //śūdra// family, regardless of whether he is a householder or a //sannyāsī,// if he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa he must be a spiritual master. Caitanya Mahāprabhu had many so-called //śūdra// disciples like Haridāsa Ṭhākura and Rāmānanda Rāya. Even the Gosvāmīs, who were principal students of Lord Caitanya, were also ostracized from //brāhmaṇa// society, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by His grace, made them first-class Vaiṣṇavas.
