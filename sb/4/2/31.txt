===== Purport =====

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has claimed that He is the father of all living entities, regardless of form. There are 8,400,000 different species of life forms, and Lord Kṛṣṇa claims that He is the father of all. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are all sons of the Lord, and for their benefit, because they are hovering under the impression that they can lord it over material nature, the //Vedas// are given to them for their guidance. Therefore the //Vedas// are called //apauruṣeya,// for they are not written by any man or demigod, including the first living creature, Brahmā. Brahmā is not the creator or author of the //Vedas.// He is also one of the living beings in this material world; therefore he does not have the power to write or speak the //Vedas// independently. Every living entity within this material world is subject to four deficiencies: he commits mistakes, he accepts one thing for another, he cheats, and he has imperfect senses. The //Vedas,// however, are not written by any living creature within this material world. Therefore they are said to be //apauruṣeya.// No one can trace out the history of the //Vedas.// Of course, modern human civilization has no chronological history of the world or the universe, and it cannot present actual historical facts older than three thousand years. But no one has traced out when the //Vedas// were written, because they were never written by any living being within this material world. All other systems of knowledge are defective because they have been written or spoken by men or demigods who are products of this material creation, but //Bhagavad-gītā// is //apauruṣeya,// for it was not spoken by any human being or any demigod of this material creation; it was spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is beyond the material creation. That is accepted by such stalwart scholars as Śaṅkarācārya, not to speak of other //ācāryas// such as Rāmānujācārya and Madhvācārya. Śaṅkarācārya has accepted that Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa are transcendental, and in //Bhagavad-gītā// also Lord Kṛṣṇa has established, //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]] "I am the origin of everything; everything emanates from Me." This material creation, including Brahmā and Śiva and all the demigods, has been created by Him, for everything has emanated from Him. He also says that the purpose of all the //Vedas// is to understand Him (//vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]). He is the original //veda-vit,// or knower of the //Vedas,// and //vedānta-kṛt,// or compiler of //Vedānta.// Brahmā is not the compiler of the //Vedas.//

In the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is established, //tene brahma hṛdā:// the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, instructed Brahmā in the Vedic knowledge through his heart. Therefore the evidence that Vedic knowledge is free from the defects of mistakes, illusions, cheating and imperfection is that it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janārdana, and has thus been followed from time immemorial, beginning from Brahmā. The Vedic religion or the principles of the //Vedas// have been followed by the highly cultured population of India since time immemorial; no one can trace out the history of Vedic religion. Therefore it is //sanātana,// and any blasphemy against the //Vedas// is calculated to be atheism. The //Vedas// are described as //setu,// which means "a bridge." If one wants to attain his spiritual existence, one has to cross an ocean of nescience. The //Vedas// are the bridge by which to cross such a great ocean.

The //Vedas// describe how to divide the human race into four divisions according to quality and working capacity. This is a very scientific system, and it is also //sanātana,// for no one can trace out its history and it has no dissolution. No one can stop the system of //varṇa// and //āśrama,// or the castes and divisions. For example, whether or not one accepts the name //brāhmaṇa,// there is a class in society which is known as the intelligent class and which is interested in spiritual understanding and philosophy. Similarly, there is a class of men who are interested in administration and in ruling others. In the Vedic system these martially spirited men are called //kṣatriyas.// Similarly, everywhere there is a class of men who are interested in economic development, business, industry and money-making; they are called //vaiśyas.// And there is another class who are neither intelligent nor martially spirited nor endowed with the capacity for economic development but who simply can serve others. They are called //śūdras,// or the laborer class. This system is //sanātana//---it comes from time immemorial, and it will continue in the same way. There is no power in the world which can stop it. Therefore, since this //sanātana-dharma// system is eternal, one can elevate himself to the highest standard of spiritual life by following the Vedic principles.

It is stated that formerly the sages followed this system; therefore to follow the Vedic system is to follow the standard etiquette of society. But the followers of Lord Śiva, who are drunkards, who are addicted to intoxicants and sex life, who do not bathe and who smoke //gāñjā,// are against all human etiquette. The conclusion is that persons who rebel against the Vedic principles are themselves the evidence that the //Vedas// are authoritative, because by not following the Vedic principles they become like animals. Such animalistic persons are themselves evidence of the supremacy of the Vedic regulations.
