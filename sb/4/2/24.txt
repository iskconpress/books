===== Purport =====

The three curses mentioned above are sufficient to make one as dull as stone, void of spiritual knowledge and preoccupied with materialistic education, which is nescience. After uttering these curses, Nandīśvara then cursed the //brāhmaṇas// to continue in the cycle of birth and death because of their supporting Dakṣa in blaspheming Lord Śiva.
