===== Purport =====

Bhṛgu Muni, in cursing Nandīśvara, said that not only would they be degraded as atheists because of this curse, but they had already fallen to the standard of atheism because they had blasphemed the //Vedas,// which are the source of human civilization. Human civilization is based on the qualitative divisions of social order, namely the intelligent class, the martial class, the productive class and the laborer class. The //Vedas// provide the right direction for advancing in spiritual cultivation and economic development and regulating the principle of sense gratification, so that ultimately one may be liberated from material contamination to his real state of spiritual identification (//ahaṁ brahmāsmi//). As long as one is in the contamination of material existence, one changes bodies from the aquatics up to the position of Brahmā, but the human form of life is the highest perfectional life in the material world. The //Vedas// give directions by which to elevate oneself in the next life. The //Vedas// are the mother for such instructions, and the //brāhmaṇas,// or persons who are in knowledge of the //Vedas,// are the father. Thus if one blasphemes the //Vedas// and //brāhmaṇas,// naturally one goes down to the status of atheism. The exact word used in Sanskrit is //nāstika,// which refers to one who does not believe in the //Vedas// but manufactures some concocted system of religion. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that the followers of the Buddhist system of religion are //nāstikas.// In order to establish his doctrine of nonviolence, Lord Buddha flatly refused to believe in the //Vedas,// and thus, later on, Śaṅkarācārya stopped this system of religion in India and forced it to go outside India. Here it is stated, //brahma ca brāhmaṇān. Brahma// means the //Vedas. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi// means "I am in full knowledge." The Vedic assertion is that one should think that he is Brahman, for actually he is Brahman. If //brahma,// or the Vedic spiritual science, is condemned, and the masters of the spiritual science, the //brāhmaṇas,// are condemned, then where does human civilization stand? Bhṛgu Muni said, "It is not due to my cursing that you shall become atheists; you are already situated in the principle of atheism. Therefore you are condemned."
