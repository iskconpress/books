===== Translation =====

**Those who vow to worship Lord Śiva are so foolish that they imitate him by keeping long hair on their heads. When initiated into worship of Lord Śiva, they prefer to live on wine, flesh and other such things.**

===== Purport =====

Indulging in wine and meat, keeping long hair on one's head, not bathing daily, and smoking //gāñjā// (marijuana) are some of the habits which are accepted by foolish creatures who do not have regulated lives. By such behavior one becomes devoid of transcendental knowledge. In the initiation into the Śiva //mantra// there are //mudrikāṣṭaka,// in which it is sometimes recommended that one make his sitting place on the vagina and thus desire //nirvāṇa,// or dissolution of existence. In that process of worship, wine is needed, or sometimes, in place of wine, palm tree juice which is converted into an intoxicant. This is also offered according to //Śiva-āgama,// a scripture on the method of worshiping Lord Śiva.
