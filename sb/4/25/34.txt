===== Purport =====

This lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called ignorance. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:5:5|(5.5.5)]] it is called //parābhavas tāvad abodha jātaḥ.// Everyone is born ignorant. The //Bhāgavatam// therefore says that we are all born ignorant within this material world. In our ignorance we may create nationalism, philanthropy, internationalism, science, philosophy and so many other things. The basic principle behind all these is ignorance. What then is the value of all this advancement of knowledge if the basic principle is ignorance? Unless a person comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all of his activities are defeated. This human form of life is especially meant to dissipate ignorance, but without understanding how to dissipate ignorance people are planning and building many things. After death, however, all of this is finished.
