===== Purport =====

The two gates named Nalinī and Nālinī are the two nostrils. The living entity enjoys these two gates with the help of different //avadhūtas,// or airs, which constitute the breathing process. Through these gates the living entity goes to the town of Saurabha, or aroma. In other words, the nostrils, with the help of their friend the air, enjoy various aromas in the material world. Nalinī and Nālinī are the pipes of the nostrils, through which one inhales and exhales, enjoying the aroma of sense pleasure.
