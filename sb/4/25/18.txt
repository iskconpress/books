===== Translation =====

**The branches of the trees standing on the bank of the lake received particles of water carried by the spring air from the falls coming down from the icy mountain.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //hima-nirjhara// is particularly significant. The waterfall represents a kind of liquid humor or //rasa// (relationship). In the body there are different types of humor, //rasa// or mellow. The supreme mellow (relationship) is called the sexual mellow (//ādi-rasa//). When this //ādi-rasa,// or sex desire, comes in contact with the spring air moved by Cupid, it becomes agitated. In other words, all these are representations of //rūpa, rasa, gandha, śabda// and //sparśa.// The wind is //sparśa,// or touch. The waterfall is //rasa,// or taste. The spring air (//kusumākara//) is smell. All these varieties of enjoyment make life very pleasing, and thus we become captivated by material existence.
