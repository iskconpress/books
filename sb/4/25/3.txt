===== Purport =====

As pointed out by Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, //kaivalya,// or merging into the Brahman effulgence, is just like going to hell. He similarly states that elevation to the upper planetary systems for the enjoyment of heavenly life is just so much phantasmagoria. This means that a devotee does not give any importance to the ultimate goal of the //karmīs// and //jñānīs.// The ultimate goal of the //karmīs// is promotion to the heavenly kingdom, and the ultimate goal of the //jñānīs// is merging into the Brahman effulgence. Of course, the //jñānīs// are superior to the //karmīs,// as confirmed by Lord Caitanya. //Koṭi-karmaniṣṭha-madhye eka 'jñānī' śreṣṭha:// "one //jñānī,// or impersonalist, is better than many thousands of fruitive actors." [[books:cc:madhya:19:147|(Cc. Madhya 19.147)]] Therefore a devotee never enters upon the path of //karma,// or elevation by fruitive activities. Nārada Muni took compassion upon King Prācīnabarhiṣat when he saw the King engaged in fruitive activity. In comparison to mundane workers, those who are trying to be elevated to the higher planetary systems by performing //yajñas// are undoubtedly superior. In pure devotional service, however, both //karma// and //jñāna// are considered bewildering features of the illusory energy.
