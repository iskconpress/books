===== Purport =====

Such a speech is typical of a living entity attracted by the opposite sex. This is called bewilderment occasioned by becoming conditioned by material nature. When thus attracted by the beauty of the material energy, one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this instance of Purañjana's becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In conditional life the living entity is attracted by a face, eyebrows or eyes, a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man or a woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it does not matter whether the opposite sex is beautiful or not. The lover sees everything beautiful in the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction causes the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:27|(Bg. 7.27)]]:

> icchā-dveṣa-samutthena
> dvandva-mohena bhārata
> sarva-bhūtāni sammohaṁ
> sarge yānti parantapa

"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate."

This condition of life is called //avidyā.// Opposed to this //avidyā// is real knowledge. //Śrī Īśopaniṣad// distinguishes between //vidyā// and //avidyā,// knowledge and ignorance. By //avidyā// (ignorance) one becomes conditioned, and by //vidyā// (knowledge) one becomes liberated. Purañjana admits herein that he is attracted by //avidyā.// Now he wishes to see the complete feature of //avidyā// and so requests the girl to raise her head so that he can see her face to face. He thus wishes to see the various features that make //avidyā// attractive.
