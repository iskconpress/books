===== Translation =====

**The woman was protected on all sides by a five-hooded snake. She was very beautiful and young, and she appeared very anxious to find a suitable husband.**

===== Purport =====

The vital force of a living entity includes the five kinds of air working within the body, which are known as //prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna// and //udāna.// The vital force is compared to a serpent because a serpent can live by simply drinking air. The vital force carried by the air is described as the //pratīhāra,// or the bodyguard. Without the vital force one cannot live for a moment. Indeed, all the senses are working under the protection of the vital force.

The woman, who represents intelligence, was searching after a husband. This indicates that intelligence cannot act without consciousness. A beautiful woman is useless unless protected by the proper husband. Intelligence must always be very fresh; therefore the word //aprauḍhām// ("very young") is used here. Material enjoyment means utilizing the intelligence for the sake of //rūpa, rasa, gandha, śabda// and //sparśa,// or form, taste, smell, sound and touch.
