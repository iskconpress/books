===== Translation =====

**In this way, the fully Kṛṣṇa conscious Dhruva Mahārāja, the exalted son of Mahārāja Uttānapāda, attained the summit of the three statuses of planetary systems.**

===== Purport =====

The exact Sanskrit terminology for Kṛṣṇa consciousness is here mentioned: //kṛṣṇa-parāyaṇaḥ. parāyaṇa// means "going forward." Anyone who is going forward to the goal of Kṛṣṇa is called //kṛṣṇa-parāyaṇa,// or fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. The example of Dhruva Mahārāja indicates that every Kṛṣṇa conscious person can expect to reach the topmost summit of all three planetary systems within the universe. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person can occupy an exalted position beyond the imagination of any ambitious materialist.
