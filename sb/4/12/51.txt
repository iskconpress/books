**The narration of Dhruva Mahārāja is sublime knowledge for the attainment of immortality. Persons unaware of the Absolute Truth can be led to the path of truth. Those who out of transcendental kindness take on the responsibility of becoming master-protectors of the poor living entities automatically gain the interest and blessings of the demigods.**

===== Purport =====

//Jñānam ajñāta// means knowledge which is unknown almost throughout the entire world. No one knows actually what is the Absolute Truth. Materialists are very proud of their advancement in education, in philosophical speculation and in scientific knowledge, but no one actually knows what the Absolute Truth is. The great sage Maitreya, therefore, recommends that to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth (//tattva//), devotees should preach the teachings of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// throughout the entire world. Śrīla Vyāsadeva especially compiled this great literature of scientific knowledge because people are completely unaware of the Absolute Truth. In the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// First Canto, it is said that Vyāsadeva, the learned sage, compiled this great //Bhāgavata Purāṇa// just to stop the ignorance of the mass of people. Because people do not know the Absolute Truth, this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was specifically compiled by Vyāsadeva under the instruction of Nārada. Generally, even though people are interested in understanding the truth, they take to speculation and reach at most the conception of impersonal Brahman. But very few men actually know the Personality of Godhead.

Recitation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is specifically meant to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although there is no fundamental difference between impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and the Supreme Person, factual immortality cannot be obtained unless and until one attains the stage of associating with the Supreme Person. Devotional service, which leads to the association of the Supreme Lord, is actual immortality. Pure devotees, out of compassion for the fallen souls, are //kṛpālu,// very kind to people in general; they distribute this //Bhāgavata// knowledge all over the world. A kindhearted devotee is called //dīna-nātha,// protector of the poor, ignorant mass of people. Lord Kṛṣṇa is also known as //dīna-nātha// or //dīna-bandhu,// the master or actual friend of the poor living entities, and His pure devotee also takes the same position of //dīna-nātha.// The //dīna-nāthas,// or devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who preach the path of devotional service, become the favorites of the demigods. Generally people are interested in worshiping the demigods, especially Lord Śiva, in order to obtain material benefits, but a pure devotee, who engages in preaching the principles of devotional service, as prescribed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// does not need to separately worship the demigods; the demigods are automatically pleased with him and offer all the blessings within their capacity. As by watering the root of a tree the leaves and branches are automatically watered, so, by executing pure devotional service to the Lord, the branches, twigs and leaves of the Lord, known as demigods, are automatically pleased with the devotee, and they offer all benedictions.
