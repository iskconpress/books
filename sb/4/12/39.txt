===== Purport =====

Each and every planet within the universe travels at a very high speed. From a statement in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is understood that even the sun travels sixteen thousand miles in a second, and from //Brahma-saṁhitā// we understand from the //śloka, yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām// that the sun is considered to be the eye of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, and it also has a specific orbit within which it circles. Similarly, all other planets have their specific orbits. But together all of them encircle the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mahārāja is situated at the summit of the three worlds. We can only imagine how highly exalted the actual position of a devotee is, and certainly we cannot even conceive how exalted is the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
