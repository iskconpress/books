===== Purport =====

According to astronomical calculation, along with the polestar there is another star, which is called Śiśumāra, where Lord Viṣṇu, who is in charge of the maintenance of this material world, resides. Śiśumāra or Dhruvaloka can never be reached by anyone but the Vaiṣṇavas, as will be described by the following //ślokas.// The associates of Lord Viṣṇu brought the special airplane for Dhruva Mahārāja and then informed him that Lord Viṣṇu had especially sent this airplane.

The Vaikuṇṭha airplane does not move by mechanical arrangement. There are three processes for moving in outer space. One of the processes is known to the modern scientist. It is called //ka-pota-vāyu. Ka// means "outer space," and //pota// means "ship." There is a second process also called //kapota-vāyu. Kapota// means "pigeon." One can train pigeons to carry one into outer space. The third process is very subtle. It is called //ākāśa-patana.// This //ākāśa-patana// system is also material. Just as the mind can fly anywhere one likes without mechanical arrangement, so the //ākāśa-patana// airplane can fly at the speed of mind. Beyond this //ākāśa-patana// system is the Vaikuṇṭha process, which is completely spiritual. The airplane sent by Lord Viṣṇu to carry Dhruva Mahārāja to Śiśumāra was a completely spiritual, transcendental airplane. Material scientists can neither see such vehicles nor imagine how they fly in the air. The material scientist has no information about the spiritual sky, although it is mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā// (//paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyaḥ [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]//).
