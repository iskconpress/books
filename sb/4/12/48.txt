===== Purport =====

It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. In this verse it is especially recommended that Dhruva Mahārāja's character be discussed in a society of the twice-born, which refers to the qualified //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas.// One should especially seek the society of //brāhmaṇas// who are elevated to the position of Vaiṣṇavas. Thus discussion of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which describes the character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord, is very quickly effective. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has been organized for this purpose. In every center of this Society---not only in the morning, evening or noon, but practically twenty-four hours a day---there is continuous devotional service going on. Anyone who comes in contact with the Society automatically becomes a devotee. We have actual experience that many //karmīs// and others come to the Society and find a very pleasing and peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse the word //dvi janmanām// means "of the twice-born." Anyone can join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and be initiated to become twice-born. As recommended by Sanātana Gosvāmī, by the process of initiation and authorized training, any man can become twice-born. The first birth is made possible by the parents, and the second birth is made possible by the spiritual father and Vedic knowledge. Unless one is twice-born one cannot understand the transcendental characteristics of the Lord and His devotees. Study of the //Vedas// is therefore forbidden for //śūdras.// Simply by academic qualifications a //śūdra// cannot understand the transcendental science. At the present moment, throughout the entire world the educational system is geared to produce //śūdras.// A big technologist is no more than a big //śūdra. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:// in the age of Kali, everyone is a //śūdra.// Because the whole population of the world consists only of //śūdras,// there is a decline of spiritual knowledge, and people are unhappy. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started especially to create qualified //brāhmaṇas// to broadcast spiritual knowledge all over the world, for thus people may become very happy.
