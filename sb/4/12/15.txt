**Śrīla Dhruva Mahārāja realized that this cosmic manifestation bewilders living entities like a dream or phantasmagoria because it is a creation of the illusory, external energy of the Supreme Lord.**

===== Purport =====

In the deep forest it sometimes appears that there are big palaces and nice cities. That is technically called //gandharva-nagara.// Similarly, in dreams also we create many false things out of imagination. A self-realized person, or a devotee, knows well that this material cosmic manifestation is a temporary, illusory representation appearing to be truth. It is like a phantasmagoria. But behind this shadow creation there is reality---the spiritual world. A devotee is interested in the spiritual world, not its shadow. Since he has realization of the supreme truth, a devotee is not interested in this temporary shadow of truth. This is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// (//paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 9.59]]]).
