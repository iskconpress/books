When Dhruva Mahārāja went to perform austerities, he was very determined to achieve a post never dreamed of by his forefathers. His father was Uttānapāda, his grandfather was Manu, and his great-grandfather was Lord Brahmā. So Dhruva wanted a kingdom even greater than Lord Brahmā could achieve, and he requested Nārada Muni to give him facility for achieving it. The associates of Lord Viṣṇu reminded him that not only his forefathers but everyone else before him was unable to attain Viṣṇuloka, the planet where Lord Viṣṇu resides. This is because everyone within this material world is either a //karmī,// a //jñānī// or a //yogī,// but there are hardly any pure devotees. The transcendental planet known as Viṣṇuloka is especially meant for devotees, not for //karmīs, jñānīs// or //yogīs.// Great //ṛṣis// or demigods can hardly approach Brahmaloka, and as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// Brahmaloka is not a permanent residence. Lord Brahmā's duration of life is so long that it is difficult to estimate even the duration of one day in his life, and yet Lord Brahmā also dies, as do the residents of his planet. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:16|(Bg. 8.16)]] says, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna:// except for those who go to Viṣṇuloka, everyone is subjected to the four principles of material life, namely birth, death, old age and disease. The Lord says, //yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama:// "The planet from which, once going, no one returns, is My supreme abode." [[books:bg:15:6|(Bg. 15.6)]] Dhruva Mahārāja was reminded, "You are going in our company to that planet from which no one returns to this material world." Material scientists are attempting to go to the moon and other planets, but they cannot imagine going to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, for it is beyond their imagination. By material calculation, traveling at the speed of light it would take forty thousand light-years to reach the topmost planet. By mechanical processes we are unable to reach the topmost planet of this universe, but the process called //bhakti-yoga,// as executed by Mahārāja Dhruva, can give one the facility not only to reach other planets within this universe, but also to reach beyond this universe to the Viṣṇuloka planets. We have outlined this in our small booklet //Easy Journey to Other Planets.//
