Yogīśvara// indicates that no one can surpass the //yoga// practice of Lord Śiva, and //yogeśvara// indicates that no one can surpass the yogic perfection of Kṛṣṇa. Another significant word is //tarka-mudrā.// This indicates that the fingers are opened and the second finger is raised, along with the arm, to impress the audience with some subject matter. This is actually a symbolic representation.
