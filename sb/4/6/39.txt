===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //brahmānanda// is significant. This //brahmānanda,// or //brahma-nirvāṇa,// is explained by Prahlāda Mahārāja. When one is completely absorbed in the //adhokṣaja,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the sense perception of materialistic persons, one is situated in //brahmānanda.//

It is impossible to conceive of the existence, name, form, quality and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is transcendentally situated beyond the conception of materialistic persons. Because materialists cannot imagine or conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they may think that God is dead, but factually He is always existing in His //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], His eternal form. Constant meditation concentrated on the form of the Lord is called //samādhi,// ecstasy or trance. //Samādhi// means particularly concentrated attention, so one who has achieved the qualification of always meditating on the Personality of Godhead is to be understood to be always in trance and enjoying //brahma-nirvāṇa,// or //brahmānanda.// Lord Śiva exhibited those symptoms, and therefore it is stated that he was absorbed in //brahmānanda.//

Another significant word is //yoga-kakṣām. Yoga-kakṣā// is the sitting posture in which the left thigh is fixed under one's tightly knotted saffron-colored garment. Also the words //manūnām ādyam// are significant here because they mean a philosopher, or one who is thoughtful and can think very nicely. Such a man is called //manu.// Lord Śiva is described in this verse as the chief of all thinkers. Lord Śiva, of course, does not engage in useless mental speculation, but as stated in the previous verse, he is always thoughtful regarding how to deliver the demons from their fallen condition of life. It is said that during the advent of Lord Caitanya, Sadāśiva appeared as Advaita Prabhu, and Advaita Prabhu's chief concern was to elevate the fallen conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Since people were engaged in useless occupations which would continue their material existence, Lord Śiva, in the form of Lord Advaita, appealed to the Supreme Lord to appear as Lord Caitanya to deliver these illusioned souls. Actually Lord Caitanya appeared on the request of Lord Advaita. Similarly, Lord Śiva has a //sampradāya,// the Rudra-sampradāya. He is always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls, as exhibited by Lord Advaita Prabhu.
