===== Translation =====

**When Bhṛgu Muni offered oblations in the fire, immediately many thousands of demigods named Ṛbhus became manifested. All of them were powerful, having achieved strength from Soma, the moon.**

===== Purport =====

It is stated here that many thousands of demigods named Ṛbhus became manifested because of the oblations offered in the fire and the chanting of the hymns from the //Yajur Veda. Brāhmaṇas// like Bhṛgu Muni were so powerful that they could create such powerful demigods simply by chanting the Vedic //mantras.// Vedic //mantras// are still available, but the chanters are not. By chanting Vedic //mantras// or chanting the Gāyatrī or //ṛg-mantra// one can attain the results one desires. In the present age of Kali it is recommended by Lord Caitanya that simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa one can attain all perfection.
