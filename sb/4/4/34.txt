===== Translation =====

**When the Ṛbhu demigods attacked the ghosts and Guhyakas with half-burned fuel from the yajña fire, all these attendants of Satī fled in different directions and disappeared. This was possible simply because of brahma-tejas, brahminical power.**

===== Purport =====

The word //brahma-tejasā,// used in this verse, is significant. In those days, //brāhmaṇas// were so powerful that simply by desiring and by chanting a Vedic //mantra,// they could accomplish very wonderful effects. But in the present age of degradation there are no such //brāhmaṇas.// According to the //pāñcarātrika// system, in this age the entire population is supposed to consist of //śūdras// because the brahminical culture has been lost. But if anyone displays the signs of understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he should be accepted, according to Vaiṣṇava //smṛti// regulations, as a prospective //brāhmaṇa// and should be given all facilities to achieve the highest perfection. The most magnanimous gift of Lord Caitanya's is that the highest perfection of life is available in this fallen age if one simply adopts the process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, which is able to bring about the fulfillment of all activities in self-realization.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Satī Quits Her Body."
