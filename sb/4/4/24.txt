===== Purport =====

It is said that when a man desires to quit his body he dresses in saffron garments. Therefore it appears that Satī changed her dress, indicating that she was going to quit the body given her by Dakṣa. Dakṣa was Satī's father, so instead of killing Dakṣa she decided that it would be better to destroy the part of his body which was hers. Thus she decided to give up the body of Dakṣa by the yogic process. Satī was the wife of Lord Śiva, who is known as Yogeśvara, the best among all //yogīs,// because he knows all the mystic processes of //yoga,// so it appeared that Satī also knew them. Either she learned //yoga// from her husband or she was enlightened because she was the daughter of such a great king as Dakṣa. The perfection of //yoga// is that one can give up one's body or release oneself from the embodiment of material elements according to one's desire. //Yogīs// who have attained perfection are not subject to death by natural laws; such perfect //yogīs// can leave the body whenever they desire. Generally the //yogī// first of all becomes mature in controlling the air passing within the body, thus bringing the soul to the top of the brain. Then when the body bursts into flames, the //yogī// can go anywhere he likes. This //yoga// system recognizes the soul, and thus it is distinct from the so-called //yoga// process for controlling the cells of the body, which has been discovered in the modern age. The real //yoga// process accepts the transmigration of the soul from one planet to another or one body to another; and it appears from this incident that Satī wanted to transfer her soul to another body or sphere.
