===== Translation =====

Then she raised her life air, mixed with intelligence, to the heart and then gradually towards the pulmonary passage and from there to between her eyebrows.**

===== Purport =====

The yogic process is to control the air passing within the body in different places called //ṣaṭ-cakra,// the six circles of air circulation. The air is raised from the abdomen to the navel, from the navel to the heart, from the heart to the throat, from the throat to between the eyebrows and from between the eyebrows to the top of the cerebrum. That is the sum and substance of practicing //yoga.// Before practicing the real //yoga// system, one has to practice the sitting postures because this helps in the breathing exercises which control the airs going upwards and downwards. This is a great technique which one has to practice to attain the highest perfectional stage of //yoga,// but such practice is not meant for this age. No one in this age can attain the perfectional stage of such //yoga,// but people indulge in practicing sitting postures, which is more or less a gymnastic process. By such bodily gymnastics one may develop good circulation and may therefore keep one's body fit, but if one simply restricts oneself to that gymnastic process one cannot attain the highest perfectional stage. The //yoga// process, as described in the //Keśava-śruti,// prescribes how one can control his living force according to his desire and transmigrate from one body to another or from one place to another. In other words, //yoga// practice is not meant to keep the body fit. Any transcendental process of spiritual realization automatically helps one to keep the body fit, for it is the spirit soul that keeps the body always fresh. As soon as the spirit soul is out of the body, the material body immediately begins to decompose. Any spiritual process keeps the body fit without separate endeavor, but if one takes it that the ultimate aim of //yoga// is to maintain the body, then he is mistaken. The real perfection of //yoga// is elevation of the soul to a higher position or the liberation of the soul from material entanglement. Some //yogīs// try to elevate the soul to higher planetary systems, where the standard of life is different from that of this planet and where the material comforts, life-span and other facilities for self-realization are greater, and some //yogīs// endeavor to elevate the soul to the spiritual world, the spiritual Vaikuṇṭha planets. The //bhakti-yoga// process directly elevates the soul to the spiritual planets, where life is eternally blissful and full of knowledge; therefore //bhakti-yoga// is considered to be the greatest of all //yoga// systems.
