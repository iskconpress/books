===== Translation =====

**Dakṣa, who is so hardhearted that he is unworthy to be a brāhmaṇa, will gain extensive ill fame because of his offenses to his daughter, because of not having prevented her death, and because of his great envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

Dakṣa is described here as most hardhearted and therefore unqualified to be a //brāhmaṇa. Brahma-dhruk// is described by some commentators to mean //brahma-bandhu,// or friend of the //brāhmaṇas.// A person who is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family but has no brahminical qualifications is called a //brahma-bandhu. Brāhmaṇas// are generally very softhearted and forbearing because they have the power to control the senses and the mind. Dakṣa, however, was not forbearing. For the simple reason that his son-in-law, Lord Śiva, did not stand up to show him the formality of respect, he became so angry and hardhearted that he tolerated even the death of his dearest daughter. Satī tried her best to mitigate the misunderstanding between the son-in-law and the father-in-law by coming to her father's house, even without an invitation, and at that time Dakṣa should have received her, forgetting all past misunderstandings. But he was so hardhearted that he was unworthy to be called an Āryan or //brāhmaṇa.// Thus his ill fame still continues. //Dakṣa// means "expert," and he was given this name because of his ability to beget many hundreds and thousands of children. Persons who are too sexually inclined and materialistic become so hardhearted because of a slight loss of prestige that they can tolerate even the death of their children.
