===== Translation =====

**When they saw Satī leaving alone very rapidly, thousands of Lord Śiva's disciples, headed by Maṇimān and Mada, quickly followed her with his bull Nandī in front and accompanied by the Yakṣas.**

===== Purport =====

Satī was going very fast so that she might not be checked by her husband, but she was immediately followed by the many thousands of disciples of Lord Śiva, headed by the Yakṣas, Maṇimān and Mada. The word //gata-vyathāḥ,// used in this connection, means "without fear." Satī did not care that she was going alone; therefore she was almost fearless. The word //anucarāḥ// is also significant, for it indicates that Lord Śiva's disciples were always ready to sacrifice anything for Lord Śiva. All of them could understand the desire of Śiva, who did not want Satī to go alone. //Anucarāḥ// means "those who can immediately understand the purpose of their master."
