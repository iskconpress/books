===== Translation =====

**Śrī Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, when Dhruva Mahārāja heard the encouraging words of the great sages, he performed the ācamana by touching water and then took up his arrow made by Lord Nārāyaṇa and fixed it upon his bow.**

===== Purport =====

Dhruva Mahārāja was given a specific arrow made by Lord Nārāyaṇa Himself, and he now fixed it upon his bow to finish the illusory atmosphere created by the Yakṣas. As it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]], //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.// Without Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one is able to overcome the action of the illusory energy. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also given us a nice weapon for this age, as stated in the //Bhāgavatam: sāṅgopāṅgāstra//---in this age, the //nārāyaṇāstra,// or weapon to drive away //māyā,// is the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// in pursuance of the associates of Lord Caitanya, such as Advaita Prabhu, Nityānanda, Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa.
