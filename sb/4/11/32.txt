===== Translation =====

**A person who desires liberation from this material world should not fall under the control of anger because when bewildered by anger one becomes a source of dread for all others.**

===== Purport =====

A devotee or saintly person should not be dreadful to others, nor should anyone be a source of dread to him. If one treats others with nonenmity, then no one will become his enemy. There is the example, however, of Jesus Christ, who had enemies, and they crucified him. The demonic are always present, and they find fault even in saintly persons. But a saintly person never becomes angry, even if there is very great provocation.
