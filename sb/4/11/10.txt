===== Purport =====

The words //sādhūnāṁ hṛṣīkeśānuvartinām// are very significant. //Sādhu// means "a saintly person." But who is a saintly person? A saintly person is he who follows the path of rendering service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hṛṣīkeśa. In the //Nārada-pañcarātra// it is said, //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate:// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]] the process of rendering favorable service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead with one's senses is called //bhakti,// or devotional service. Therefore, why should a person who is already engaged in the service of the Lord engage himself in personal sense gratification? Dhruva Mahārāja is advised here by Lord Manu that he is a pure servitor of the Lord. Why should he unnecessarily engage, like the animals, in the bodily concept of life? An animal thinks that the body of another animal is his food; therefore, in the bodily concept of life, one animal attacks another. A human being, especially one who is a devotee of the Lord, should not act like this. A //sādhu,// a saintly devotee, is not supposed to kill animals unnecessarily.
