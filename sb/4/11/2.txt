===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, and //māyā,// or the illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa, is like darkness. Darkness means absence of light; similarly, //māyā// means absence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness and //māyā// are always there, side by side. As soon as there is awakening of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all the illusory pains and pleasures of material existence are vanquished. //Māyām etāṁ taranti te:// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]] constant chanting of the //mahā-mantra// will keep us always aloof from the illusory energy of //māyā.//
