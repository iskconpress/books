Vedic evidence is called //śabda-brahma.// There are many things which are beyond the perception of our imperfect senses, yet the authoritative evidence of sound vibration is perfect. The //Vedas// are known as //śabda-brahma// because evidence taken from the //Vedas// constitutes the ultimate understanding. This is because //śabda-brahma,// or the //Vedas,// represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, the real essence of //śabda-brahma// is the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// By vibrating this transcendental sound, the meaning of everything, both material and spiritual, is revealed. This Hare Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. The meaning of everything is received through the air through sound vibration. The vibration may be material or spiritual, but without sound vibration no one can understand the meaning of anything. In the //Vedas// it is said, //antar bahiś ca tat sarvaṁ vyāya nārāyaṇaḥ sthitaḥ:// "Nārāyaṇa is all-pervading, and He exists both within and without." This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:13:34|(Bg. 13.34)]]:

> yathā prakāśayaty ekaḥ
> kṛtsnaṁ lokam imaṁ raviḥ
> kṣetraṁ kṣetrī tathā kṛtsnaṁ
> prakāśayati bhārata

"O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so do the living entity and the Supersoul illuminate the entire body by consciousness."

In other words, the consciousness of both the soul and Supersoul is all-pervading; the limited consciousness of the living entity is pervading the entire material body, and the supreme consciousness of the Lord is pervading the entire universe. Because the soul is present within the body, consciousness pervades the entire body; similarly, because the supreme soul, or Kṛṣṇa, is present within this universe, everything is working in order. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:// "This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings." [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]]

Lord Śiva is therefore praying to the Personality of Godhead to be kind to us so that simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// we can understand everything in both the material and spiritual worlds. The word //amuṣmai// is significant in this regard because it indicates the best target one can aim for after attaining the higher planetary systems. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities (//karmīs//) attain the higher planetary systems as a result of their past activities, and the //jñānīs,// who seek unification or a monistic merging with the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, also attain their desired end, but in the ultimate issue, the devotees, who desire to personally associate with the Lord, are promoted to the Vaikuṇṭhalokas or Goloka Vṛndāvana. The Lord is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:12-13|(Bg. 10.12)]] as //pavitraṁ paramam,// the supreme pure. This is also confirmed in this verse. Śukadeva Gosvāmī has stated that the cowherd boys who played with Lord Kṛṣṇa were not ordinary living entities. Only after accumulating many pious activities in various births does one get the opportunity to personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since only the pure can reach Him, He is the supreme pure.
