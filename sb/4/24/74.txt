===== Purport =====

Perfection means becoming a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. As stated in the First Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:28|(1.2.28)]]: //vāsudeva-parā vedā vāsudeva-parā makhāḥ.// The ultimate goal of life is Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa. Any devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa can attain all perfection, material gains and liberation simply by offering prayers to Him. There are many varieties of prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa chanted by great sages and great personalities such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Lord Kṛṣṇa is known as //śiva-viriñcinutam// (SB 11.5.33). //Śiva// means Lord Śiva, and //viriñci// means Lord Brahmā. Both of these demigods are engaged in offering prayers to Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. If we follow in the footsteps of such great personalities and become devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, our lives will become successful. Unfortunately people do not know this secret. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:// "They do not know that the real interest and the highest perfection of life is to worship Lord Viṣṇu [Kṛṣṇa]." [[books:sb:7:5:31|(SB 7.5.31)]] It is impossible to become satisfied by trying to adjust the external energy. Without being a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one can only be baffled and confused. To save living entities from such a calamity, Lord Kṛṣṇa points out in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:19|(Bg. 7.19)]]:

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ

"After many, many births and deaths, a wise man surrenders unto Me, knowing very well that I, Vāsudeva, am everything. Such a great soul is very rare."

We can achieve whatever benediction we want simply by becoming devotees of Vāsudeva.
