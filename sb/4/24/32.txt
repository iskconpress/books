===== Translation =====

**The great sage Maitreya continued: Out of his causeless mercy, the exalted personality Lord Śiva, a great devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, continued to speak to the King's sons, who were standing with folded hands.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Śiva voluntarily came to bless the sons of the King as well as do something beneficial for them. He personally chanted the //mantra// so that the //mantra// would be more powerful, and he advised that the //mantra// be chanted by the King's sons (//rāja-putras//). When a //mantra// is chanted by a great devotee, the //mantra// becomes more powerful. Although the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is powerful in itself, a disciple upon initiation receives the //mantra// from his spiritual master, for when the //mantra// is chanted by the spiritual master, it becomes more powerful. Lord Śiva advised the sons of the King to hear him attentively, for inattentive hearing is offensive.
