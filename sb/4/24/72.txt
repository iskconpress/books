===== Translation =====

**This prayer was first spoken to us by Lord Brahmā, the master of all creators. The creators, headed by Bhṛgu, were instructed in these prayers because they wanted to create.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Brahmā was created by Lord Viṣṇu; then Lord Brahmā created Lord Śiva and other great sages, headed by Bhṛgu Muni. These great sages included Bhṛgu, Marīci, Ātreya, Vasiṣṭha and others. All these great sages were in charge of creating population. Since there were not very many living entities in the beginning, Viṣṇu entrusted Brahmā with the business of creation, and Brahmā in his turn created many hundreds and thousands of demigods and great sages to continue with the creation. At the same time, Lord Brahmā cautioned all his sons and disciples by reciting the prayers now recited by Lord Śiva. The material creation means material engagement, but material engagements can be counteracted if we always remember our relationship with the Lord as that relationship is described in these prayers recited by Lord Śiva. In this way we can remain constantly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus despite our engagement in the creation, we cannot be deviated from the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. In this material world everyone is engaged in some particular occupational duty which is prescribed in the //varṇāśrama-dharma. Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras// and everyone are engaged in their occupational duty, but if one remembers his first duty---keeping in constant contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead---everything will be successful. If one simply executes the rules and regulations of the //varṇāśrama-dharma// in the role of a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra// and keeps busy and does not remember one's eternal relationship with the Lord, one's business and activities as well as occupational duties will simply be a waste of time. This is confirmed in the First Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|(1.2.8)]]:

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed yadi ratiṁ
> śrama eva hi kevalam

The conclusion is that even if one is busy executing his occupational duty, his business in Kṛṣṇa consciousness need not be hampered. He has simply to execute the devotional service of //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]---hearing, chanting and remembering. One need not abandon his occupational duty. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:46|(Bg. 18.46)]]:

> yataḥ pravṛttir bhūtānāṁ
> yena sarvam idaṁ tatam
> sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya
> siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ

"By worship of the Lord---who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading-man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection."

Thus one can continue with his occupational duty, but if he worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord Śiva herein prescribes, he attains his perfection of life. //Svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|(SB 1.2.13)]]. We should continue executing our occupational duties, but if we try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by our duties, then our lives will be perfected.
