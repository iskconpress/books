===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart, and from Him issue a living entity's inclinations and disinclinations. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]]:

> sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo
> mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca

"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead causes the //asuras// to forget Him and the devotees to remember Him. One's disinclinations are due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:16:7|(Bg. 16.7)]], //pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ:// the //asuras// do not know which way one should be inclined to act and which way one should not be inclined to act. Although the //asuras// oppose devotional service, it is to be understood that they are inclined that way due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the //asuras// do not like to engage in the Lord's devotional service, the Lord within gives them the intelligence to forget. Ordinary //karmīs// desire promotion to Pitṛloka, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:25|(Bg. 9.25)]]. //Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ:// "Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, and those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors."

In this verse the word //duḥkha-dāya// is also very significant, for those who are nondevotees are perpetually put into the cycle of birth and death. This is a very miserable condition. Because one's position in life is attained according to one's activities, the //asuras,// or nondevotees, are put into such miserable conditions.
