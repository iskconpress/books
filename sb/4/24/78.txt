===== Purport =====

//Mukti,// or liberation, means becoming free from the results of fruitive activities. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:10:6|(2.10.6)]]: //muktir hitvānyathā-rūpam. Mukti// means giving up all other activities and being situated in one's constitutional position (//svarupeṇa vyavasthitiḥ//). In this conditional state, we are entangled by one fruitive activity after another. //Karma-bandhana// means "the bonds of fruitive activity." As long as one's mind is absorbed in fruitive activities, he has to manufacture plans for happiness. The //bhakti-yoga// process is different, for //bhakti-yoga// means acting according to the order of the supreme authority. When we act under the direction of supreme authority, we do not become entangled by fruitive results. For instance, Arjuna fought because the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted him to; therefore he was not responsible for the outcome of the fighting. As far as devotional service is concerned, even hearing and chanting is as good as acting with our body, mind and senses. Actually, hearing and chanting are also activities of the senses. When the senses are utilized for one's own sense gratification, they entangle one in //karma,// but when they are used for the satisfaction of the Lord, they establish one in //bhakti.//
