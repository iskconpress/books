**My dear Lord, You are the topmost of all bestowers of all benediction, the oldest and supreme enjoyer amongst all enjoyers. You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the supreme cause of all causes, Lord Kṛṣṇa.

===== Purport =====

The words //kṛṣṇāya akuṇṭha-medhase// are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called //aṇu,// an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has a limited brain. What Kṛṣṇa says and does is not limited by time and space. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:26|(Bg. 7.26)]] the Lord says:

> vedāhaṁ samatītāni
> vartamānāni cārjuna
> bhaviṣyāṇi ca bhūtāni
> māṁ tu veda na kaścana

"O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows."

Kṛṣṇa knows everything, but one cannot know Kṛṣṇa without being favored by Him. Thus for Kṛṣṇa and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What Kṛṣṇa says is all perfect and certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows exactly what Kṛṣṇa says. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, as spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty.

Lord Kṛṣṇa is also addressed herein as //āśiṣām īśa.// The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Kṛṣṇa, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word //manave,// meaning "unto the supreme Manu," is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Svāyambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of Kṛṣṇa (//manvantara-avatāra//). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmā, 420 in one month, all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Kṛṣṇa is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word //manave// indicates the perfection of all kinds of //mantras.// The //mantra// delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the //mantra// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition.

//Kāraṇātmane:// everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In //Brahma-saṁhitā// Kṛṣṇa is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as //kāraṇātmane.// His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As described in the //Vedānta-sūtra// (1.1.2), //janmādy asya yataḥ:// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]] the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations.

The word //sāṅkhya-yogeśvarāya// is also significant herein, for Kṛṣṇa is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as Yogeśvara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The //sāṅkhya-yoga// system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original //sāṅkhya-yoga// system was propounded by an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa also named Kapila, the son of Devahūti. Similarly, Dattātreya, another incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, also explained the //sāṅkhya-yoga// system. Thus Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all //sāṅkhya-yoga// systems and mystic //yoga// powers.

The words //puruṣāya purāṇāya// are also worthy of special attention. In //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the //ādi-puruṣa,// the original person, or the original enjoyer. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// Lord Kṛṣṇa is also accepted as //purāṇa-puruṣa,// the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also the youngest of all, or //nava-yauvana.// Another significant word is //dharmāya.// Since Kṛṣṇa is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|(SB 6.3.19)]]. No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord Kṛṣṇa. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa informs us of the original //dharma// and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real //dharma// is surrender unto Him. In the //Mahābhārata,// it is also said:

> ye ca veda-vido viprā
> ye cādhyātma-vido janāḥ
> te vadanti mahātmānaṁ
> kṛṣṇaṁ dharmaṁ sanātanam

The purport is that one who has studied the //Vedas// perfectly, who is a perfect //vipra,// or knower of the //Vedas,// who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, as one's //sanātana-dharma.// Lord Śiva therefore teaches us the principles of //sanātana-dharma.//
