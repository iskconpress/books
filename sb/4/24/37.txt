===== Purport =====

The word //svarga// indicates a position in the higher or heavenly planetary systems, and the word //apavarga// means "liberation." Those who are attached to the //karma-kāṇḍīya// activities described in the //Vedas// are actually entangled in the three modes of material nature. The //Bhagavad-gītā// therefore says that one should be above the dominion of fruitive activities. There are different kinds of liberation, or //mukti.// The best //mukti// is engagement in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Not only does Lord Aniruddha help fruitive actors by elevating them to the higher planetary systems, but He also helps the devotee engage in devotional service by dint of His inexhaustible energy. Just as heat is the source of material energy, the inspiration of Lord Aniruddha is the energy by which one can engage in executing devotional service.
