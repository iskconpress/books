===== Purport =====

In the //haṭha-yoga// system one has to practice bodily exercises, //dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana,// meditation, etc. One also has to sit in one place in a particular posture and concentrate his gaze on the tip of the nose. There are so many rules and regulations for the //haṭha-yoga// system that it is practically impossible to perform it in this age. The alternative system of //bhakti-yoga// is very easy not only in this age but in others as well, for this //yoga// system was advocated long ago by Lord Śiva when he advised the princes, the sons of Mahārāja Prācīnabarhiṣat. The //bhakti-yoga// system is not newly introduced, for even five thousand years ago Lord Kṛṣṇa recommended this //bhakti-yoga// as the topmost //yoga.// As Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]:

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all."

The topmost //yogī// is he who constantly thinks of Kṛṣṇa within himself and chants the glories of the Lord. In other words, this system of //bhakti-yoga// has been existing from time immemorial and is now continuing in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

The word //muni-vratāḥ// is significant in this regard because those who are interested in advancing in spiritual life must be silent. Silence means talking only of //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// This is the silence of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa:

> sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane

"King Ambarīṣa always fixed his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord and talked of Him only." [[books:sb:9:4:19|(SB 9.4.19)]] We should also take this opportunity in life to become as good as a great saint simply by not talking unnecessarily with unwanted persons. We should either talk of Kṛṣṇa or chant Hare Kṛṣṇa undeviatingly. This is called //muni-vrata.// The intelligence must be very sharp (//samāhita-dhiyaḥ//) and should always be acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The words //etad abhyasatādṛtāḥ// indicate that if one takes these instructions from a spiritual master with great reverence (//ādṛta//) and practices them accordingly, he will find this //bhakti-yoga// process to be very, very easy.
