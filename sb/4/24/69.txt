===== Purport =====

The prayers offered by Lord Śiva are very authoritative and significant. Simply by offering prayers to the Supreme Lord one can become perfect, even though engaged in his occupational duty. The real purpose of life is to become a devotee of the Lord. It does not matter where one is situated. Whether one is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// American, Englishman, Indian, etc., one can execute devotional service anywhere and everywhere in the material existence simply by offering prayers unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is also a prayer, for a prayer addresses the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His name and invokes good fortune by petitioning the Lord to allow one to engage in His devotional service. The Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// also says, "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, my dear Lord Rāma, O energy of the Lord, Hare, kindly engage me in Your service." Although one may be situated in a lowly position, he can execute devotional service under any circumstance, as stated, //ahaituky apratihatā:// "Devotional service cannot be checked by any material condition." [[books:sb:1:2:6|(SB 1.2.6)]] Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu also recommended this process:

> jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva
> jīvanti san-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām
> sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir
> ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām
> (SB 10.14.3)

One may remain situated in his own place or his own occupational duty and still lend his ear to receive the message of the Lord from realized souls. The Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is based on this principle, and we are opening centers all over the world to give everyone a chance to hear the message of Lord Kṛṣṇa in order to go back home, back to Godhead.
