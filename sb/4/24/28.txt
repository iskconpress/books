===== Purport =====

Now Lord Śiva explains the reason he has personally come before the princes. It is because all the princes are devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:19|(Bg. 7.19)]]:

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ

"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."

Lord Śiva is rarely seen by common men, and similarly a person who is fully surrendered unto Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is also very rarely seen because a person who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord is very rare (//sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ//). Consequently Lord Śiva came especially to see the Pracetās because they were fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva is also mentioned in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the //mantra, oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Since Vāsudeva is the ultimate truth, Lord Śiva openly proclaims that one who is a devotee of Lord Vāsudeva, who is surrendered to Lord Kṛṣṇa, is actually very dear to him. Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is worshipable not only by ordinary living entities but by demigods like Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and others. //Yaṁ brahmā-varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stuvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ// (SB 12.13.1). Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Varuṇa, Indra, Candra and all other demigods. That is also the situation with a devotee. Indeed, one who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately becomes very dear to anyone who is simply finding out and beginning to understand what Kṛṣṇa consciousness actually is. Similarly, all the demigods are also trying to find out who is actually surrendered to Lord Vāsudeva. Because the Pracetā princes were surrendered to Vāsudeva, Lord Śiva willingly came forth to see them.

Lord Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as Puruṣottama. Actually He is the enjoyer (//puruṣa//) and the Supreme (//uttama//) as well. He is the enjoyer of everything---the //prakṛti// and the //puruṣa.// Being influenced by the three modes of material nature, the living entity tries to dominate material nature, but actually he is not the //puruṣa// (enjoyer) but //prakṛti,// as described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:5|(Bg. 7.5)]]: //apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām.// Thus the //jīva,// or living entity, is actually //prakṛti,// or the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. Being associated with material energy, he tries to lord it over the material nature. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:7|(Bg. 15.7)]]:

> mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke
> jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ
> manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi
> prakṛti-sthāni karṣati

"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind."

By endeavoring to dominate material nature, the living entity simply struggles hard for existence. Indeed, he struggles so hard to enjoy himself that he cannot even enjoy the material resources. Thus he is sometimes called //prakṛti,// or //jīva,// for he is situated in the marginal potency. When the living entity is covered with the three modes of material nature, he is called //jīva-saṁjñita.// There are two kinds of living entities: one is called //kṣara,// and the other is //akṣara. Kṣara// refers to those who have fallen down and become conditioned, and //akṣara// refers to those who are not conditioned. The vast majority of living entities live in the spiritual world and are called //akṣara.// They are in the position of Brahman, pure spiritual existence. They are different from those who have been conditioned by the three modes of material nature.

Being above both the //kṣara// and //akṣara,// Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:18|(Bg. 15.18)]] as Puruṣottama. The impersonalists may say that Vāsudeva is the impersonal Brahman, but actually the impersonal Brahman is subordinate to Kṛṣṇa, as also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:27|(Bg. 14.27)]]: //brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham.// That Kṛṣṇa is the source of the impersonal Brahman is also confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.40): //yasya prabhā prabhavato jagadaṇḍa-koṭi.// The impersonal Brahman is nothing but the effulgence or bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa, and in those bodily rays there are innumerable universes floating. Thus in all respects Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Lord, and Lord Śiva is very satisfied with those who are completely surrendered to Him. Complete surrender is desired by Kṛṣṇa, as He indicates in the last chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// The word //sākṣāt,// meaning "directly," is very significant. There are many so-called devotees, but actually they are only //karmīs// and //jñānīs,// for they are not directly devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The //karmīs// sometimes offer the results of their activities to Lord Vāsudeva, and this offering is called //karmārpaṇam.// These are considered to be fruitive activities, for the //karmīs// consider Lord Viṣṇu to be one of the demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. Because they consider Lord Viṣṇu to be on the same level with the demigods, they contend that surrendering to the demigods is as good as surrendering unto Vāsudeva. This contention is denied herein because if it were true, Lord Śiva would have said that surrender unto him, Lord Vāsudeva, Viṣṇu or Brahmā is the same. However, Lord Śiva does not say this because he himself surrenders unto Vāsudeva, and whoever else surrenders unto Vāsudeva is very, very dear to him. This is expressed herein openly. The conclusion is that a devotee of Lord Śiva is not dear to Lord Śiva, but a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is very dear to Lord Śiva.
