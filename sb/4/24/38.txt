===== Purport =====

When the living entity is born with this material world---especially as a human being---he has several obligations unto the demigods, unto the saintly persons and unto living entities in general. As enjoined in the //śāstras: devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṝṇām// (SB 11.5.41). Thus one has an obligation to one's forefathers, the previous hierarchy. Lord Śiva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so he can become free from all obligation to the Pitās, demigods, general living entities and saintly persons and completely engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. As stated:

> devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṝṇāṁ
> na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛṇī ca rājan
> sarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁ
> gato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kartam

One becomes free from all obligations to the demigods, saintly persons, //pitās,// ancient forefathers, etc., if one is completely engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Lord Śiva therefore prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he can be free from such obligations and entirely engage in the Lord's service.

Soma, or the predominating deity of the moon, is responsible for the living entity's ability to relish the taste of food through the tongue. Lord Śiva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he will not taste anything but the //prasāda// of the Lord. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung a verse indicating that the tongue is the most formidable enemy among all the senses. If one can control the tongue, he can easily control the other senses. The tongue can be controlled only by eating //prasāda// offered to the Deity. Lord Śiva's prayer to Lord Aniruddha is meant for this purpose (//tṛpti-dāya//); he prays to Lord Aniruddha to help him be satisfied by eating only //prasāda// offered to the Lord.
