===== Translation =====

**The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, because of their pious nature, all the sons of Prācīnabarhi very seriously accepted the words of their father with heart and soul, and with these words on their heads, they went toward the west to execute their father's order.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse //sādhavaḥ// (meaning "pious" or "well behaved") is very important, especially at the present moment. It is derived from the word //sādhu.// A perfect //sādhu// is one who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prācīnabarhi's sons are described as //sādhavaḥ// because of their complete obedience to their father. The father, king and spiritual master are supposed to be representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such they have to be respected as the Supreme Lord. It is the duty of the father, the spiritual master and the king to regulate their subordinates in such a way that they ultimately become fully unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord. That is the duty of the superiors, and it is the duty of the subordinates to obey their orders perfectly and in a disciplined way. The word //śirasā// ("on their heads") is also significant, for the Pracetās accepted the orders of their father and carried them on their heads, which means they accepted them in complete surrender.
