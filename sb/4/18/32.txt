===== Purport =====

From this statement it appears that town and city planning is not new but has been coming down since the time of King Pṛthu. In India we can see regular planning methods evident in very old cities. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there are many descriptions of such ancient cities. Even five thousand years ago, Lord Kṛṣṇa's capital, Dvārakā, was well planned, and similar other cities---Mathurā and Hastināpura (now New Delhi)---were also well planned. Thus the planning of cities and towns is not a modern innovation but was existing in bygone ages.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Pṛthu Mahārāja Milks the Earth Planet."
