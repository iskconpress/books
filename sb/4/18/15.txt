**All the demigods made Indra, the King of heaven, into a calf, and from the earth they milked the beverage soma, which is nectar. Thus they became very powerful in mental speculation and bodily and sensual strength.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //soma// means "nectar." //Soma// is a kind of beverage made in the heavenly planets from the moon to the kingdoms of the demigods in the various higher planetary systems. By drinking this //soma// beverage the demigods become more powerful mentally and increase their sensual power and bodily strength. The words //hiraṇmayena pātreṇa// indicate that this //soma// beverage is not an ordinary intoxicating liquor. The demigods would not touch any kind of liquor. Nor is //soma// a kind of drug. It is a different kind of beverage, available in the heavenly planets. //Soma// is far different from the liquors made for demoniac people, as explained in the next verse.
