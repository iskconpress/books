===== Purport =====

The word //vṛddha-sevakaḥ// is very significant. //Vṛddha// means "old men." There are two kinds of old men: one is old by age, and another is old by knowledge. This Sanskrit word indicates that one can be older by the advancement of knowledge. King Pṛthu was very respectful to the //brāhmaṇas,// and he protected them. He also protected persons advanced in age. Whatever the King would decide to do, no one would be able to stop. That is called //dṛḍha-saṅkalpa,// or //dṛḍha-vrata.//
