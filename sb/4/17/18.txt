===== Purport =====

The cow-shaped earth addressed King Pṛthu as //dharma jña,// which refers to one who knows the principles of religion. The principles of religion dictate that a woman, a cow, a child, a //brāhmaṇa// and an old man must be given all protection by the king or anyone else. Consequently mother earth took the shape of a cow. She was also a woman. Thus she appealed to the King as one who knows the principles of religion. Religious principles also dictate that one is not to be killed if he surrenders. She reminded King Pṛthu that not only was he an incarnation of God, but he was situated as the King of the earth as well. Therefore his duty was to excuse her.
