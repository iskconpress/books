Information is given herein concerning the selection of the king by the //brāhmaṇas.// According to the //varṇāśrama// system, the //brāhmaṇas// are considered to be the heads of the society and therefore to be situated in the topmost social position. The //varṇāśrama-dharma,// the institution of four //varṇas// and four //āśramas,// is very scientifically designed. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, varṇāśrama-dharma// is not a man-made institution, but is God-made. In this narration it is clearly indicated that the //brāhmaṇas// used to control the royal power. When an evil king like Vena ruled, the //brāhmaṇas// would kill him through their brahminical powers and would select a proper ruler by testing his qualifications. In other words, the //brāhmaṇas,// the intelligent men or great sages, would control the monarchical powers. Here we have an indication of how the //brāhmaṇas// elected King Pṛthu to the throne as the protector of the citizens. The citizens, being skinny due to hunger, approached the King and informed him that necessary action should be taken. The structure of the //varṇāśrama-dharma;// was so nice that the //brāhmaṇas// would guide the head of state. The head of state would then give protection to the citizens. The //kṣatriyas// would take charge of protecting the people in general, and under the protection of the //kṣatriyas,// the //vaiśyas// would protect the cows, produce food grains and distribute them. //Śūdras,// the working class, would help the higher three classes by manual labor. This is the perfect social system.
