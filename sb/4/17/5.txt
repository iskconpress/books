===== Translation =====

**The great saintly King, Mahārāja Pṛthu, received knowledge from Sanat-kumāra, who was the greatest Vedic scholar. After receiving knowledge to be applied practically in his life, how did the saintly King attain his desired destination?**

===== Purport =====

There are four Vaiṣṇava //sampradāyas// (systems) of disciplic succession. One //sampradāya// comes from Lord Brahmā, one from the goddess of fortune, one from the Kumāras, headed by Sanat-kumāra, and one from Lord Śiva. These four systems of disciplic succession are still going on. As King Pṛthu has illustrated, one who is serious about receiving transcendental Vedic knowledge must accept a //guru,// or spiritual master, in one of these four disciplic successions. It is said that unless one accepts a //mantra// from one of these //sampradāyas,// the so-called //mantra// will not act in Kali-yuga. Many //sampradāyas// have sprung up without authority, and they are misleading the people by giving unauthorized //mantras.// The rascals of these so-called //sampradāyas// do not observe the Vedic rules and regulations. Although they are addicted to all kinds of sinful activities, they still offer the people //mantras// and thus mislead them. Intelligent persons, however, know that such //mantras// will never be successful, and as such they never patronize such upstart spiritual groups. People should be very careful of these nonsensical //sampradāyas.// To get some facility for sense gratification, unfortunate people in this age receive //mantras// from these so-called //sampradāyas.// Pṛthu Mahārāja, however, showed by his example that one should receive knowledge from a bona fide //sampradāya.// Therefore Mahārāja Pṛthu accepted Sanat-kumāra as his spiritual master.
