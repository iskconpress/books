===== Purport =====

In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There may be many gods, from Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Indra and Candra down to the rulers of the lower planetary systems, the presidents, ministers, chairmen and kings. In fact, anyone can think that he is God. That is the false, puffed-up conviction of material life. Actually Viṣṇu is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above Viṣṇu, for Viṣṇu is also the plenary portion of a part of Kṛṣṇa. In this verse this is referred to by the word //aṁśāṁśāḥ,// which refers to part and parcel of a part and parcel. There are similar verses in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// which indicate that the Supreme Lord's parts and parcels again expand into other parts and parcels. As described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there are many manifestations of Viṣṇu and many manifestations of living entities. Viṣṇu manifestations are called //svāṁśa,// partial manifestations, and the living entities are called //vibhinnāṁśa.// The demigods like Brahmā and Indra have been promoted to such exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but actually Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa, is the master of everyone. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]. This means that Kṛṣṇa alone is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all others, even the //viṣṇu-tattva// and certainly the living entities, are His servitors. Baladeva is the immediate expansion of Kṛṣṇa. He also engages in the service of Kṛṣṇa, and certainly the ordinary living entities are serving. Everyone is created, constitutionally, for serving Kṛṣṇa. Here the Gandharvas acknowledge that although the demigods may represent themselves as the Supreme, actually they are not supreme. Real supremacy belongs to Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]] is the statement of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:// "Kṛṣṇa is the only Supreme Lord." Worship of Kṛṣṇa alone, therefore, includes worship of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also waters all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers.
