===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly said that //yajña// should be performed for Lord Viṣṇu. Lord Viṣṇu has one thousand popular, transcendental names, out of which one name is Yajña. It is clearly said that everything should be done for the satisfaction of Yajña, or Viṣṇu. All other actions a person may take are only causes for his bondage. Everyone has to perform //yajña// according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the //Upaniṣads,// fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called //cāturmāsya,// the sacrificial animal, and the beverage called //soma// are necessary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the //Vedas// and composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: //āśrāvayeti catur-akṣaraṁ astu śrauṣaḍ iti catur-akṣaraṁ yajeti dvābhyāṁ ye yajāmahaḥ.// These //mantras,// chanted according to the //śruti// and //smṛti// literatures, are only to please Lord Viṣṇu. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned and attached to material enjoyment, performing //yajña// and following the rules and regulations of the four divisions of society and of spiritual life are recommended. It is said in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// that by offering sacrifice to Viṣṇu one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore, is to please Lord Viṣṇu. That is //yajña.// Any person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, the origin of all Viṣṇu forms, and by offering worship and //prasāda// daily, he becomes the best performer of //yajña.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is clearly stated that in this age of Kali the only successful performance of //yajña,// or sacrifice, is //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ:// the best type of sacrifice is simply to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This //yajña// is offered before the form of Lord Caitanya, as other //yajñas// are offered before the form of Lord Viṣṇu. These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Moreover, this //yajña// performance confirms that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Viṣṇu Himself. As Lord Viṣṇu appeared at the Dakṣa //yajña// long, long ago, Lord Caitanya has appeared in this age to accept our //saṅkīrtana-yajña.//
