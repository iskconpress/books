===== Purport =====

Two words are very significant in this verse. //Trayāṇām// indicates "three," namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu. //Bhidām// means "different." They are three, and therefore they are separate, but at the same time they are one. This is the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference, which is called //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.// The example given in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// is that milk and yogurt are simultaneously one and different; both are milk, but the yogurt has become changed. In order to achieve real peace, one should see everything and every living entity, including Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, as nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is independent. Every one of us is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This accounts for unity in diversity. There are diverse manifestations, but, at the same time, they are one in Viṣṇu. Everything is an expansion of Viṣṇu's energy.
