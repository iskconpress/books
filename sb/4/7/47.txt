===== Purport =====

The //brāhmaṇa// priests were very hopeful that their sacrifice would be carried out without obstacles now that Lord Viṣṇu was present. It is significant in this verse that the //brāhmaṇas// say, "Simply by chanting Your holy name we can surpass the obstacles, but now You are personally present." The performance of //yajña// by Dakṣa was obstructed by the disciples and followers of Lord Śiva. The //brāhmaṇas// indirectly criticized the followers of Lord Śiva, but because the //brāhmaṇas// were always protected by Lord Viṣṇu, Śiva's followers could not do any harm to their prosecution of the sacrificial process. There is a saying that when Kṛṣṇa protects someone, no one can do him harm, and when Kṛṣṇa wants to kill someone, no one can protect him. The vivid example was Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa was a great devotee of Lord Śiva, but when Lord Rāmacandra wanted to kill him, Lord Śiva could not protect him. If some demigod, even Lord Śiva or Lord Brahmā, wants to do harm to a devotee, Kṛṣṇa protects the devotee. But when Kṛṣṇa wants to kill someone, such as Rāvaṇa or Hiraṇyakaśipu, no demigod can protect him.
