===== Purport =====

Whenever there is disease in any part of the body, the whole body takes care of the ailing part. Similarly, a devotee's oneness is manifested in His compassion for all conditioned souls. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:18|(Bg. 5.18)]] says, //paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ:// those who are learned see everyone's conditional life equally. Devotees are compassionate to every conditioned soul, and therefore they are known as //apārakya-buddhi.// Because devotees are learned and know that every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, they preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness to everyone so that everyone may be happy. If a particular part of the body is diseased, the whole attention of the body goes to that part. Similarly, devotees care for any person who is forgetful of Kṛṣṇa and therefore in material consciousness. The equal vision of the devotee is that he works to get all living entities back home, back to Godhead.
