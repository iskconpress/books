===== Translation =====

**The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to material contamination, by the curse offered by Lord Śiva's men we have become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and therefore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now involved in the injunctions of the three departments of the Vedic knowledge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajña. We know that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares of the demigods.**

===== Purport =====

The //Vedas// are known as //traiguṇya-viṣayā vedāḥ// [[books:bg:2:45|(Bg. 2.45)]]. Those who are serious students of the //Vedas// are very much attached to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the //Vedas,// and therefore these //veda-vādīs// cannot understand that the ultimate goal of the //Vedas// is to understand Lord Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu. Those who have transcended the qualitative Vedic attractions, however, can understand Kṛṣṇa, who is never contaminated by the material qualities. Therefore Lord Viṣṇu is addressed here as //anañjana// (free from material contamination). In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:42|(Bg. 2.42)]] the crude Vedic scholars have been deprecated by Kṛṣṇa as follows:

> yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ
> pravadanty avipaścitaḥ
> veda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha
> nānyad astīti vādinaḥ

"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the //Vedas,// and they say that there is nothing more than this."
