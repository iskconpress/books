===== Purport =====

In this statement Lord Viṣṇu's all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// that as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //brāhmaṇas'// statement is that Lord Viṣṇu is everything---the fire, the offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the //kuśa.// He is everything. It is confirmed herein that the performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña// in this age is as good as all other //yajñas// in all other ages. If one performs //saṅkīrtana-yajña// by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the //Vedas.// In the chant of the holy names, Hare and Kṛṣṇa, //Hare// means the energy of Kṛṣṇa, and //Kṛṣṇa// is the //viṣṇu-tattva.// Combined together they are everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the //Vedas.// But if one simply chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of //yajña// because there is nothing within our vision except Hare (the energy of Kṛṣṇa) and Kṛṣṇa. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and His energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is Kṛṣṇa. One simply has to accept everything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One should not misunderstand that because everything is Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa has no personal identity. Kṛṣṇa is so full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā,// Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one and different.
