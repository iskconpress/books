Lord Rudra, Śiva, was properly worshiped with his share of the remnants of the //yajña.// Yajña is Viṣṇu, and whatever //prasāda// is offered to Viṣṇu is offered to everyone, even to Lord Śiva. Śrīdhara Svāmī also comments in this connection, //svena bhāgena:// the remnants of the //yajña// are offered to all the demigods and others.
