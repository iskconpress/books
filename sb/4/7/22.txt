===== Purport =====

It appears that Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Lord even of Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, what to speak of the demigods, Gandharvas and ordinary living entities. It is stated in a prayer, //yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutāḥ:// all the demigods worship Lord Viṣṇu. Similarly, //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ:// [SB 12.13.1] //yogīs// concentrate their minds on the form of Lord Viṣṇu. Thus Lord Viṣṇu is worshipable by all demigods, all Gandharvas and even Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. //Tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ:// Viṣṇu is therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though Lord Śiva was previously referred to in prayers by Lord Brahmā as the Supreme, when Lord Viṣṇu appeared, Śiva also fell prostrated before Him to offer respectful obeisances.
