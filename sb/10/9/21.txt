Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yaśodā, is very easily available to devotees, but not to //tapasvīs, yogīs, jñānīs// and others who have a bodily concept of life. Although they may sometimes be called //śānta-bhaktas,// real //bhakti// begins with //dāsya-rasa.// Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:11|(Bg. 4.11)]]:

> ye yathā māṁ prapadyante
> tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham
> mama vartmānuvartante
> manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ

"As living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pṛthā." Everyone is seeking Kṛṣṇa, for He is the Supersoul of all individual souls. Everyone loves his body and wants to protect it because he is within the body as the soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part and parcel of the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happiness by reviving his relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]], //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// "By all the //Vedas,// it is I who am to be known." Therefore, the //karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs// and saintly persons are all seeking Kṛṣṇa. But by following in the footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with Kṛṣṇa, especially the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, one can reach the supreme position of associating with Kṛṣṇa. As it is said, //vṛndāvanaṁ parityajya padam ekaṁ na gacchati:// Kṛṣṇa does not leave Vṛndāvana even for a moment. The //vṛndāvana-vāsīs//---mother Yaśodā, Kṛṣṇa's friends and Kṛṣṇa's conjugal lovers, the younger //gopīs// with whom He dances---have very intimate relationships with Kṛṣṇa, and if one follows in the footsteps of these devotees, Kṛṣṇa is available. Although the //nitya-siddha// expansions of Kṛṣṇa always remain with Kṛṣṇa, if those engaged in //sādhana-siddhi// follow in the footsteps of Kṛṣṇa's //nitya-siddha// associates, such //sādhana-siddhas// also can easily attain Kṛṣṇa without difficulty. But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life. Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, for example, have very prestigious positions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted //īśvaras.// In other words, because Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are //guṇa-avatāras// and have exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like Kṛṣṇa. But the pure devotees who inhabit Vṛndāvana do not possess any bodily conception. They are fully dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection, //premā.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore recommended, //premā pum-artho mahān:// the highest perfection of life is //premā,// pure love in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. And mother Yaśodā appears to be the topmost of devotees who have attained this perfection.
