===== Translation =====

**When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa saw His mother, stick in hand, He very quickly got down from the top of the mortar and began to flee as if very much afraid. Although yogīs try to capture Him as Paramātmā by meditation, desiring to enter into the effulgence of the Lord with great austerities and penances, they fail to reach Him. But mother Yaśodā, thinking that same Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, to be her son, began following Kṛṣṇa to catch Him.**

===== Purport =====

//Yogīs,// mystics, want to catch Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā, and with great austerities and penances they try to approach Him, yet they cannot. Here we see, however, that Kṛṣṇa is going to be caught by Yaśodā and is running away in fear. This illustrates the difference between the //bhakta// and the //yogī. Yogīs// cannot reach Kṛṣṇa, but for pure devotees like mother Yaśodā, Kṛṣṇa is already caught. Kṛṣṇa was even afraid of mother Yaśodā's stick. This was mentioned by Queen Kuntī in her prayers: //bhaya-bhāvanayā sthitasya// [[books:sb:1:8:31|(SB 1.8.31)]]. Kṛṣṇa is afraid of mother Yaśodā, and //yogīs// are afraid of Kṛṣṇa. //Yogīs// try to reach Kṛṣṇa by //jñāna-yoga// and other //yogas,// but fail. Yet although mother Yaśodā was a woman, Kṛṣṇa was afraid of her, as clearly described in this verse.
