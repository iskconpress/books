**While following Kṛṣṇa, mother Yaśodā, her thin waist overburdened by her heavy breasts, naturally had to reduce her speed. Because of following Kṛṣṇa very swiftly, her hair became loose, and the flowers in her hair were falling after her. Yet she did not fail to capture her son Kṛṣṇa.**

//Yogīs// cannot capture Kṛṣṇa by severe penances and austerities, but mother Yaśodā, despite all obstacles, was finally able to catch Kṛṣṇa without difficulty. This is the difference between a //yogī// and a //bhakta. Yogīs// cannot enter even the effulgence of Kṛṣṇa. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣu// (Bs. 5.40). In that effulgence there are millions of universes, but //yogīs// and //jñānīs// cannot enter that effulgence even after many, many years of austerities, whereas //bhaktas// can capture Kṛṣṇa simply by love and affection. This is the example shown here by mother Yaśodā. Kṛṣṇa therefore confirms that if one wants to capture Him, one must undertake devotional service.

//Bhaktas// enter even the planet of Kṛṣṇa very easily, but the less intelligent //yogīs// and //jñānīs,// by their meditation, remain running after Kṛṣṇa. Even if they enter Kṛṣṇa's effulgence, they fall down.
