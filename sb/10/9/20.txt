===== Purport =====

This is a comparative study between mother Yaśodā and other devotees of the Lord. As stated in //Caitanya caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|(Ādi 5.142)]], //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya:// the only supreme master is Kṛṣṇa, and all others are His servants. Kṛṣṇa has the transcendental quality of //bhṛtya-vaśyatā,// becoming subordinate to His //bhṛtya,// or servant. Now, although everyone is //bhṛtya// and although Kṛṣṇa has the quality of becoming subordinate to His //bhṛtya,// the position of mother Yaśodā is the greatest. Lord Brahmā is //bhṛtya,// a servant of Kṛṣṇa, and he is //ādi-kavi,// the original creator of this universe (//tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]). Nonetheless, even he could not obtain such mercy as mother Yaśodā. As for Lord Śiva, he is the topmost Vaiṣṇava (//vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ//). What to speak of Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, is the Lord's constant companion in service, since she always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit was surprised, thinking, "What did mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of Kṛṣṇa?"

In this verse there are three negative pronouncements---//na, na, na.// When anything is uttered three times---"do it, do it, do it"---one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse, we find //na lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire.// Yet mother Yaśodā is in the supermost exalted position, and thus Kṛṣṇa has become completely subordinate to her.

The word //vimuktidāt// is also significant. There are different types of liberation, such as //sāyujya, sālokya, sārūpya, sārṣṭi// and //sāmīpya// [[books:cc:madhya:6:266|[Cc. Madhya 6.266]]], but //vimukti// means "special //mukti.//" When after liberation one is situated on the platform of //prema-bhakti,// one is said to have achieved //vimukti,// "special //mukti.//" Therefore the word //na// is mentioned. That exalted platform of //premā// is described by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as //premā pum-artho mahān,// and mother Yaśodā naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a //nitya-siddha// devotee, an expansion of Kṛṣṇa's //hlādinī// potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are special devotees (//ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]). Such devotees are not //sādhana-siddha.//
