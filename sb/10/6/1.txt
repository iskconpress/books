===== Purport =====

Whenever there is danger, the pure devotee thinks of the protection and shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also advised in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:33|(Bg. 9.33)]]: //anityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām.// In this material world there is danger at every step (//padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]). Therefore a devotee has no other course than to take shelter of the Lord at every step.
