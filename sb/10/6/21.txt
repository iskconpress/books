===== Purport =====

//Nyāsa-mantra// includes //ācamana,// or first drinking a sip of water kept in the right hand. There are different //viṣṇu-mantras// to purify the body. The //gopīs,// and in fact any householders, knew the process for being purified by chanting Vedic hymns. The //gopīs// executed this process first to purify themselves and then to purify the child Kṛṣṇa. One executes the process of //aṅga-nyāsa// and //kara-nyāsa// simply by drinking a little sip of water and chanting the //mantra.// The //mantra// is preceded with the first letter of the name, followed by //anusvāra// and the word //namaḥ: oṁ namo 'jas tavāṅghrī avyāt, maṁ mano maṇimāṁs tava jānunī avyāt,// and so on. By losing Indian culture, Indian householders have forgotten how to execute the //aṅga-nyāsa// and are simply busy in sense gratification, without any advanced knowledge of human civilization.
