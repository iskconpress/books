===== Purport =====

The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but was killed herself is certainly wonderful. Therefore this verse uses the word //adbhutam,// meaning "specifically wonderful." Kṛṣṇa has left us many wonderful narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in //Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,// one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for Govinda, Ādi-puruṣa.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Killing of the Demon Pūtanā."
