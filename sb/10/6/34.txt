Such are the effects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one somehow or other becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by applying his senses in the service of the Lord, one is immediately freed from material contamination. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|(SB 1.2.17)]]. Hearing about the activities of Kṛṣṇa is the beginning of purified life. //Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ:// simply by hearing and chanting, one becomes purified. Therefore, in discharging devotional service, //śravaṇa-kīrtana// (hearing and chanting) is most important. Then, with purified senses, one begins to render service to the Lord (//hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]). //Bhaktir ucyate:// this is called //bhakti.// When Pūtanā was somehow or other, directly or indirectly, induced to render some service to the Lord by feeding Him with her breast, she was immediately purified, so much so that when her nasty material body was burnt to ashes, it gave off the fragrance of //aguru,// the most agreeably scented herb.
