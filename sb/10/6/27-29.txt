{{description>The evil witches known as Ḍākinīs, Yātudhānīs and Kuṣmāṇḍas are the greatest enemies of children, and the evil spirits like Bhūtas, Pretas, Piśācas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas and Vināyakas, as well as witches like Koṭarā, Revatī, Jyeṣṭhā, Pūtanā and Mātṛkā, are always ready to give trouble to the body, the life air and the senses, causing loss of memory, madness and bad dreams.

===== Purport =====

As stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33):

> advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person---nondual, infallible, and without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the //Vedas,// but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees."

While decorating the body with //tilaka,// we give protection to the body by chanting twelve names of Viṣṇu. Although Govinda, or Lord Viṣṇu, is one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But if one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant, "Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu," and always think of Lord Viṣṇu. //Viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param:// this is the highest form of worship. If one remembers Viṣṇu always, even though one is disturbed by many bad elements, one can be protected without a doubt. The //Āyurveda-śāstra// recommends, //auṣadhi cintayet viṣṇum:// even while taking medicine, one should remember Viṣṇu, because the medicine is not all and all and Lord Viṣṇu is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (//padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]). Therefore one must become a Vaiṣṇava and think of Viṣṇu constantly. This is made easier by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ//  [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]// paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam,// and //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.//
