Even in the houses of the cultivators, who were not very advanced in the modern ways of civilization, the ladies used to know how to chant //mantras// to give protection to children with the help of cow dung and cow urine. This was a simple and practical way to give the greatest protection from the greatest dangers. People should know how to do this, for this is a part of Vedic civilization.
