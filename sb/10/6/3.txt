===== Purport =====

Śukadeva Gosvāmī spoke this verse to mitigate the anxiety of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore when he understood that Pūtanā was causing disturbances in Gokula, he was somewhat perturbed. Śukadeva Gosvāmī therefore assured him that there was no danger in Gokula. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung: //nāmāśraya kari' yatane tumi, thākaha āpana kāje.// Everyone is thus advised to seek shelter in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and remain engaged in his own occupational duty. There is no loss in this, and the gain is tremendous. Even from a material point of view, everyone should take to chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// to be saved from all kinds of danger. This world is full of danger (//padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]). Therefore we should be encouraged to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// so that in our family, society, neighborhood and nation, everything will be smooth and free from danger.
