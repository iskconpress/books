===== Purport =====

To a pure devotee, Kṛṣṇa is always visible, as stated in the //Brahmā saṁhitā// (//santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti//) and as indicated by Kṛṣṇa Himself in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ tat sarvato 'kṣi-śiro-mukham//). If by accumulating pious activities (//kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ//  [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]) one is raised to the platform of pure devotional service, Kṛṣṇa is always visible in the core of one's heart. One who has attained such perfection is all-beautiful in transcendental bliss. The present Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an attempt to keep Kṛṣṇa in the center, for if this is done all activities will automatically become beautiful and blissful.
