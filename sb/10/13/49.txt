The word //bhūri-puṇyavad-arpitaiḥ// is significant in this verse. These forms of Viṣṇu were worshiped by those who had performed pious activities (//sukṛtibhiḥ//) for many births and who were constantly engaged in devotional service (//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]). Bhakti, devotional service, is the engagement of those who have performed highly developed pious activities. The accumulation of pious activities has already been mentioned elsewhere in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.12.11), where Śukadeva Gosvāmī says,

> itthaṁ satāṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā
> dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena
> māyāśritānāṁ nara-dārakeṇa
> sākaṁ vijahruḥ kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ

"Those who are engaged in self-realization, appreciating the Brahman effulgence of the Lord, and those engaged in devotional service, accepting the Supreme Personality of Godhead as master, as well as those who are under the clutches of //māyā,// thinking the Lord an ordinary person, cannot understand that certain exalted personalities---after accumulating volumes of pious activities---are now playing with the Lord in friendship as cowherd boys."

In our Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma Temple in Vṛndāvana, there is a //tamāla// tree that covers an entire corner of the courtyard. Before there was a temple the tree was lying neglected, but now it has developed very luxuriantly, covering the whole corner of the courtyard. This is a sign of //bhūri-puṇya.//
