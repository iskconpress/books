===== Purport =====

Brahmā was stunned because of transcendental bliss (//muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ//). In his astonishment, all his senses were stunned, and he was unable to say or do anything. Brahmā had considered himself absolute, thinking himself the only powerful deity, but now his pride was subdued, and he again became merely one of the demigods---an important demigod, of course, but a demigod nonetheless. Brahmā, therefore, cannot be compared to God---Kṛṣṇa, or Nārāyaṇa. It is forbidden to compare Nārāyaṇa even to demigods like Brahmā and Śiva, what to speak of others.

"One who considers demigods like Brahmā and Śiva to be on an equal level with Nārāyaṇa must certainly be considered an offender." We should not equate the demigods with Nārāyaṇa, for even Śaṅkarācārya has forbidden this (//nārāyaṇaḥ paro'vyaktāt//). Also, as mentioned in the //Vedas, eko nārāyaṇa āsīn na brahmā neśānaḥ:// "In the beginning of creation there was only the Supreme Personality, Nārāyaṇa, and there was no existence of Brahmā or Śiva." Therefore, one who at the end of his life remembers Nārāyaṇa attains the perfection of life (//ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:6|[SB 2.1.6]]]).
