===== Purport =====

The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balarāma was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from Kṛṣṇa about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were expansions of Kṛṣṇa. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of //yogamāyā.// There are two //māyās// working under the direction of Kṛṣṇa-//mahāmāyā,// the energy of the material world, and //yogamāyā,// the energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of //yogamāyā.// From the very day on which Brahmā stole the calves and boys, //yogamāyā// acted in such a way that the residents of Vṛndāvana, including even Lord Balarāma, could not understand how //yogamāyā// was working and causing such uncommon things to happen. But as //yogamāyā// gradually acted, Balarāma in particular was able to understand what was happening, and therefore He inquired from Kṛṣṇa.
