While Brahmā was contemplating, all the calves and cowherd boys immediately transformed into //viṣṇu-mūrtis,// having bluish complexions and wearing yellow garments. Brahmā was contemplating his own power and the immense, unlimited power of Kṛṣṇa, but before he could come to a conclusion, he saw this immediate transformation.
