===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //mahimabhiḥ// means //aiśvarya,// or opulence. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can do whatever He likes. That is His //aiśvarya.// No one can command Him, but He can command everyone. //Sad-aiśvarya-pūrṇam.// The Lord is full in six opulences. The //yoga-siddhis,// the perfections of //yoga,// such as the ability to become smaller than the smallest (//aṇimā-siddhi//) or bigger than the biggest (//mahimā-siddhi//), are present in Lord Viṣṇu. //Sad-aiśvaryaiḥ pūrṇo ya iha bhagavān// [[books:cc:adi:1:3|(Cc. Ādi 1.3)]]. The word //ajā// means //māyā,// or mystic power. Everything mysterious is in full existence in Viṣṇu.

The twenty-four elements mentioned are the five working senses (//pañca-karmendriya//), the five senses for obtaining knowledge (//pañca-jñānendriya//), the five gross material elements (//pañca-mahābhūta//), the five sense objects (//pañca-tanmātra//), the mind (//manas//), the false ego (//ahaṅkāra//), the //mahat-tattva,// and material nature (//prakṛti//). All twenty-four of these elements are employed for the manifestation of this material world. The //mahat-tattva// is divided into different subtle categories, but originally it is called the //mahat-tattva.//
