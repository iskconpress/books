===== Purport =====

The //Vedas// (//Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// 6.8) assert that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do personally (//na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate//) because He is doing everything through His energies and potencies (//parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]//). Nonetheless, here we see that He took personal care to find the calves of His friends. This was Kṛṣṇa's causeless mercy. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram: [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]// all the affairs of the entire world and the entire cosmic manifestation are working under His direction, through His different energies. Still, when there is a need to take care of His friends, He does this personally. Kṛṣṇa assured His friends, "Don't be afraid. I am going personally to search for your calves." This was Kṛṣṇa's causeless mercy.
