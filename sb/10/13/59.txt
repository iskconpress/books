===== Purport =====

//Janājīvya-drumākīrṇam:// trees and vegetables are essential, and they give happiness all year round, in all seasons. That is the arrangement in Vṛndāvana. It is not that in one season the trees are pleasing and in another season not pleasing; rather, they are equally pleasing throughout the seasonal changes. Trees and vegetables provide the real means of livelihood recommended for everyone. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|(SB 1.10.4)]]. Trees and vegetables, not industry, provide the real means of life.
