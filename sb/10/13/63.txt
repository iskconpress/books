As stated in one prayer,

> śrutim apare smṛtim itare bhāratam anye bhajantu bhava-bhītāḥ
> aham iha nandaṁ vande yasyālinde paraṁ brahma

"Let others study the //Vedas, smṛti// and //Mahābhārata,// fearing material existence, but I shall worship Nanda Mahārāja, in whose courtyard is crawling the Supreme Brahman. Nanda Mahārāja is so great that the Parabrahman is crawling in his yard, and therefore I shall worship him." (//Padyāvalī// 126)

Brahmā was falling down in ecstasy. Because of the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who exactly resembled a human child, Brahmā was naturally astonished. Therefore with a faltering voice he offered prayers, understanding that here was the Supreme Person.
