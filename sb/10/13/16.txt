Kṛṣṇa could immediately understand that Brahmā had taken away both the calves and the boys, but as an innocent child He searched here and there so that Brahmā could not understand Kṛṣṇa's //māyā.// This was all a dramatic performance. A player knows everything, but still he plays on the stage in such a way that others do not understand him.
