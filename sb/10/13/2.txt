===== Translation =====

**Paramahaṁsas, devotees who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to Kṛṣṇa in the core of their hearts, and He is the aim of their lives. It is their nature to talk only of Kṛṣṇa at every moment, as if such topics were newer and newer. They are attached to such topics, just as materialists are attached to topics of women and sex.**

===== Purport =====

The word //sāra-bhṛtām// means //paramahaṁsas.// The //haṁsa,// or swan, accepts milk from a mixture of milk and water and rejects the water. Similarly, the nature of persons who have taken to spiritual life and Kṛṣṇa consciousness, understanding Kṛṣṇa to be the life and soul of everyone, is that they cannot give up //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or topics about Kṛṣṇa, at any moment. Such //paramahaṁsas// always see Kṛṣṇa within the core of the heart (//santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti//). //Kāma// (desires), //krodha// (anger) and //bhaya// (fear) are always present in the material world, but in the spiritual, or transcendental, world one can use them for Kṛṣṇa. //Kāmaṁ kṛṣṇa-karmārpaṇe.// The desire of the //paramahaṁsas,// therefore, is to act always for Kṛṣṇa. //Krodhaṁ bhakta-dveṣi jane.// They use anger against the nondevotees and transform //bhaya,// or fear, into fear of being deviated from Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this way, the life of a //paramahaṁsa// devotee is used entirely for Kṛṣṇa, just as the life of a person attached to the material world is used simply for women and money. What is day for the materialistic person is night for the spiritualist. What is very sweet for the materialist---namely women and money---is regarded as poison by the spiritualist.

This is the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. For the //paramahaṁsa,// Kṛṣṇa is everything, but for the materialist, women and money are everything.
