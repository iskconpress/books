===== Purport =====

Those Viṣṇu forms blessed the devotees with Their clear glances and smiles, which resembled the increasingly full light of the moon (//śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇam//). As maintainers, They glanced upon Their devotees, embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the desires of the devotees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Actually, in this verse the word //rajaḥ// means not "passion" but "affection." In the material world, //rajo-guṇa// is passion, but in the spiritual world it is affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// but in the //śuddha-sattva// the affection that maintains the devotees is transcendental.

The word //svakārthānām// refers to great desires. As mentioned in this verse, the glance of Lord Viṣṇu creates the desires of the devotees. A pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore Sanātana Gosvāmī comments that because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on Kṛṣṇa have already been fulfilled, the Lord's sidelong glances create variegated desires in relation to Kṛṣṇa and devotional service. In the material world, desire is a product of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// but desire in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting transcendental service. Thus the word //svakārthānām// refers to eagerness to serve Kṛṣṇa.

In Vṛndāvana there is a place where there was no temple, but a devotee desired, "Let there be a temple and //sevā,// devotional service." Therefore, what was once an empty corner has now become a place of pilgrimage. Such are the desires of a devotee.
