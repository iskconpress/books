===== Purport =====

Although Devakī was crying like a very poor woman, actually she was not poor, and therefore the word used here is //dīnavat.// She had already given birth to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, who could have been richer than she? Even the demigods had come to offer prayers to Devakī, but she played the part of a poor, piteously afflicted woman because she wanted to save the daughter of Yaśodā.
