===== Purport =====

When we offer our obeisances to the Personality of Godhead, we say:

> namo brahmaṇya-devāya
> go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

When Kṛṣṇa comes to establish real perfection in the social order, He personally gives protection to the cows and the //brāhmaṇas// (//go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca//). This is His first interest because without protection of the //brāhmaṇas// and the cows, there can be no human civilization and no question of happy, peaceful life. //Asuras,// therefore, are always interested in killing the //brāhmaṇas// and cows. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, cows are being killed all over the world, and as soon as there is a movement to establish brahminical civilization, people in general rebel. Thus they regard the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement as a form of "brainwashing." How can such envious persons be happy in their godless civilization? The Supreme Personality of Godhead punishes them by keeping them in darkness, birth after birth, and pushing them lower and lower into wretched conditions of hellish life. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has started a brahminical civilization, but especially when it is introduced in the Western countries, the //asuras// try to impede it in many ways. Nonetheless, we must push forward this movement tolerantly for the benefit of human society.
