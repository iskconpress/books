There are two different types of men-the //asuras// and the //suras.//

Those who are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa, are //suras,// or //devas,// whereas those who are opposed to the devotees are called //asuras.// Devotees are expert in all transactions (//yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ [SB// 5.18.12]). Therefore they are called //kovida,// which means "expert." //Asuras,// however, although superficially showing expertise in passionate activities, are actually all fools. They are neither sober nor expert. Whatever they do is imperfect. //Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇaḥ.// According to this description of the //asuras// given in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:12|(Bg. 9.12)]], whatever they do will ultimately be baffled. It was such persons who advised Kaṁsa because they were his chief friends and ministers.
