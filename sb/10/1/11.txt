**Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no material body, yet He appears as a human being. For how many years did He live with the descendants of Vṛṣṇi? How many wives did He marry, and for how many years did He live in Dvārakā?**

===== Purport =====

In many places the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], possessing a spiritual, blissful body. His bodily feature is //narākṛti,// that is, exactly like that of a human being. Here the same idea is repeated in the words //mānuṣam āśritya,// which indicate that He accepts a body exactly like that of a man. Everywhere it is confirmed that Kṛṣṇa is never //nirākāra,// or formless. He has His form, exactly like that of a human being. There is no doubt about this.
