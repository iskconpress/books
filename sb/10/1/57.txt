In the Vedic system, as soon as a child is born, especially a male child, the father calls for learned //brāhmaṇas,// and according to the description of the child's horoscope, the child is immediately given a name. This ceremony is called //nāma-karaṇa.// There are ten different //saṁskāras,// or reformatory methods, adopted in the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma,// and the name-giving ceremony is one of them. Although Vasudeva's first son was to be delivered into the hands of Kaṁsa, the //nāma-karaṇa// ceremony was performed, and thus the child was named Kīrtimān. Such names are given immediately after birth.
