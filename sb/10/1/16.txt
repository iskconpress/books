It is said, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// (SB 11.3.21). Those interested in understanding transcendental subject matters as the goal of life must approach the bona fide spiritual master. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta.// One must surrender to such a //guru,// who can give right information about Kṛṣṇa. Herein, Mahārāja Parīkṣit has surrendered to the right personality, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, for enlightenment in //vāsudeva-kathā.// Vāsudeva is the original Personality of Godhead, who has unlimited spiritual activities. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is a record of such activities, and //Bhagavad-gītā// is the record of Vāsudeva speaking personally. Therefore, since the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is full of //vāsudeva-kathā,// anyone who hears, anyone who joins the movement and anyone who preaches will be purified.
