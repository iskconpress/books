The demigods, such as Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, King Indra, Candra and Sūrya, are all subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aside from the demigods, even in human society there are many influential personalities supervising various businesses or establishments. Lord Viṣṇu, however, is the God of gods (//parameśvara//). He is //parama-puruṣa,// the Supreme Being, Paramātmā. As confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.1), //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ:// "Kṛṣṇa, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body." No one is equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He is described here by many words: //jagannātha, deva-deva, vṛṣākapi// and //puruṣa.// The supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:12-13|(Bg. 10.12)]] in this statement by Arjuna:

> paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma
> pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān
> puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam
> ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum

"You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty." Kṛṣṇa is //ādi-puruṣa,// the original Personality of Godhead (//govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi//). Viṣṇu is a plenary expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and all the //viṣṇu-tattvas// are //parameśvara, deva-deva.//
