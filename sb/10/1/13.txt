===== Purport =====

To prepare to meet death in seven days, Mahārāja Parīkṣit gave up all food and drink. As a human being, he was certainly both hungry and thirsty, and therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī might have wanted to stop narrating the transcendental topics of Kṛṣṇa; but despite his fast, Mahārāja Parīkṣit was not at all fatigued. "The hunger and thirst from my fast do not disturb me," he said. "Once when I felt very thirsty, I went to the //āśrama// of Śamīka Muni to drink water, but the //muni// did not supply it. I therefore wrapped a dead snake over his shoulder, and that is why I was cursed by the //brāhmaṇa// boy. Now, however, I am quite fit. I am not at all disturbed by my hunger and thirst." This indicates that although on the material platform there are disturbances from hunger and thirst, on the spiritual platform there is no such thing as fatigue.

The entire world is suffering because of spiritual thirst. Every living being is Brahman, or spirit soul, and needs spiritual food to satisfy his hunger and thirst. Unfortunately, however, the world is completely unaware of the nectar of //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore a boon to philosophers, religionists and people in general. There is certainly a charming attraction in Kṛṣṇa and //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Therefore the Absolute Truth is called Kṛṣṇa, the most attractive.

The word //amṛta// is also an important reference to the moon, and the word //ambuja// means "lotus." The pleasing moonshine and pleasing fragrance of the lotus combined to bring pleasure to everyone hearing //kṛṣṇa-kathā// from the mouth of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. As it is said:

> matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā
> mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām
> adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ
> punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām

"Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. Their inclinations toward Kṛṣṇa are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both." [[books:sb:7:5:30|(SB 7.5.30)]] At the present moment, all of human society is engaged in the business of chewing the chewed (//punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām//). People are prepared to undergo //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]], taking birth in one form, dying, accepting another form and dying again. To stop this repetition of birth and death, //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is absolutely necessary. But unless one hears //kṛṣṇa-kathā// from a realized soul like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, one cannot relish the nectar of //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// which puts an end to all material fatigue, and enjoy the blissful life of transcendental existence. In relation to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we actually see that those who have tasted the nectar of //kṛṣṇa-kathā// lose all material desires, whereas those who cannot understand Kṛṣṇa or //kṛṣṇa-kathā// regard the Kṛṣṇa conscious life as "brainwashing" and "mind control." While the devotees enjoy spiritual bliss, the nondevotees are surprised that the devotees have forgotten material hankerings.
