At the end of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, Śukadeva Gosvāmī summarized the activities of Kṛṣṇa. He spoke of how Kṛṣṇa had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabhūmi-līlā. Parīkṣit Mahārāja, being naturally a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, wanted to hear more about Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, to encourage Śukadeva Gosvāmī to continue speaking about Kṛṣṇa and give further details, he thanked Śukadeva Gosvāmī for having described the activities of Kṛṣṇa in brief. Śukadeva Gosvāmī had said:

> jāto gataḥ pitṛ-gṛhād vrajam edhitārtho
> hatvā ripūn suta-śatāni kṛtorudāraḥ
> utpādya teṣu puruṣaḥ kratubhiḥ samīje
> ātmānam ātma-nigamaṁ prathayañ janeṣu

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as //līlā-puruṣottama,// appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and went to Vṛndāvana to expand His loving relationships with His confidential devotees. In Vṛndāvana the Lord killed many demons, and afterward He returned to Dvārakā, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life." [[books:sb:9:24:66|(SB 9.24.66)]]

The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Parīkṣit Mahārāja gave more respect to the dynasty of the moon-god, the //soma-vaṁśa,// because in the Yādava dynasty, descending from the moon, Kṛṣṇa had appeared. There are two different //kṣatriya// families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the other descending from the king of the sun. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally appears in a //kṣatriya// family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness. According to the Vedic system, the //kṣatriya// family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord Rāmacandra, He appeared in the //sūrya-vaṁśa,// the family descending from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord Kṛṣṇa, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or //yadu-vaṁśa,// whose descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there is a long list of the kings of the //yadu-vaṁśa.// All the kings in both the //soma-vaṁśa// and //sūrya-vaṁśa// were great and powerful, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit praised them very highly (//rājñāṁ cobhaya-vaṁśyānāṁ caritaṁ paramādbhutam//). Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the //soma-vaṁśa// because that was the dynasty in which Kṛṣṇa had appeared.

The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is described in //Brahma-saṁhitā// as the abode of //cintāmaṇi: cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam// [Bs. 5.29]. The Vṛndāvana-dhāma on this earth is a replica of that same abode. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:20|(Bg. 8.20)]], in the spiritual sky there is another, eternal nature, transcendental to manifested and unmanifested matter. The manifested world can be seen in the form of many stars and planets such as the sun and moon, but beyond this is the unmanifested, which is imperceptible to those who are embodied. And beyond this unmanifested matter is the spiritual kingdom, which is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as supreme and eternal. That kingdom is never annihilated. Although material nature is subject to repeated creation and annihilation, that spiritual nature remains as it is eternally. In the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that spiritual nature, the spiritual world, is described as Vṛndāvana, Goloka Vṛndāvana or Vraja-dhāma. The elaborate description of the above-mentioned //śloka// from the Ninth Canto---//jāto gataḥ pitṛ-gṛhād// [[books:sb:9:24:66|(SB 9.24.66)]]---will be found here, in the Tenth Canto.
