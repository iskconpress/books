//Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// (//Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// 6.8 [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]). In the //Vedas// it is said that the potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called by different names, such as //yogamāyā// and //mahāmāyā.// Ultimately, however, the Lord's potency is one, exactly as electric potency is one although it can act both to cool and to heat. The Lord's potency acts in both the spiritual and material worlds. In the spiritual world the Lord's potency works as //yogamāyā,// and in the material world the same potency works as //mahāmāyā,// exactly as electricity works in both a heater and a cooler. In the material world, this potency, working as //mahāmāyā,// acts upon the conditioned souls to deprive them more and more of devotional service. It is said, //yayā sammohito jīva ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam// [[books:sb:1:7:5|[SB 1.7.5]]]. In the material world the conditioned soul thinks of himself as a product of //tri-guṇa,// the three modes of material nature. This is the bodily conception of life. Because of associating with the three //guṇas// of the material potency, everyone identifies himself with his body. Someone is thinking he is a //brāhmaṇa,// someone a //kṣatriya,// and someone a //vaiśya// or //śūdra.// Actually, however, one is neither a //brāhmaṇa,// a //kṣatriya,// a //vaiśya// nor a //śūdra;// one is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord (//mamaivāṁśaḥ//), but because of being covered by the material energy, //mahāmāyā,// one identifies himself in these different ways. When the conditioned soul becomes liberated, however, he thinks himself an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. //Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya-kṛṣṇera 'nitya-dāsa.'// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. When he comes to that position, the same potency, acting as //yogamāyā,// increasingly helps him become purified and devote his energy to the service of the Lord.

In either case, whether the soul is conditioned or liberated, the Lord is supreme. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]], //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:// it is by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the material energy, //mahāmāyā,// works upon the conditioned soul.

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate

"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature." [[books:bg:3:27|(Bg. 3.27)]] Within conditioned life, no one has freedom, but because one is bewildered, being subject to the rule of //mahāmāyā,// one foolishly thinks himself independent (//ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]). But when the conditioned soul becomes liberated by executing devotional service, he is given a greater and greater chance to relish a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in different transcendental statuses, such as //dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa// and //mādhurya-rasa.//

Thus the Lord's potency, //viṣṇu-māyā,// has two features---//āvaraṇikā// and //unmukha.// When the Lord appeared, His potency came with Him and acted in different ways. She acted as //yogamāyā// with Yaśodā, Devakī and other intimate relations of the Lord, and she acted in a different way with Kaṁsa, Śālva and other //asuras.// By the order of Lord Kṛṣṇa, His potency //yogamāyā// came with Him and exhibited different activities according to the time and circumstances. //Kāryārthe sambhaviṣyati. Yogamāyā// acted differently to execute different purposes desired by the Lord. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:13|(Bg. 9.13)]], //mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ.// The //mahātmās,// who fully surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, are directed by //yogamāyā,// whereas the //durātmās,// those who are devoid of devotional service, are directed by //mahāmāyā.//
