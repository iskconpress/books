The spiritual master is sometimes glorified as //sarva-devamayo guruḥ// (SB 11.17.27). By the grace of the //guru,// the spiritual master, one can understand the different kinds of //devas.// The word //deva// refers to God, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original source of all the demigods, who are also called //devas.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:2|(Bg. 10.2)]] the Lord says, //aham ādir hi devānām:// "I am the source of all the //devas.//" The Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, the Original person, expands in different forms. //Tad aikṣata bahu syām// (//Chāndogya Upaniṣad// 6.2.3). He alone has expanded into many. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// (Bs. 5.33). There are different grades of forms, known as //svāṁśa// and //vibhinnāṁśa.// The //svāṁśa// expansions, or //viṣṇu-tattva,// are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the //vibhinnāṁśa// are //jīva-tattva,// who are part and parcel of the Lord (//mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]). If we accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him, all the parts and expansions of the Lord are automatically worshiped. //Sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā// [[books:sb:4:31:14|(SB 4.31.14)]]. Kṛṣṇa is known as Acyuta (//senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta// [[books:bg:1:21-22|[Bg. 1.21]]]). By worshiping Acyuta, Kṛṣṇa, one automatically worships all the demigods. There is no need of separately worshiping either the //viṣṇu-tattva// or //jīva-tattva.// If one concentrates upon Kṛṣṇa, one worships everyone. Therefore, because mother Devakī gave birth to Kṛṣṇa, she is described here as //sarva-devatā.//
