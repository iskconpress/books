In this verse the words //kṛṣṇa-caritaṁ kali-kalmaṣa-ghnam// indicate that the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa are certainly the greatest panacea for all miseries, especially in this age of Kali. It is said that in Kali-yuga people have only short lives, and they have no culture of spiritual consciousness. If anyone is at all interested in spiritual culture, he is misled by many bogus //svāmīs// and //yogīs// who do not refer to //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Therefore most people are unfortunate and disturbed by many calamities. Śrīla Vyāsadeva prepared //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// at the request of Nārada Muni in order to give relief to the suffering people of this age (//kali-kalmaṣa-ghnam//). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is seriously engaged in enlightening people through the pleasing topics of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// All over the world, the message of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Bhagavad-gītā// is being accepted in all spheres of life, especially in advanced, educated circles.

Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī is described in this verse as //bhāgavata-pradhānaḥ,// whereas Mahārāja Parīkṣit is described as //viṣṇu-rātam.// Both words bear the same meaning; that is, Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī was also a great saintly person and a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Combined together to present //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// they give great relief to suffering humanity.

"The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyāsadeva compiled this Vedic literature, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is in relation to the Supreme Truth." [[books:sb:1:7:6|(SB 1.7.6)]] People in general are unaware that the message of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// can give all of human society relief from the pangs of Kali-yuga (//kali-kalmaṣa-ghnam//).
