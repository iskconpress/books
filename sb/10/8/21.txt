One //brāhmaṇa// devotee says:

> śrutim apare smṛtim itare bhāratam anye bhajantu bhava-bhītāḥ
> aham iha nandaṁ vande yasyālinde paraṁ brahma

"Let others, fearing material existence, worship the //Vedas,// the Vedic supplementary //purāṇas// and the //Mahābhārata,// but I shall worship Nanda Mahārāja, in whose courtyard the Supreme Brahman is crawling." For a highly exalted devotee, //kaivalya,// merging into the existence of the Supreme, appears no better than hell (//narakāyate//). But here one can simply think of the crawling of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in the courtyard of Nanda Mahārāja and always merge in transcendental happiness. As long as one is absorbed in thoughts of //kṛṣṇa-līlā,// especially Kṛṣṇa's childhood pastimes, as Parīkṣit Mahārāja desired to be, one is always merged in actual //kaivalya.// Therefore Vyāsadeva compiled //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām// [[books:sb:1:7:6|(SB 1.7.6)]]. Vyāsadeva compiled //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// under the instruction of Nārada, so that anyone can take advantage of this literature, think of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes and always be liberated.
