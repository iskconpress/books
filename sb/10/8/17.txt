===== Purport =====

Indra is the king of the universe. Demons, thieves and rogues always disturb Indra (//indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokam//), but when //indrāris,// the enemies of Indra, become prominent, Kṛṣṇa appears. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayaṁ/ indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge// [[books:sb:1:3:28|(SB 1.3.28)]].
