For the cowherd men and the cows, Kṛṣṇa is the supreme friend. Therefore He is worshiped by the prayer //namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// His pastimes in Gokula, His //dhāma,// are always favorable to the //brāhmaṇas// and the cows. His first business is to give all comfort to the cows and the //brāhmaṇas.// In fact, comfort for the //brāhmaṇas// is secondary, and comfort for the cows is His first concern. Because of His presence, all people would overcome all difficulties and always be situated in transcendental bliss.
