Baladeva was actually the son of Devakī, but He was transferred from Devakī's womb to that of Rohiṇī. This fact was not disclosed. According to a statement in the //Hari-vaṁśa://

> pratyuvāca tato rāmaḥ
> sarvāṁs tān abhitaḥ sthitān
> yādaveṣv api sarveṣu
> bhavanto mama vallabhāḥ

Gargamuni did disclose to Nanda Mahārāja that Balarāma would be known as Saṅkarṣaṇa because of uniting two families---the //yadu-vaṁśa// and the //vaṁśa// of Nanda Mahārāja---one of which was known as //kṣatriya// and the other as //vaiśya.// Both families had the same original forefather, the only difference being that Nanda Mahārāja was born of a //vaiśya// wife whereas Vasudeva was born of a //kṣatriya// wife. Later, Nanda Mahārāja married a //vaiśya// wife, and Vasudeva married a //kṣatriya// wife. So although the families of Nanda Mahārāja and Vasudeva both came from the same father, they were divided as //kṣatriya// and //vaiśya.// Now Baladeva united them, and therefore He was known as Saṅkarṣaṇa.
