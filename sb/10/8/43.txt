===== Translation =====

**Mother Yaśodā, by the grace of the Lord, could understand the real truth. But then again, the supreme master, by the influence of the internal potency, yogamāyā, inspired her to become absorbed in intense maternal affection for her son.**

===== Purport =====

Although mother Yaśodā understood the whole philosophy of life, at the next moment she was overwhelmed by affection for her son by the influence of //yogamāyā.// Unless she took care of her son Kṛṣṇa, she thought, how could He be protected? She could not think otherwise, and thus she forgot all her philosophical speculations. This forgetfulness is described by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura as being inspired by the influence of //yogamāyā// (//mohana-sādharmyān māyām//). Materialistic persons are captivated by //mahāmāyā,// whereas devotees, by the arrangement of the spiritual energy, are captivated by //yogamāyā.//
