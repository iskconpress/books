Here is another of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental activities invented to please the //gopīs.// First a complaint was lodged with mother Yaśodā about Kṛṣṇa's stealing, but mother Yaśodā did not chastise Him. Now, in an attempt to awaken mother Yaśodā's anger so that she would chastise Kṛṣṇa, another complaint was invented-that Kṛṣṇa had eaten earth.
