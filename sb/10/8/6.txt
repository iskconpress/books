The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]], //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:// the four //varṇas-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//---must be present in society. The //brāhmaṇas// are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as //varṇāśrama-dharma// and if human society has no such guide as the //brāhmaṇa,// human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at the present moment, there is no such thing as a real //brāhmaṇa,// and therefore society is in a chaotic condition. Formerly there were qualified //brāhmaṇas,// but at present, although there are certainly persons who think themselves //brāhmaṇas,// they actually have no ability to guide society. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore very much eager to reintroduce the //varṇāśrama// system into human society so that those who are bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified //brāhmaṇas.//

//Brāhmaṇa// means Vaiṣṇava. After one becomes a //brāhmaṇa,// the next stage of development in human society is to become a Vaiṣṇava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must understand Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this principle, but people have lost the clue (//na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]), and they are simply pursuing sense gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a lower grade of life (//mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]). It doesn't matter whether one is born a //brāhmaṇa// or not. No one is born a //brāhmaṇa;// everyone is born a //śūdra.// But by the guidance of a //brāhmaṇa// and by //saṁskāra,// one can become //dvija,// twice-born, and then gradually become a //brāhmaṇa.// Brāhmaṇism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated so as to become a //brāhmaṇa.// At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of life. Regardless of whether one is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, a //kṣatriya// family or a //śūdra// family, one may be guided by a proper //brāhmaṇa// and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vaiṣṇava. Thus the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Mahārāja took advantage of the opportunity of Gargamuni's presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life.
