Partially explaining the position of Lord Kṛṣṇa and partially covering the facts, Gargamuni indicated, "Your son is a great personality, and He can change the color of His body in different ages." The word //gṛhṇataḥ// indicates that Kṛṣṇa is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different millenniums are stated, and therefore when Gargamuni said, "Your son has assumed these colors," he indirectly said, "He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Because of Kaṁsa's atrocities, Gargamuni tried to avoid disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Mahārāja that Kṛṣṇa, his son, was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

It may be noted that Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, in his book //Krama-sandarbha,// has enunciated the purport of this verse. In every millennium, Kṛṣṇa appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Gargamuni, exhibited the power of Nārāyaṇa. Because in this form the Supreme Personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the all-attractive.

Factually, Kṛṣṇa is the source of all //avatāras,// and therefore all the different features of the different //avatāras// are present in Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him. Other incarnations are partial representations of Kṛṣṇa, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as //śukla, rakta// or //pīta// (white, red or yellow), is the same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine, which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine is observed mainly as bright light. The different //avatāras,// such as the //manvantara-avatāras, līlā-avatāras// and //daśa-avatāras,// are all included in the //kṛṣṇa-avatāra.// When Kṛṣṇa appears, all the //avatāras// appear with Him. As described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:3:26|(1.3.26)]]:

> avatārā hy asaṅkhyeyā
> hareḥ sattva-nidher dvijāḥ
> yathāvidāsinaḥ kulyāḥ
> sarasaḥ syuḥ sahasraśaḥ

The //avatāras// incessantly appear, like incessantly flowing water. No one can count how many waves there are in flowing water, and similarly there is no limitation of the //avatāras.// And Kṛṣṇa is the full representation of all //avatāras// because He is the source of all //avatāras.// Kṛṣṇa is //aṁśī,// whereas others are //aṁśa,// part of Kṛṣṇa. All living entities, including us, are //aṁśas// (//mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]). These //aṁśas// are of different magnitude. Human beings (who are minute //aṁśas//) and the demigods, //viṣṇu-tattva// and all other living beings are all part of the Supreme. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// (//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13). Kṛṣṇa is the full representation of all living entities, and when Kṛṣṇa is present, all //avatāras// are included in Him.

The Eleventh Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// describes the incarnations for each //yuga// in chronological order. The //Bhāgavatam// says, //kṛte śuklaś catur-bāhuḥ, tretāyāṁ rakta-varṇo'sau, dvāpare bhagavān śyāmaḥ// and //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam// [SB 11.5.32]. We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagavān has appeared in //pīta-varṇa,// or a yellow color, as Gaurasundara, although the //Bhāgavatam// speaks of //kṛṣṇa-varṇam.// To adjust all these statements, one should understand that although in some //yugas// some of the colors are prominent, in every //yuga,// whenever Kṛṣṇa appears, all the colors are present. //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam:// although Caitanya Mahāprabhu appears without //kṛṣṇa,// or a blackish color, He is understood to be Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ.// The same original Kṛṣṇa who appears in different //varṇas// has now appeared. The word //āsan// indicates that He is always present. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in His full feature, He is understood to be //kṛṣṇa-varṇam,// although He appears in different colors. Prahlāda Mahārāja states that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //channa;// that is, although He is Kṛṣṇa, He is covered by a yellow color. Thus the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas accept the conclusion that although Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in //pīta// color, He is Kṛṣṇa.
