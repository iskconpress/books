===== Purport =====

Unless delivered or blessed by a devotee, one cannot realize that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.// According to this verse of //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:3|(Bg. 7.3)]], there are so many //siddhas// or //yogīs// who cannot understand Kṛṣṇa; instead, they misunderstand Him. But if one takes shelter of a devotee descending from the //paramparā// system of Nārada (//svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]), one can then understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations are advertised simply for having exhibited some magical performances, but except for persons who are servants of Nārada and other servants of Kṛṣṇa, no one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. //Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// no one is delivered from the material conception of life unless favored by a Vaiṣṇava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by any other bodily or mental gymnastics.
