If by chance one meets a //sādhu,// a devotee, one's life is immediately successful, and one is freed from material bondage. It may be argued that whereas someone may receive a //sādhu// with great respect, someone else may not receive a //sādhu// with such respect. A //sādhu,// however, is always equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a pure devotee, a //sādhu// is always ready to deliver Kṛṣṇa consciousness without discrimination. As soon as one sees a //sādhu,// one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, persons who are too much offensive, who commit //vaiṣṇava-aparādhas,// or offenses to a //sādhu,// will have to take some time before being rectified. This is also indicated herein.
