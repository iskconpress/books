===== Translation =====

**While living one may be proud of one's body, thinking oneself a very big man, minister, president or even demigod, but whatever one may be, after death this body will turn either into worms, into stool or into ashes. If one kills poor animals to satisfy the temporary whims of this body, one does not know that he will suffer in his next birth, for such a sinful miscreant must go to hell and suffer the results of his actions.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the three words //kṛmi-vid-bhasma// are significant. After death, the body may become //kṛmi,// which means "worms," for if the body is disposed of without cremation, it may be eaten by worms; or else it may be eaten by animals like hogs and vultures and be turned into stool. Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and thus it becomes ashes (//bhasma-saṁjñitam//). Yet although the body will be turned into worms, stool or ashes, foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of body is actually meant for //jīvasya tattva jijñāsā,// enlightenment in knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, one must seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta:// one must approach a //guru.// Who is a //guru? Śābde pare ca niṣṇātam// (SB 11.3.21): a //guru// is one who has full transcendental knowledge. Unless one approaches a spiritual master, one remains in ignorance. //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda// (//Chāndogya Upaniṣad// 6.14.2): one has full knowledge about life when one is //ācāryavān,// controlled by the //ācārya.// But when one is conducted by //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// one does not care about anything; instead, one acts like an ordinary foolish animal, risking his life (//mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]) and therefore continuing to go through suffering after suffering. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|(SB 7.5.31)]]. Such a foolish person does not know how to elevate himself in this body. Instead, he indulges in sinful activities and goes deeper and deeper into hellish life.
