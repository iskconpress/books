===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The two young demigods thus offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Godhead, is the master of all and was certainly Gokuleśvara, the master of Gokula, He was bound to the wooden mortar by the ropes of the gopīs, and therefore, smiling widely, He spoke to the sons of Kuvera the following words.**

===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa was smiling because He was thinking to Himself, "These two young demigods fell from the higher planetary system to this planet, and I have delivered them from the bondage of standing for a long time as trees, but as for Me, I am bound by the ropes of the //gopīs// and am subject to their chastisements." In other words, Kṛṣṇa submits to being chastised and bound by the //gopīs// because of pure love and affection worthy of being praised by a devotee in so many ways.
