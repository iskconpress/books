===== Purport =====

When a //sādhu// chastises or punishes someone, he does not do so for revenge. Mahārāja Parīkṣit had inquired why Nārada Muni was subject to such a spirit of revenge (//tamaḥ//). But this was not //tamaḥ,// for Nārada Muni, in full knowledge of what was for the good of the two brothers, wisely thought of how to cure them. Vaiṣṇavas are good physicians. They know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never in //tamo-guṇa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]. Vaiṣṇavas are always situated on the transcendental platform, the Brahman platform. They cannot be subject to mistakes or the influence of the modes of material nature. Whatever they do, after full consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to Godhead.
