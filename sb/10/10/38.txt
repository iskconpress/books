May our heads offer our obeisances to everything within this world, because all things are also Your different forms, and may our eyes see the forms of Vaiṣṇavas, who are nondifferent from You.}}

Here the process of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is given. This process is //bhakti.//

Everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]] (//Nārada-pañcarātra//). Everything---the mind, the body and all the sense organs---should be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. This is to be learned from expert devotees like Nārada, Svayambhū and Śambhu. This is the process. We cannot manufacture our own way of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is not that everything one manufactures or concocts will lead to understanding God. Such a proposition---//yata mata, tata patha//---is foolish. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ:// "Only by executing the activities of //bhakti// can one understand Me." (SB 11.14.21) This is called //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]], remaining engaged favorably in the service of the Lord.
