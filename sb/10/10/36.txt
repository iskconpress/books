===== Purport =====

The word //parama-kalyāṇa// is significant because Kṛṣṇa, in any of His incarnations, appears in order to protect the //sādhus// (//paritrāṇāya sādhūnām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]). The //sādhus,// saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed by nondevotees, and Kṛṣṇa appears in His incarnations to give them relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Kṛṣṇa's life, we shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing demons one after another.
