===== Purport =====

As it is said:

> ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi
> na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ
> sevonmukhe hi jihvādau
> svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]

Kṛṣṇa's name, attributes and form are Absolute Truth, existing before the creation. Therefore, how can those who are created---that is, those entrapped in bodies created of material elements---understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly? This is not possible. But, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:// Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself to those engaged in devotional service. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:15|(Bg. 18.15)]] by the Lord Himself: //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.// Even the descriptions of Kṛṣṇa in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional activities. The more one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him as He is. If from the material platform one could understand Kṛṣṇa, then, since Kṛṣṇa is everything (//sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma//), one could understand Kṛṣṇa by seeing anything within this material world. But that is not possible.

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]]

Everything is resting on Kṛṣṇa, and everything is Kṛṣṇa, but this is not to be realized by persons on the material platform.
