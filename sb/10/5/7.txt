The Supreme Personality of Godhead has instructed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:44|(Bg. 18.44)]], //kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma-svabhāvajam:// "Farming, cow protection and trade are the qualities of work for the //vaiśyas.//" anda Mahārāja belonged to the //vaiśya// community, the agriculturalist community. How to protect the cows and how rich this community was are explained in these verses. We can hardly imagine that cows, bulls and calves could be cared for so nicely and decorated so well with cloths and valuable golden ornaments. How happy they were. As described elsewhere in the //Bhāgavatam,// during Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's time the cows were so happy that they used to muddy the pasturing ground with milk. This is Indian civilization. Yet in the same place, India, Bhārata-varṣa, how much people are suffering by giving up the Vedic way of life and not understanding the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā.//
