===== Purport =====

Although it has become fashionable to speak of //daridra-nārāyaṇa,// the words //viṣṇor ārādhanārthāya// do not mean that all the people satisfied by Nanda Mahārāja in this great ceremony were Viṣṇus. They were not //daridra,// nor were they Nārāyaṇa. Rather, they were devotees of Nārāyaṇa, and by their educational qualifications they would satisfy Nārāyaṇa. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. //Mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā// (SB 11.19.21). The Lord says, "Worshiping My devotees is better than worshiping Me directly." The //varṇāśrama// system is entirely meant for //viṣṇu-ārādhana,// worship of Lord Viṣṇu. //Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān/ viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]] (//Viṣṇu Purāṇa// 3.8.9). The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord. The uncivilized man or materialistic person, however, does not know this aim of life. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|(SB 7.5.31)]]. One's real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. Not satisfying Lord Viṣṇu but instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (//bahir-artha-māninaḥ//) is the wrong way for happiness. Because Viṣṇu is the root of everything, if Viṣṇu is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one's children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Mahārāja wanted to see his newborn child happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu, and to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu it was necessary to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned //brāhmaṇas, māgadhas// and //sūtas.// Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately it was Lord Viṣṇu who was to be satisfied.
