===== Purport =====

The description of the //gopīs,// who were going to the house of Mahārāja Nanda to welcome Kṛṣṇa, is especially significant. The //gopīs// were not ordinary women, but expansions of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency, as described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.37,29):

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> (5.37)
>
> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> (5.29)

Kṛṣṇa is always worshiped by the //gopīs// wherever He goes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is so vividly described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also described Kṛṣṇa in this way: //ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.// All these //gopīs// were going to offer Kṛṣṇa their presentations because the //gopīs// are eternal associates of the Lord. Now the //gopīs// were more jubilant because of the news of Kṛṣṇa's appearance in Vṛndāvana.
