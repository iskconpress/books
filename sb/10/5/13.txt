The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:7|(Bg. 4.7)]]:

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> abhyutthānam adharmasya
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham

"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion---at that time I descend Myself." Whenever Kṛṣṇa comes, once in a day of Brahmā, He comes to the house of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa is the master of all creation (//sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]). Therefore, not only in the neighborhood of Nanda Mahārāja's estate, but all over the universe---and in all the other universes---musical sounds celebrated the auspicious arrival of the Lord.
