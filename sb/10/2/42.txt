===== Purport =====

It is said:

> adyāpiha caitanya ei saba līlā kare
> yāṅ'ra bhāgye thāke, se dekhaye nirantare
> (//Caitanya-bhāgavata, Madhya// 23.513)

The incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear continuously, like the waves of a river or an ocean. There is no limit to the Lord's incarnations, but they can be perceived only by devotees who are fortunate. The //devatās,// the demigods, fortunately understood the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus they offered their prayers. Then Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā led the demigods in returning to their homes.

The word //kukṣi-gataḥ,// meaning "within the womb of Devakī," has been discussed by Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī in his //Krama-sandarbha// commentary. Since it was said at first that Kṛṣṇa was present within the heart of Vasudeva and was transferred to the heart of Devakī, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī writes, how is it that Kṛṣṇa was now in the womb? He replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.35), //aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// The Lord can stay wherever He likes. Devakī, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devakī-nandana.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Second Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Prayers by the Demigods for Lord Kṛṣṇa in the Womb."
