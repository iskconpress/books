**Devakī then kept within herself the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the foundation of the entire cosmos, but because she was under arrest in the house of Kaṁsa, she was like the flames of a fire covered by the walls of a pot, or like a person who has knowledge but cannot distribute it to the world for the benefit of human society.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //jñāna-khala// is most significant. Knowledge is meant for distribution. Although there is already much scientific knowledge, whenever scientists or philosophers awaken to a particular type of knowledge, they try to distribute it throughout the world, for otherwise the knowledge gradually dries up and no one benefits from it. India has the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but unfortunately, for some reason or other, this sublime knowledge of the science of God was not distributed throughout the world, although it is meant for all of human society. Therefore Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and ordered all Indians to take up the cause of distributing the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// throughout the entire world.

"Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as they are given in //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land." [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|(Cc. Madhya 7.128)]] Although India has the sublime knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā,// Indians have not done their proper duty of distributing it. Now, therefore, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been set up to distribute this knowledge as it is, without distortion. Although previously there were attempts to distribute the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā,// these attempts involved distortion and compromise with mundane knowledge. But now the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, without mundane compromises, is distributing //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, and people are deriving the benefits of awakening to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becoming devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the proper distribution of knowledge has begun by which not only will the whole world benefit, but India's glory will be magnified in human society. Kaṁsa tried to arrest Kṛṣṇa consciousness within his house (//bhojendra-gehe//), with the result that Kaṁsa, with all his opulences, was later vanquished. Similarly, the real knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// was being choked by unscrupulous Indian leaders, with the result that India's culture, and knowledge of the Supreme were being lost. Now, however, because Kṛṣṇa consciousness is spreading, the proper use of //Bhagavad-gītā// is being attempted.
