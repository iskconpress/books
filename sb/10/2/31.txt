This statement reveals how the merciful //ācāryas// and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in His teachings to Rūpa Gosvāmī, said:

> brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|(Cc. Madhya 19.151)]]

One can achieve the seed of //bhakti-latā,// devotional service, by the mercy of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. The duty of the //guru// is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to render devotional service, which Kṛṣṇa accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks shelter of such a //guru,// or //ācārya,// who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The //ācārya's// duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees may render service according to references from //śāstra.// Rūpa Gosvāmī, for example, in order to help subsequent devotees, published such devotional books as //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// Thus it is the duty of the //ācārya// to publish books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities---illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling---and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, but should follow this method. Kṛṣṇa will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The //ācārya// gives the suitable method for crossing the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called //ācārya-sampradāya.// It is therefore said, //sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā matāḥ// (//Padma Purāṇa//). The //ācārya-sampradāya// is strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the //ācārya-sampradāya;// otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore sings:

> tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta sane vāsa
> janame janame haya, ei abhilāṣa

One must worship the lotus feet of the //ācārya// and live within the society of devotees. Then one's endeavor to cross over nescience will surely be successful.
