===== Purport =====

"All the inhabitants of the palace" includes Kaṁsa. When everyone lamented, Kaṁsa joined in compassion, thinking that perhaps because of drugs or some other external means, Devakī had undergone this abortion. The real story of what happened after Yogamāyā attracted the child of Devakī into the womb of Rohiṇī in the seventh month of Rohiṇī's pregnancy is described as follows in the //Hari-vaṁśa.// At midnight, while Rohiṇī was deeply sleeping, she experienced, as if in a dream, that she had undergone a miscarriage. After some time, when she awoke, she saw that this had indeed happened, and she was in great anxiety. But Yogamāyā then informed her, "O auspicious lady, your child is now being replaced. I am attracting a child from the womb of Devakī, and therefore your child will be known as Saṅkarṣaṇa."

The word //yoga-nidrā// is significant. When one is spiritually reconnected through self-realization, one regards his material life as having been like a dream. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:69|(Bg. 2.69)]]:

> yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī
> yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni
> sā niśā paśyato muneḥ

"What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage." The stage of self-realization is called //yoga-nidrā.// All material activities appear to be a dream when one is spiritually awakened. Thus //yoga-nidrā// may be explained to be Yogamāyā.
