As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:20|(Bg. 7.20)]], //kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ:// "Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods." Therefore the word //manuṣya,// meaning "human being," here refers to one who does not know the actual goal of life. Such a person wants to enjoy the material world by taking birth in a highly elevated family with the benefits of education, beauty and immense wealth, which in this material world are desirable. One who has forgotten the real aim of life may worship goddess Durgā, //māyā-śakti,// under various names, for different purposes, and in different places. As there are many holy places for the worship of Kṛṣṇa, there are also many holy places in India for the worship of Durgādevī, or Māyādevī, who took birth as the daughter of Yaśodā. After cheating Kaṁsa, Māyādevī dispersed herself to various places, especially in Vindhyācala, to accept regular worship from ordinary men. A human being should actually be interested in understanding //ātma-tattva,// the truth of //ātmā,// the spirit soul, and Paramātmā, the supreme soul. Those who are interested in //ātma-tattva// worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati//) (//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3). However, as explained in the next verse of this chapter, those who cannot understand //ātma-tattva// (//apaśyatām ātma-tattvam//) worship Yogamāyā in her different features. Therefore //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|(2.1.2)]] says:

> śrotavyādīni rājendra
> nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ
> apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ
> gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām

"Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." Those who are interested in remaining in this material world and are not interested in spiritual salvation have many duties, but for one who is interested in spiritual salvation, the only duty is to surrender fully unto Kṛṣṇa (//sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]). Such a person is not interested in material enjoyment.
