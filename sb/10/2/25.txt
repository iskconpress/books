//Dvau bhūta-sargau loke 'smin daiva āsura eva ca//  [[books:bg:16:6|[Bg. 16.6]]] (//Padma Purāṇa//). There are two classes of men---the //daivas// and the //asuras//---and there is a great difference between them. Kaṁsa, being an //asura,// was always planning how to kill the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His mother, Devakī. Thus he was also Kṛṣṇa conscious. But devotees are Kṛṣṇa conscious favorably (//viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daivaḥ//). Brahmā is so powerful that he is in charge of creating an entire universe, yet he personally came to receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhava, Lord Śiva, is always jubilant in chanting the holy name of the Lord. And what to speak of Nārada? //Nārada-muni, bājāya vīṇā, rādhikā-ramaṇa-nāme.// Nārada Muni is always chanting the glories of the Lord, and his engagement is to travel all over the universe and find a devotee or make someone a devotee. Even a hunter was made a devotee by the grace of Nārada. Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, in his //Toṣaṇī,// says that the word //nārada-ādibhiḥ// means that Nārada and the demigods were accompanied by other saintly persons, like Sanaka and Sanātana, all of whom came to congratulate or welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though Kaṁsa was planning to kill Devakī, he too awaited the arrival of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//pratīkṣaṁs taj janma//).
