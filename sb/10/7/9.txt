===== Purport =====

We have heard of people's being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt. The Śakaṭāsura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for Kṛṣṇa because He has full potency, as confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.32):

> aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti
> paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti
> ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

Kṛṣṇa's body is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], or //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha.// That is, any of the parts of His //ānanda-cinmaya// body can act for any other part. Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire these potencies; He already has them. Thus Kṛṣṇa kicked His little legs, and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have been injured in many ways, but because Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling of the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa,// full transcendental bliss. Thus Kṛṣṇa factually enjoyed.

The nearby children saw that actually Kṛṣṇa had kicked the wheel of the cart and this was how the accident happened. By the arrangement of //yogamāyā,// all the //gopīs// and //gopas// thought that the accident had taken place because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything was done by Kṛṣṇa and enjoyed by Him. Those who enjoy the activities of Kṛṣṇa are also on the platform of //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa;// they are liberated from the material platform. When one develops the practice of hearing //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// he is certainly transcendental to material existence, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]). Unless one is on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the transcendental activities of Kṛṣṇa; or in other words, whoever engages in hearing the transcendental activities of Kṛṣṇa is not on the material platform, but on the transcendental, spiritual platform.
