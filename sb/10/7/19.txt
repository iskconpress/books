**Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the child was being attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished mother Yaśodā put the child down on the ground and began to think of Nārāyaṇa. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brāhmaṇas to counteract this heaviness, and then she engaged in her other household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa, for she could not understand that Kṛṣṇa was the original source of everything.**

Mother Yaśodā did not understand that Kṛṣṇa is the heaviest of all heavy things and that Kṛṣṇa rests within everything (//mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni//). As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]], //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:// Kṛṣṇa is everywhere in His impersonal form, and everything rests upon Him. Nonetheless, //na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ:// Kṛṣṇa is not everywhere. Mother Yaśodā was unable to understand this philosophy because she was dealing with Kṛṣṇa as His real mother by the arrangement of //yogamāyā.// Not understanding the importance of Kṛṣṇa, she could only seek shelter of Nārāyaṇa for Kṛṣṇa's safety and call the //brāhmaṇas// to counteract the situation.
