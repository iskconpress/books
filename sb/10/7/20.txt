Kṛṣṇa's heaviness was unbearable for the child's mother, but when Tṛṇāvartāsura came, he immediately carried the child away. This was another demonstration of Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable energy. When the Tṛṇāvarta demon came, Kṛṣṇa became lighter than the grass so that the demon could carry Him away. This was //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa,// Kṛṣṇa's blissful, transcendental pleasure.
