**When mother Yaśodā saw the whole universe within the mouth of her child, her heart began to throb, and in astonishment she wanted to close her restless eyes.**

===== Purport =====

Because of her pure maternal love, mother Yaśodā thought that this wonderful child playing so many tricks must have had some disease. She did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to close her eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes became restless like those of a deer cub. This was all the arrangement of //yogamāyā.// The relationship between mother Yaśodā and Kṛṣṇa is one of pure maternal love. In that love, mother Yaśodā did not very much appreciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's opulences.

At the beginning of this chapter, two extra verses sometimes appear:

> evaṁ bahūni karmāṇi
> gopānāṁ śaṁ sa-yoṣitām
> nandasya gehe vavṛdhe
> kurvan viṣṇu-janārdanaḥ

"In this way, to chastise and kill the demons, the child Kṛṣṇa demonstrated many activities in the house of Nanda Mahārāja, and the inhabitants of Vraja enjoyed these incidents."

> evaṁ sa vavṛdhe viṣṇur
> nanda-gehe janārdanaḥ
> kurvann aniśam ānandaṁ
> gopālānāṁ sa-yoṣitām

"To increase the transcendental pleasure of the //gopas// and the //gopīs,// Kṛṣṇa, the killer of all demons, was thus raised by His father and mother, Nanda and Yaśodā."

Śrīpāda Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha also adds another verse after the third verse in this chapter:

> vistareṇeha kāruṇyāt
> sarva-pāpa-praṇāśanam
> vaktum arhasi dharma-jña
> dayālus tvam iti prabho

"Parīkṣit Mahārāja then requested Śukadeva Gosvāmī to continue speaking such narrations about the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, so that the King could enjoy from them transcendental bliss."

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Killing of the Demon Tṛṇāvarta."
