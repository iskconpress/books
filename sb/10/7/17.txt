===== Purport =====

//Brāhmaṇas// fully equipped with the brahminical qualifications are always //yogīs// fully powerful in mystic //yoga.// Their words never fail. In every transaction with other members of society, //brāhmaṇas// are certainly dependable. In this age, however, one must take into account that the //brāhmaṇas// are uncertain in their qualifications. Because there are no yajñic //brāhmaṇas,// all //yajñas// are forbidden. The only //yajña// recommended in this age is //saṅkīrtana-yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// (SB 11.5.32). //Yajña// is meant to satisfy Viṣṇu (//yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]//)). Because in this age there are no qualified //brāhmaṇas,// people should perform //yajña// by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ//). Life is meant for //yajña,// and //yajña// is performed by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
