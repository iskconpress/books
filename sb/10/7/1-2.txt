As stated in the //Prema-vivarta://

> kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha haiyā bhoga-vāñchā kare
> nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare

Our material existence is //māyā,// or illusion, in which we desire different varieties of material enjoyment and therefore change to different varieties of bodies (//bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]). //Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ:// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]] as long as we have these temporary bodies, they give us many varieties of tribulation---//ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika// and //ādhidaivika.// This is the root cause of all suffering, but this root cause of suffering can be removed by revival of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All the Vedic literatures presented by Vyāsadeva and other great sages are therefore intended to revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which begins to revive with //śravaṇa-kīrtanam. Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|(SB 1.2.17)]]. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us a chance to hear about Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has different //avatāras,// or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which arouse one's inquisitiveness, but generally such //avatāras// as Matsya, Kūrma and Varāha are not as attractive as Kṛṣṇa. First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about Kṛṣṇa, and this is the root cause of our suffering.

But Parīkṣit Mahārāja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby Kṛṣṇa, which amazed mother Yaśodā and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood, Kṛṣṇa killed Pūtanā, Tṛṇāvarta and Śakaṭāsura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, one after another, kept mother Yaśodā and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment. The process to revive one's Kṛṣṇa consciousness is //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.4.15). The pastimes of Kṛṣṇa can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by hearing from Vaiṣṇavas about the activities of Kṛṣṇa, one becomes attached to Vaiṣṇavas who are interested only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja recommends that one hear about Kṛṣṇa's childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, Kūrma and Varāha. Wanting to hear more and more from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Mahārāja Parīkṣit requested him to continue describing Kṛṣṇa's childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more inquisitiveness.
