===== Purport =====

According to the Sanskrit dictionary //Amara-kośa,// sex life is also called //grāmya-dharma,// material desire, but in spiritual life this //grāmya-dharma,// the material desire for sex, is not very much appreciated. If one has a tinge of attachment for the material enjoyments of eating, sleeping, mating and defending, one is not //niṣkiñcana.// But one really should be //niṣkiñcana.// Therefore, one should be free from the desire to beget a child like Kṛṣṇa by sexual enjoyment. This is indirectly hinted at in this verse.
