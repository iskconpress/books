Vasudeva and Devakī did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devakī obtained Kṛṣṇa as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get Kṛṣṇa as his son, but at least one can get very good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that if human beings do not follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of //varṇa-saṅkara// population, population begotten like cats and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness but simply encouraging artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of //varṇa-saṅkara,// unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in controlled life.

Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for //tapo divyam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]], transcendental austerity. Everyone should be taught to undergo austerity, //tapasya.// Although it may not be possible to undergo //tapasya// like that of Pṛśni and Sutapā, the //śāstra// has given an opportunity for a method of //tapasya// very easy to perform---the //saṅkīrtana// movement. One cannot expect to undergo //tapasya// to get Kṛṣṇa as one's child, yet simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// (//kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya// [SB 12.3.51]), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the contamination of this material world (//mukta-saṅgaḥ//) and goes back home, back to Godhead (//paraṁ vrajet//). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take the real path of happiness as prescribed in the //śāstra//---the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra//---and become perfect in every aspect of material existence.
