===== Purport =====

The word //suvismitā,// meaning "astonished," is significant in this verse. Devakī and her husband, Vasudeva, were assured that their child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead and could not be killed by Kaṁsa, but because of affection, as they thought of Kaṁsa's previous atrocities, they were simultaneously afraid that Kṛṣṇa would be killed. This is why the word //suvismitā// has been used. Similarly, we are also astounded upon thinking of whether this movement will be killed by the //asuras// or will continue to advance without fear.
