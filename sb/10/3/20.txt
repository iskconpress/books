===== Translation =====

**My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds, You assume the white color of Viṣṇu in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You appear blackish.**

===== Purport =====

Vasudeva prayed to the Lord, "You are called //śuklam. Śuklam,// or 'whiteness,' is the symbolic representation of the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahmā is called //rakta,// or red, because Brahmā represents the qualities of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord Śiva because he annihilates the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities." As confirmed in the //Vedas, harir hi nirguṇaḥ sākṣāt:// the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord.

In this verse, the three colors mentioned-//śukla, rakta// and //kṛṣṇa//---are not to be understood literally, in terms of what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// After all, sometimes we see that a duck is white, although it is in //tamo-guṇa,// the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic called //bakāndha-nyāya,// the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vyāsadeva, however, the compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in //tamo-guṇa;// rather, he is in the highest position of //sattva-guṇa,// beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (//śukla-raktas tathā pītaḥ//) are used to designate the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// Lord Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is celebrated as possessing a blackish color, Lord Śiva is whitish, and Lord Brahmā is reddish, but according to Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī in the //Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī-ṭīkā,// this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here.

The real understanding of //śukla, rakta// and //kṛṣṇa// is as follows. The Lord is always transcendental, but for the sake of creation He assumes the color //rakta// as Lord Brahmā. Again, sometimes the Lord becomes angry. As He says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:16:19|(Bg. 16.19)]]:

> tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān
> saṁsāreṣu narādhamān
> kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān
> āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu

"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." To destroy the demons, the Lord becomes angry, and therefore He assumes the form of Lord Śiva. In summary, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always beyond the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception. One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or //mahājanas.// As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|(1.3.28)]], //ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.//
