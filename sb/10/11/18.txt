It is a custom of Vedic culture that whenever there is any auspicious ceremony, one should give valuable cows in charity to the //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore mother Yaśodā requested Kṛṣṇa, "Instead of being enthusiastic in playing, now please come and be enthusiastic in charity." //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat.// As advised in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:5|(Bg. 18.5)]], sacrifice, charity and austerity should never be given up. //Yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām:// even if one is very much advanced in spiritual life, one should not give up these three duties. To observe one's birthday ceremony, one should do something in terms of one of these three items (//yajña, dāna// or //tapaḥ//), or all of them together.
