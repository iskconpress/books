Here is an instruction about the result of studying or discussing the //kṛṣṇa-līlās// that appear in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate 'tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt// [[books:sb:1:1:2|(SB 1.1.2)]]. Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā in Vṛndāvana appeared like ordinary persons of this material world, but they never felt the tribulations of this world, although they sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is a practical example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mahārāja and the //gopas,// we can all be happy simply by discussing the activities of Kṛṣṇa.

Vyāsadeva has given this literature so that everyone may understand one's transcendental position simply by discussing //bhāgavata-kathā.// Even at the present moment, everyone everywhere can be happy and free from material tribulations by following //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// There is no need of austerities and penances, which in this age are very difficult to perform. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore declared, //sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.// By our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are trying to distribute //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// so that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by chanting and hearing about the activities of Kṛṣṇa and be free from all material tribulations.
