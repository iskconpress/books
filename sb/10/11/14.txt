**Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, being attached to Their play, were playing with the other boys although it was very late. Therefore mother Yaśodā called Them back for lunch. Because of her ecstatic love and affection for Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, milk flowed from her breasts.**

The word //ajohavīt// means "calling them again and again." "Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma," she called, "please come back. You are late for Your lunch. You have played sufficiently. Come back."
