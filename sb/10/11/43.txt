**Thereafter, Śrī Kṛṣṇa caught the demon by the hind legs and tail, twirled the demon's whole body very strongly until the demon was dead, and threw him into the top of a kapittha tree, which then fell down, along with the body of the demon, who had assumed a great form.**

===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa killed the demon in such a way as to get the //kapittha// fruits to fall so that He and Balarāma and the other boys could take advantage of the opportunity to eat them. The //kapittha// is sometimes called //kṣatbelphala.// The pulp of this fruit is very palatable. It is sweet and sour, and everyone likes it.
