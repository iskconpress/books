===== Purport =====

This kind of playing and stealing among boys still exists even in the material world because this kind of sporting pleasure is present in the spiritual world, from which this idea of enjoyment emanates. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]] (//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.2). This same enjoyment is displayed by Kṛṣṇa and His associates in the spiritual world, but there the enjoyment is eternal, whereas here, on the material platform, it is temporary; there the enjoyment is //brahman,// whereas here the enjoyment is //jaḍa.// The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to train one how to transfer oneself from the //jaḍa// to the Brahman, because human life is meant for this purpose. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā// (//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.1). Kṛṣṇa comes down to teach us how we can enjoy with Him on the spiritual platform, in the spiritual world. Not only does He come, but He personally displays His pastimes in Vṛndāvana and attracts people to spiritual enjoyment.
