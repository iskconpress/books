As recommended by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, //tasmāt kenāpy upāyena manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet// (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.4) [[books:sb:7:1:32|[SB 7.1.32]]]. Somehow or other, whether one thinks of Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary human child, as the source of the Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Paramātmā, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should concentrate one's full attention upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is also the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the easiest way of directly approaching Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate 'tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt// [[books:sb:1:1:2|(SB 1.1.2)]]. Diverting even a little of one's attention toward Kṛṣṇa and activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest perfection of life. This is the purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. //Lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām// [[books:sb:1:7:6|(SB 1.7.6)]]. The secret of success is unknown to people in general, and therefore Śrīla Vyāsadeva, being compassionate toward the poor souls in this material world, especially in this age of Kali, has given us the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ purāṇam amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyam// (SB 12.13.18). For Vaiṣṇavas who are somewhat advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the Lord, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we have to change this body (//tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]). If we do not care about //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// we do not know what the next body will be. But if one adheres to these two books---//Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam//---one is sure to obtain the association of Kṛṣṇa in the next life (//tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]). Therefore, distribution of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// all over the world is a great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists and //yogīs// (//yoginām api sarveṣām// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]), as well as for people in general. //Janma-lābhaḥ paraḥ puṁsām ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:6|(SB 2.1.6)]]: if we can somehow or other remember Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa, at the end of life, our life will be successful.
