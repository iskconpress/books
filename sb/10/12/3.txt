In this verse the words //kṛṣṇa-vatsair asaṅkhyātaiḥ// are significant. The word //asaṅkhyāta// means "unlimited." Kṛṣṇa's calves were unlimited. We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and so on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for us to count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers are indicated here by the word //asaṅkhyātaiḥ.// Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, His potency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is unlimited. Therefore He is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as Parabrahman. The word //brahman// means "unlimited," and Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Unlimited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements of this verse to be mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable. Kṛṣṇa can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an unlimited measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we study Kṛṣṇa's potency with our limited knowledge, that potency will never be possible to understand. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Our senses cannot perceive how He could keep an unlimited number of calves and cows and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta://

> evaṁ prabhoḥ priyānāṁ ca
> dhāmnaś ca samayasya ca
> avicintya-prabhāvatvād
> atra kiñcin na durghaṭam

Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, in the //Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta,// states that since everything about Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, nothing is impossible for Him. It is in this sense that we have to understand this verse.
