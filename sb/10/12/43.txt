===== Translation =====

**O my lord, my spiritual master, although we are the lowest of kṣatriyas, we are glorified and benefited because we have the opportunity of always hearing from you the nectar of the pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to hear such activities unless one is very, very fortunate. Parīkṣit Mahārāja placed himself as //kṣatra-bandhavaḥ,// which means "the lowest of the //kṣatriyas.//" The qualities of the //kṣatriya// are described in //Bhagavad-gītā,// and although the general quality of the //kṣatriya// is //īśvara-bhāva,// the tendency to rule, a //kṣatriya// is not supposed to rule over a //brāhmaṇa.// Thus Mahārāja Parīkṣit regretted that he had wanted to rule over the //brāhmaṇas// and had therefore been cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the //kṣatriyas. Dānam īśvara-bhāvaś ca kṣātraṁ karma svabhāvajam// [[books:bg:18:43|(Bg. 18.43)]]. There was no doubt that Mahārāja Parīkṣit had the good qualities of a //kṣatriya,// but as a devotee he presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the //kṣatriyas,// remembering his act of wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a //brāhmaṇa.// A student and disciple has the right to ask the //guru// about any confidential service, and it is the duty of the //guru// to explain these confidential matters to his disciple.
