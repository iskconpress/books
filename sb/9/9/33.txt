===== Purport =====

This is an example of destiny. King Saudāsa was condemned by the curse of Vasiṣṭha, and therefore even though he was well qualified he could not restrain himself from becoming a tigerlike Rākṣasa, for this was his destiny. //Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham// [[books:sb:1:5:18|(SB 1.5.18)]]. As one is put into distress by destiny, destiny can also put one in a happy situation. Destiny is extremely strong, but one can change destiny if one comes to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// (Bs. 5.54).
