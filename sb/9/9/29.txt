**Here is a learned, highly qualified brāhmaṇa, engaged in performing austerity and eagerly desiring to worship the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul who lives within the core of the heart in all living entities.**

===== Purport =====

The wife of the //brāhmaṇa// did not regard her husband as a superficial //brāhmaṇa// who was called a //brāhmaṇa// merely because he was born of a //brāhmaṇa// family. Rather, this //brāhmaṇa// was actually qualified with the brahminical symptoms. //Yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|(SB 7.11.35)]]. The symptoms of a //brāhmaṇa// are stated in the //śāstra://

> śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ
> kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca
> jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ
> brahma-karma svabhāvajam

"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the //brāhmaṇas// work." [[books:bg:18:42|(Bg. 18.42)]] Not only must a //brāhmaṇa// be qualified, but he must also engage in actual brahminical activities. Simply to be qualified is not enough; one must engage in a //brāhmaṇa's// duties. The duty of a //brāhmaṇa// is to know the //paraṁ brahma,// Kṛṣṇa (//paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]). Because this //brāhmaṇa// was actually qualified and was also engaged in brahminical activities (//brahma-karma// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]), killing him would be a greatly sinful act, and the //brāhmaṇa's// wife requested that he not be killed.
