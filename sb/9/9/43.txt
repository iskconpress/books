**Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me than the brahminical culture and the brāhmaṇas, who are worshiped by my family. What then is to be said of my kingdom, land, wife, children and opulence? Nothing is dearer to me than the brāhmaṇas.**

===== Purport =====

Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga, being in favor of the brahminical culture, wanted to utilize one moment's time by fully surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is worshiped with this prayer:

> namo brāhmaṇya-devāya
> go brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

"I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, who is the well-wisher of the cows and the //brāhmaṇas// as well as the living entities in general. I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses." A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is very much attached to brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Kṛṣṇa is and what He wants is a real //brāhmaṇa. Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Kṛṣṇa conscious persons, or devotees of Kṛṣṇa, are exalted //brāhmaṇas.// Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja regarded the devotees of Kṛṣṇa as the real //brāhmaṇas// and the real light for human society. One who desires to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Kṛṣṇa (//kṛṣṇāya govindāya//). Then his life will be successful.
