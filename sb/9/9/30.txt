===== Translation =====

**My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As a son never deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brāhmaṇa who should be protected by the king, and never killed. How does he deserve to be killed by a rājarṣi like you?**

===== Purport =====

The word //rājarṣi// refers to a king who behaves like a //ṛṣi,// or sage. Such a king is also called //naradeva// because he is considered a representative of the Supreme Lord. Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a //brāhmaṇa.// Generally, a //brāhmaṇa,// woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punishable. Thus the wife of the //brāhmaṇa// requested the King to refrain from this sinful act.
