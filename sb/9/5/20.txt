===== Purport =====

It is said, //vaiṣṇavera kriyā mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:// [[books:cc:madhya:23:39|[Cc. Madhya 23.39]]] even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaiṣṇava. Therefore, because Durvāsā Muni was a great mystic //yogī,// he first mistook Mahārāja Ambarīṣa for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaiṣṇava. When Durvāsā Muni was persecuted by the Sudarśana //cakra,// however, his intelligence developed. Therefore the word //ātma-medhasā// is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vaiṣṇava the King was. When Durvāsā Muni was chased by the Sudarśana //cakra,// he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarśana //cakra.// Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaiṣṇava by personal experience. Durvāsā Muni was certainly a great //yogī// and a very learned //brāhmaṇa,// but despite his being a real //yogī// he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore it is said, //vaiṣṇavera kriyā mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:// even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaiṣṇava. There is always a possibility for so-called //jñānīs// and //yogīs// to be mistaken when studying the character of a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.
