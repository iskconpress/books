**O Sudarśana wheel, you are religion, you are truth, you are encouraging statements, you are sacrifice, and you are the enjoyer of the fruits of sacrifice. You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and you are the supreme transcendental prowess in the hands of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You are the original vision of the Lord, and therefore you are known as Sudarśana. Everything has been created by your activities, and therefore you are all-pervading.**

===== Purport =====

The word //sudarśana// means "auspicious vision." From Vedic instructions we understand that this material world is created by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//sa aikṣata, sa asṛjata//). The Supreme Personality of Godhead glanced over the //mahat-tattva,// or the total material energy, and when it was agitated, everything came into existence. Western philosophers sometimes think that the original cause of creation was a chunk that exploded. If one thinks of this chunk as the total material energy, the //mahat-tattva,// one can understand that the chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and thus the Lord's glance is the original cause of material creation.
