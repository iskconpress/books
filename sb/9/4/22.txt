{{description>In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvatī, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa performed great sacrifices like the aśvamedha-yajña and thus satisfied the master of all yajñas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

===== Translation =====

**In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvatī, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa performed great sacrifices like the aśvamedha-yajña and thus satisfied the master of all yajñas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of dakṣiṇā to the brāhmaṇas, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasiṣṭha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.**

===== Purport =====

When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the //Vedas,// one needs expert //brāhmaṇas// known as //yājñika-brāhmaṇas.// In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in //śāstra// is //saṅkīrtana-yajña// (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]). Instead of spending money unnecessarily on performing //yajñas// impossible to perform in this age of Kali because of the scarcity of //yājñika-brāhmaṇas,// one who is intelligent performs //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// Without properly performed //yajñas// to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be scarcity of rain (//yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]). Therefore the performance of //yajña// is essential. Without //yajña// there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will be famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types of //yajñas,// such as the //aśvamedha-yajña,// to maintain the production of food grains. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// Without food grains, both men and animals will starve. Therefore //yajña// is necessary for the state to perform because by //yajña// the people in general will be fed sumptuously. The //brāhmaṇas// and //yājñika// priests should be sufficiently paid for their expert service. This payment is called //dakṣiṇā.// Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, as the head of the state, performed all these //yajñas// through great personalities like Vasiṣṭha, Gautama and Asita. Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (//sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]). The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere.
