===== Purport =====

A devotee cannot be defeated by a so-called mystic //yogī.// This will be proved by the failure of Durvāsā Muni's endeavor to chastise Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]]. One who is not a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord has no good qualifications, however great a mystic, philosopher or fruitive worker he may be. Only a devotee emerges victorious in all circumstances, as will be shown in this incident involving the rivalry between Durvāsā and Mahārāja Ambarīṣa.
