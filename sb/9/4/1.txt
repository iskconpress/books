===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: The son of Nabhaga named Nābhāga lived for a long time at the place of his spiritual master. Therefore, his brothers thought that he was not going to become a gṛhastha and would not return. Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of their father among themselves. When Nābhāga returned from the place of his spiritual master, they gave him their father as his share.**

===== Purport =====

There are two kinds of //brahmacārīs.// One may return home, marry and become a householder, whereas the other, known as //bṛhad-vrata,// takes a vow to remain a //brahmacārī// perpetually. The //bṛhad-vrata brahmacārī// does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly takes //sannyāsa.// Because Nābhāga did not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers thought that he had taken //bṛhadvrata-brahmacarya.// Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when he returned they gave him their father as his share.
