===== Purport =====

In this verse, the word //sama-darśanāḥ// is significant. The pure devotee is actually equal toward everyone, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]]: //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati/ samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (//paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]). A pure devotee is actually learned because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically liberated (//brahma-bhūtaḥ//). He can therefore see everyone on the spiritual platform. He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all living entities. He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and that what is distress to him is distressing for others. Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone. As Prahlāda Mahārāja said:

> śoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyārtha-
> māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān
> [[books:sb:7:9:43|(SB 7.9.43)]]

People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee's chief concern, therefore, is to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
