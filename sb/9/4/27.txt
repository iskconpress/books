===== Purport =====

//Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.// Material possessions can be accepted as far as they can be used in devotional service. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. //Ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ prātikūlyasya varjanam.// In preaching, many things considered material are needed. A devotee should not have any attachment for such material involvements as house, wife, children, friends and cars. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, for example, had all such things, but he was not attached to them. This is the effect of //bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// (SB 11.2.42). One who is advanced in devotional service has no attachment for material things for sense enjoyment, but for preaching, to spread the glories of the Lord, he accepts such things without attachment. //Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.// Everything can be used to the extent that it can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.
