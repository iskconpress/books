{{description>Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sāṅkhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience. Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this philosophy. In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?}}

===== Translation =====

**Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sāṅkhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience. Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this philosophy. In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?**

===== Purport =====

One who is promoted to the transcendental position (//brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]]) is always jubilant (//prasannātmā//). He is unaffected by the false distinctions between good and bad in the material world. Therefore, such an exalted person is //samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu;// that is to say, he is equal toward everyone, not distinguishing between friend and enemy. Because he is on the absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called //parātma-bhūta// or //brahma-bhūta.// Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at the sons of Sagara Mahārāja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of their own bodies.
