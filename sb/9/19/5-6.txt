===== Translation =====

**When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she desired to accept him as her husband. When she did so, many other she-goats also desired him as their husband because he had a very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert in discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.**

===== Purport =====

Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Although one becomes a //gṛhastha,// or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart's content, one is never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for self-realization.

> tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ
> śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam
> [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]

Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (dehino 'smin yathā dehe//// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]). A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body. However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily concept of life.
