===== Purport =====

Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī said, //viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate:// when one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, for him the entire world appears happy, and he has nothing for which to hanker. On the //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]] stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is no lamentation and no material hankering (//na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]). As long as one lives in the material world, actions and reactions will continue, but when one is unaffected by such material actions and reactions, he is to be considered free from the danger of being victimized by material desires. The symptoms of those who are satiated with lusty desires are described in this verse. As explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, when one is not envious even of his enemy, does not expect honor from anyone, but instead desires all well-being even for his enemy, he is understood to be a //paramahaṁsa,// one who has fully subdued the lusty desires for sense gratification.
