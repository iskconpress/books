===== Translation =====

**Because King Yayāti completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, he was freed from all contamination of the material modes of nature. Because of his self-realization, he was able to fix his mind upon the Transcendence [Parabrahman, Vāsudeva], and thus he ultimately achieved the position of an associate of the Lord.**

===== Purport =====

The word //vidhuta,// meaning "cleansed," is very significant. Everyone in this material world is contaminated (//kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]). Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by //sattva-guṇa,// by //rajo-guṇa// or by //tamo-guṇa.// Even if one becomes a qualified //brāhmaṇa// in the mode of goodness (//sattva-guṇa//), he is still materially contaminated. One must come to the platform of //śuddha-sattva,// transcending the //sattva-guṇa.// Then one is //vidhuta-triliṅga,// cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature. This is possible by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:17|(1.2.17)]]:

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt-satām

"Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted." A person trying to be perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious by hearing the words of Kṛṣṇa from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or //Bhagavad-gītā// certainly has all the dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]] the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Mahārāja Yayāti was, one's original position as an associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called //svarūpa-siddhi,// or personal perfection.
