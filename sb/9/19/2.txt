===== Purport =====

Persons who live in the village or town are called //grāma-nivāsī,// and those who live in the forest are called //vana-vāsī// or //vānaprastha.// The //vānaprasthas,// who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well (//hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpam//). If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to //vana,// the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a //vānaprastha,// he should accept //sannyāsa. Vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]].// Sannyāsa// means accepting unalloyed engagement in the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life-//brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely //vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.//
