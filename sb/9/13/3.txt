===== Purport =====

Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, //śarīraṁ kṣaṇa-vidhvāṁsi kalpānta-sthāyino guṇāḥ:// "The duration of one's life in the material world may end at any moment, but if within this life one does something worthy, that qualification is depicted in history eternally." Here is a great personality, Mahārāja Nimi, who knew this fact. In the human form of life one should perform activities in such a way that at the end he goes back home, back to Godhead. This is self-realization.
