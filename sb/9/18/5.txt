===== Translation =====

**Mahārāja Parīkṣit said: Śukrācārya was a very powerful brāhmaṇa, and Mahārāja Yayāti was a kṣatriya. Therefore I am curious to know how there occurred this pratiloma marriage between a kṣatriya and a brāhmaṇa.**

===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic system, marriages between //kṣatriyas// and //kṣatriyas// or between //brāhmaṇas// and //brāhmaṇas// are the general custom. If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these marriages are of two types, namely //anuloma// and //pratiloma. Anuloma,// marriage between a //brāhmaṇa// and the daughter of a //kṣatriya,// is permissible, but //pratiloma,// marriage between a //kṣatriya// and the daughter of a //brāhmaṇa,// is not generally allowed. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit was curious about how Śukrācārya, a powerful //brāhmaṇa,// could accept the principle of //pratiloma.// Mahārāja Parīkṣit was eager to know the cause for this uncommon marriage.
