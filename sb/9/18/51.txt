**Although Mahārāja Yayāti was the king of the entire world and he engaged his mind and five senses in enjoying material possessions for one thousand years, he was unable to be satisfied.**

===== Purport =====

The //kad-indriya,// or unpurified senses, can be purified if one engages the senses and the mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. One must be freed from all designations. When one identifies himself with the material world, his senses are impure. But when one achieves spiritual realization and identifies himself as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately. Engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called //bhakti. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.// One may enjoy the senses for many thousands of years, but unless one purifies the senses, one cannot be happy.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "King Yayāti Regains His Youth."
