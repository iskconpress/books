===== Purport =====

Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities. //Kṣatriyas// are generally endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one looses the chance for human perfection. Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// This hearing is described as //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was involved in politics, but because at the end of his life he heard //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he attained perfection very easily. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore suggested:

> sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir
> ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām
> (SB 10.14.3)

Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.
