===== Purport =====

When a //brāhmaṇa// adopts the profession of a //kapota,// or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the field. This is called //uñcha-vṛtti.// A //brāhmaṇa// who takes to this //uñcha-vṛtti// profession is called first class because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a //brāhmaṇa// or //sannyāsī,// one does better if he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance. Śukrācārya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter's complaint he had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the profession of priesthood. In his heart, Śukrācārya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.
