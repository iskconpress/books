**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, at the beginning of Tretā-yuga, King Purūravā inaugurated a karma-kāṇḍa sacrifice. Thus Purūravā, who considered the yajñic fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he desired.**

===== Purport =====

In Satya-yuga, Lord Nārāyaṇa was worshiped by meditation (//kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇum//). Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, and achieved every success by this process of meditation. In the next //yuga,// Tretā-yuga, the performance of //yajña// began (//tretāyāṁ yajato mukhaiḥ//). Therefore this verse says, //trayī tretā-mukhe.// Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that in Tretā-yuga, beginning in the Svāyambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "King Purūravā Enchanted by Urvaśī."
