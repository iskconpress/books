{{description>When the process of fruitive yajña became manifest within his heart, King Purūravā went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthālī. There he saw that from the womb of a śamī tree, an aśvattha tree had grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two araṇis. Desiring to go to the planet where Urvaśī resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower araṇi as Urvaśī, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.}}

===== Translation =====

**When the process of fruitive yajña became manifest within his heart, King Purūravā went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthālī. There he saw that from the womb of a śamī tree, an aśvattha tree had grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two araṇis. Desiring to go to the planet where Urvaśī resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower araṇi as Urvaśī, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.**

===== Purport =====

The Vedic fire for performing //yajña// was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the //araṇis,// or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of //yajña.// If successful, a //yajña// will fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Purūravā took advantage of the process of //yajña// to fulfill his lusty desires. He thought of the lower //araṇi// as Urvaśī, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic //mantra// quoted herein by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura is //śamī-garbhād agniṁ mantha.// A similar //mantra// is //urvaśyām urasi purūravāḥ.// Purūravā wanted to have children continuously by the womb of Urvaśī. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvaśī and thereby get a son. In other words, he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing //yajña// he thought of Urvaśī, instead of thinking of the master of //yajña,// Yajñeśvara, Lord Viṣṇu.
