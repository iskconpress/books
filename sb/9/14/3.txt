===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//candramā manaso jātaḥ//). But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, //dṛgbhya ānandāśrubhya ata evāmṛtamayaḥ:// "Here the word //dṛgbhyaḥ// means 'from tears of jubilation.' Therefore the moon-god is called //amṛtamayaḥ,// 'full of soothing rays.' " In the Fourth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:4:1:15|(4.1.15)]] we find this verse:

> atreḥ patny anasūyā trīñ
> jajñe suyaśasaḥ sutān
> dattaṁ durvāsasaṁ somam
> ātmeśa-brahma-sambhavān

This verse describes that Anasūyā, the wife of Atri Ṛṣi, bore three sons---Soma, Durvāsā and Dattātreya. It is said that at the time of conception Anasūyā was impregnated by the tears of Atri.
