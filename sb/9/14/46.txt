===== Translation =====

**From Purūravā's rubbing of the araṇis came a fire. By such a fire one can achieve all success in material enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are invoked with the combined letters a-u-m. Thus the fire was considered the son of King Purūravā.**

===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (//śukra//), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (//sāvitra//), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (//yajña//). Thus when Mahārāja Purūravā generated the fire by rubbing the //araṇis,// the fire became his son. Either by semen, by initiation or by //yajña// one may get a son. The Vedic //mantra oṁkāra,// or //praṇava,// consisting of the letters //a-u-m,// can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the words //nirmanthanāj jātaḥ// indicate that by the rubbing of the //araṇis// a son was born.
