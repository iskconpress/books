**King Purūravā then left Agnisthālī in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon Urvaśī. In the course of his meditation, the Tretā millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing yajña to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.**

===== Purport =====

It is said, //tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ:// in Tretā-yuga, if one performed //yajñas,// he would get the results of those //yajñas.// By performing //viṣṇu-yajña// specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, //yajña// is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Purūravā was meditating upon Urvaśī, the Tretā-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic //yajñas// were revealed in his heart. But Purūravā was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses. //Yajñas// for enjoyment of the senses are called //karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas.// Therefore, he decided to perform //karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas// to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, //karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas// are meant for sensuous persons, whereas //yajña// should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// is recommended. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. Only those who are very intelligent take to //saṅkīrtana-yajña// to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform //karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas.//
