===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram:// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]] any //loka,// or planet, to which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the performance of sacrifice. The purpose of //yajña// is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, as we have explained many times, the //yajña// of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is the only sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material or spiritual. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:14|(Bg. 3.14)]] also says, //yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ:// by offering sacrifices to Lord Viṣṇu, one can have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything (//sarva-kāma-dughā mahī//). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, //sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|(SB 1.10.4)]]. Everything is possible by performing //yajña.// Therefore although Purūravā desired something material, he factually performed //yajña// to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is //adhokṣaja,// beyond the perception of Purūravā and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of //yajña// must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity. //Yajñas// can be performed in human society only when society is divided by //varṇāśrama-dharma// into four //varṇas// and four //āśramas.// Without such a regulative process, no one can perform //yajñas,// and without the performance of //yajñas,// no material plans can make human society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform //yajñas.// In this age of Kali, the //yajña// recommended is //saṅkīrtana,// the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.
