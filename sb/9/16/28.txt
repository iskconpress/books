===== Purport =====

Now, having narrated the history of Lord Paraśurāma, Śukadeva Gosvāmī begins the history of Viśvāmitra. From the history of Paraśurāma we can understand that although Paraśurāma belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a //kṣatriya.// Later, after finishing his work as a //kṣatriya,// he again became a //brāhmaṇa// and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that although Viśvāmitra was born in a //kṣatriya// family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a //brāhmaṇa.// These histories confirm the statements in //śāstra// that a //brāhmaṇa// may become a //kṣatriya,// a //kṣatriya// may become a //brāhmaṇa// or //vaiśya,// and a //vaiśya// may become a //brāhmaṇa,// by achieving the required qualities. One's status does not depend upon birth. As confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|(7.11.35)]] by Nārada:

> yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam
> yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet

"If one shows the symptoms of being a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification." To know who is a //brāhmaṇa// and who is a //kṣatriya,// one must consider a man's quality and work. If all the unqualified //śūdras// become so-called //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas,// social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish.
