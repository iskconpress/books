===== Purport =====

In Vedic literature there are names like //mleccha// and //yavana.// The //mlecchas// are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic principles. In former days, the //mlecchas// were fewer, and Viśvāmitra Muni cursed his sons to become //mlecchas.// But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for people are automatically //mlecchas.// This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the entire population will consist of //mlecchas// because no one will follow the Vedic principles. At that time the incarnation Kalki will appear. //Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi kara-bālam.// He will kill all the //mlecchas// indiscriminately with his sword.
