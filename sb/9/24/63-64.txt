===== Purport =====

The words //nṛlokaṁ ramayām āsa mūrtyā sarvāṅga-ramyayā// are significant. Kṛṣṇa is the original form. Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word //mūrtyā.// The word //mūrti// means "form." Kṛṣṇa, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of His transcendental body (//yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi// [Bs. 5.40]). The Lord is //narākṛti,// exactly resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word //sarvāṅga-ramyayā// informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling face, every part of His body---His hands, His legs, His chest---is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.
