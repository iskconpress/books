===== Purport =====

The Lord's activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons (//paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]) take place side by side. Kṛṣṇa actually appears for the deliverance of the //sādhus,// or //bhaktas,// but by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Kṛṣṇa is liberated. Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the demons and the devotees.
