===== Translation =====

**Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.**

===== Purport =====

When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they are no longer interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve freedom from the material world. For sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of //janma-mṛtyu jarā-vyādhi [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]//---birth, death, old age and disease---but the devotee, simply by hearing the message of //Bhagavad-gītā// and further relishing the narrations of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// becomes so pure that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities. At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are being attracted by Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement. But they cannot possibly check this movement or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions. Here the words //śrotrāñjalir upaspṛśya// indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.1.11] Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the devotees are freed from such activities. The devotees are situated in liberation (//brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]), and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.
