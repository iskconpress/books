===== Translation =====

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as līlā-puruṣottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and went to Vṛndāvana to expand His loving relationship with His confidential devotees. In Vṛndāvana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvārakā, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]], //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// by all the //Vedas,// it is Kṛṣṇa who is to be known. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the //Vedas// and established the principles of //gṛhastha// life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Kṛṣṇa (//vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ//). To advance in human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in His householder life. The real purpose of Kṛṣṇa's appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in Vṛndāvana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the //gopīs// and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:8|(Bg. 4.8)]], //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām:// the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be //puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam//---the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person. Here also we find the words //utpādya teṣu puruṣaḥ.// Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is //puruṣa,// a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He //puruṣa,// a person, but He is the //līlā-puruṣottama,// the best of all persons.
