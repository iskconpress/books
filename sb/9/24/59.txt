**Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:8|(Bg. 4.8)]], //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.// The //sādhus,// the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the conditioned souls may be released from the bondage of birth and death. But the //asuras,// the demons, impede the advancement of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and therefore Kṛṣṇa arranges occasional fights between different //asuras// who are very much interested in increasing their military power. The duty of the government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to see that the people of the state advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For this purpose, Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]], //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:// "According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me." There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide //brāhmaṇas,// and they should be given all protection. //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// Kṛṣṇa is very fond of //brāhmaṇas// and cows, The //brāhmaṇas// promulgate the cause of advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness. The //kṣatriyas// and the government should be advised by the //brāhmaṇas.// Next, the //vaiśyas// should produce enough foodstuffs, and the //śūdras,// who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas//). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of Kṛṣṇa's descent on the surface of the earth (//paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām//).

Everyone must understand Kṛṣṇa's activities (//janma karma ca me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]). If one understands the purpose of Kṛṣṇa's coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This liberation is the purpose of the creation and Kṛṣṇa's descent upon the surface of the earth. Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Kṛṣṇa's devotees want to teach Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and Kṛṣṇa conscious advancement. Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization. Such endeavors are //jagato'hitaḥ;// that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general. //Kṣayāya:// such activities lead to annihilation. One who understands the purpose of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and seriously take part in it. One should not endeavor for //ugra-karma,// or unnecessary work for sense gratification. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti// [[books:sb:5:5:4|(SB 5.5.4)]]. Simply for sense gratification, people make plans for material happiness. //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|(SB 7.9.43)]]. They do this because they are all //vimūḍhas,// rascals. For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy, not understanding the importance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple devotees of brainwashing. Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, but Kṛṣṇa will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.
