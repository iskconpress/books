===== Translation =====

**Thereafter, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa created a misunderstanding between family members just to diminish the burden of the world. Simply by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and declared victory for Arjuna. Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.**

===== Purport =====

//Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]].// The mission of Lord Kṛṣṇa was performed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, for by the Lord's mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord's glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and enabled them to attain //sārūpya.// Finally, Lord Kṛṣṇa instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode. The Lord's instructions in the form of //Bhagavad-gītā// are full of //jñāna// and //vairāgya,// knowledge and renunciation. In the human form of life, one must learn these two things---how to become detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life. This is the Lord's mission (//paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām//). After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Vṛndāvana.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead"
