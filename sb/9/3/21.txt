===== Purport =====

It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father's family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas// even today; only the //śūdras// are degraded in this matter. For a woman of the //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Śaryāti, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni's transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.
