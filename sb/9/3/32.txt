===== Purport =====

During Lord Brahmā's day, fourteen Manus or one thousand //mahā-yugas// pass away. Brahmā informed King Kakudmī that twenty-seven //mahā-yugas,// each consisting of the four periods Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, had already passed. All the kings and other great personalities born in those //yugas// had now departed from memory into obscurity. This is the way of time as it moves through past, present and future.
