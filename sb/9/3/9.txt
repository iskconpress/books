===== Purport =====

The King, after hearing the statement of his daughter, certainly told the great sage Cyavana Muni everything about how his daughter had ignorantly committed such an offense. The //muni,// however, inquired from the King whether the daughter was married. In this way, the King, understanding the purpose of the great sage Cyavana Muni (//tad-abhiprāyam ājñāya//), immediately gave the //muni// his daughter in charity and escaped the danger of being cursed. Thus with the permission of the great sage the King returned home.
