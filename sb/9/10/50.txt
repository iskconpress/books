===== Purport =====

People are very fond of the pattern of Rāma-rājya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party called Rāma-rājya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Rāma. It is sometimes said that people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord Rāmacandra and His citizens. Lord Rāmacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord Rāmacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children. As indicated here by the words //sva-dharma-niratā varṇāśrama-guṇān-vitāḥ,// the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of //varṇa// and //āśrama,// which arranges society in the //varṇa// divisions of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra// and the //āśrama// divisions of //brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// This is actual human civilization. People must be trained according to the different //varṇāśrama// occupational duties. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]], //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:// the four //varṇas// must be established according to varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that it must institute this //varṇāśrama// system. The purpose of //varṇāśrama// is to enable people to become God conscious. //Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. The entire //varṇāśrama// scheme is intended to enable people to become Vaiṣṇavas. //Viṣṇur asya devatā.// When people worship Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaiṣṇavas. Thus people should be trained to become Vaiṣṇavas through the system of //varṇa// and //āśrama,// as they were during the reign of Lord Rāmacandra, when everyone was fully trained to follow the //varṇāśrama// principles.

Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs.// This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (//varṇāśrama-guṇān-vitāḥ//). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a //rājarṣi,// the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the //varṇāśrama// system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Rāmacandra. If people follow this example, there will be good government all over the world.
