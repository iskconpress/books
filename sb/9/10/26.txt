===== Purport =====

Rāvaṇa's wife Mandodarī and the other wives knew very well how cruel a person Rāvaṇa was. The very word "Rāvaṇa" means "one who causes crying for others." Rāvaṇa continuously caused trouble for others, but when his sinful activities culminated in giving trouble to Sītādevī, he was killed by Lord Rāmacandra.
