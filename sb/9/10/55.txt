===== Translation =====

**Mother Sītā was very submissive, faithful, shy and chaste, always understanding the attitude of her husband. Thus by her character and her love and service she completely attracted the mind of the Lord.**

===== Purport =====

As Lord Rāmacandra is the ideal husband (//eka-patnī-vrata//), mother Sītā is the ideal wife. Such a combination makes family life very happy. //Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ:// whatever example a great man sets, common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the //brāhmaṇas,// the teachers, would set forth the examples we receive from Vedic literature, the entire world would be heaven; indeed, there would no longer be hellish conditions within this material world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Rāmacandra."
