===== Purport =====

Lord Rāmacandra and His brothers, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, are all //viṣṇu-tattva,// not //jīva-tattva.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into many, many forms. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Although they are one and the same, //viṣṇu-tattva// has many forms and incarnations. As confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.39), //rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan.// The Lord is situated in many forms, such as Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, and these forms may exist in any part of His creation. All these forms exist permanently, eternally, as individual Personalities of Godhead, and they resemble many candles, all equally powerful. Lord Rāmacandra, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, who, being //viṣṇu-tattva,// are all equally powerful, became the sons of Mahārāja Daśaratha in response to prayers by the demigods.
