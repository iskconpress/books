===== Purport =====

Among the four //yugas//-Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali-the Kali-yuga is the worst, but if the process of //varṇāśrama-dharma// is introduced, even in this age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be invoked. The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is meant for this purpose.

> kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
> asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ
> kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet

"My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom." (SB 12.3.51) If people take to this //saṅkīrtana// movement of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma, they will certainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people of this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age. Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement; one need only chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// observe the rules and regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// with devotion and faith he will certainly be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Paraṁ //vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.// This is the blessing of Lord Rāmacandra, who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.
