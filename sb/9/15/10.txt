===== Translation =====

**When the great sage Ṛcīka returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife, Satyavatī, "You have done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce kṣatriya, able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science."**

===== Purport =====

A //brāhmaṇa// is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving. A //kṣatriya,// however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// (18.42-43). Because Satyavatī, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she would give birth to a son imbued with the //kṣatriya// spirit. This was undesirable. The son of a //brāhmaṇa// is generally expected to become a //brāhmaṇa,// but if such a son becomes fierce like a //kṣatriya,// he is designated according to the description of the four //varṇas// in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]). If the son of a //brāhmaṇa// does not become like a //brāhmaṇa,// he may be called a //kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing society is not a person's birth but his qualities and actions.
