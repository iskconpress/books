Different personalities become beautiful by possessing different qualities. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says that the cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful when he becomes a learned scholar. In the same way, //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras// become beautiful by their qualities. //Brāhmaṇas// are beautiful when they are forgiving, //kṣatriyas// when they are heroic and never retreat from fighting, //vaiśyas// when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and //śūdras// when they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters. Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities. And the special quality of the //brāhmaṇa,// as described here, is forgiveness.
