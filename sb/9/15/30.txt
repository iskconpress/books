"One chariot, one elephant, five infantry soldiers and three horses are called a //patti// by those who are learned in the science. The wise also know that a //senāmukha// is three times what a //patti// is. Three //senāmukhas// are known as one //gulma,// three //gulmas// are called a //gaṇa,// and three //gaṇas// are called a //vāhinī.// Three //vāhinīs// have been referred to by the learned as a //pṛtanā,// three //pṛtanās// equal one //camū,// and three //camūs// equal one //anīkinī.// The wise refer to ten //anīkinīs// as one //akṣauhiṇī.// The chariots of an //akṣauhiṇī// have been calculated at 21,870 by those who know the science of such calculations, O best of the twice-born, and the number of elephants is the same. The number of infantry soldiers is 109,350, and the number of horses is 65,610. This is called an //akṣauhiṇī.//"
