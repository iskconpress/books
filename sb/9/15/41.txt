===== Purport =====

One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed from all sins (//ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]). From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, even the most sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Paraśurāma to worship the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be released from sinful reactions.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Paraśurāma, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation."
