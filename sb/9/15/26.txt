===== Purport =====

The word //havirdhānīm// is significant in this verse. //Havirdhānīm// refers to a cow required for supplying //havis,// or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be trained to perform //yajñas.// As we are informed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]], //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:// if we do not perform //yajña,// we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A human being should be trained to perform //yajña. Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If //yajñas// are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life. //Yajña,// therefore, is essential. For performing //yajña,// clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer. So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of //prakṛti,// nature (//prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]). Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (//ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate//). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. //Yajñe sukhena bhavantu.//
