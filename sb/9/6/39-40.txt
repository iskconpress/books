This is the beginning of the story of Saubhari Ṛṣi. According to Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Māndhātā was the king of Mathurā, and Saubhari Ṛṣi was engaged in austerity while submerged deep within the River Yamunā. When the //ṛṣi// felt sexual desire, he emerged from the water and went to King Māndhātā to ask that one of the King's daughters become his wife.
