//Yajñas// performed by //brāhmaṇas// according to Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are so potent that the sanctifying of water by Vedic //mantras// can bring about the desired result. In this instance, the //brāhmaṇas// sanctified the water so that the King's wife might drink it in the //yajña,// but by providence the King himself went there at night and, being thirsty, drank the water.
