===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(Bg. 9.32)]], //striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.// Women are not considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Downfall of Saubhari Muni."
