===== Purport =====

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a //vaiṣṇava-aparādha.// The history is that when Garuḍa wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuḍa's plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaiṣṇava. Because of this //vaiṣṇava-aparādha,// an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic //tapasya.// One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaiṣṇava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari Muni.
