===== Purport =====

Vāsudeva Datta made a similar statement to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, requesting the Lord to liberate all living entities in His presence. Vāsudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaiṣṇava is therefore described as being //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī,// very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiṣṇava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society.
