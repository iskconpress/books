===== Translation =====

**Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a śūdra guest arrived. Seeing the śūdra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.**

===== Purport =====

Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he never distinguished between the //brāhmaṇa// and the //śūdra,// the poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called //sama-darśinaḥ// (//paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]). One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the //brāhmaṇa// and the //śūdra,// the poor (//daridra//) and the rich (//dhanī//). Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.
