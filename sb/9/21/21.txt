===== Purport =====

This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of //Bhagavad-gītā// that the orders of society---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//---are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (//guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]). All the descendants of Ajamīḍha, who was a //kṣatriya,// became //brāhmaṇas.// This was certainly because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons of //brāhmaṇas// or //kṣatriyas// become //vaiśyas// (//brāhmaṇa-vaiśyatāṁ gatāḥ//). When a //kṣatriya// or //brāhmaṇa// adopts the occupation or duty of a //vaiśya// (//kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]), he is certainly counted as a //vaiśya.// On the other hand, if one is born a //vaiśya,// by his activities he can become a //brāhmaṇa.// This is confirmed by Nārada Muni. //Yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.// The members of the //varṇas,// or social orders-//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//-must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.
