===== Purport =====

Here it is said, //kṣatraṁ brahma-bhūyaṁ gataṁ kṣitau:// although the Dhārṣṭas belonged to the //kṣatriya// caste, they were able to convert themselves into //brāhmaṇas.// This gives clear evidence supporting the following statement by Nārada [[books:sb:7:11:35|(SB 7.11.35)]]:

> yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam
> yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet

If the qualities of one group are found in the men of another, those men should be recognized by their qualities, by their symptoms, not by the caste of the family in which they were born. Birth is not at all important; it is one's qualities that are stressed in all Vedic literature.
