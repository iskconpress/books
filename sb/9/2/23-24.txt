The son of Nābhāga was known as Bhalandana, the son of Bhalandana was Vatsaprīti, and his son was Prāṁśu.

===== Purport =====

From Manu, one son became a //kṣatriya,// another a //brāhmaṇa,// and another a //vaiśya.// This confirms the statement by Nārada Muni, //yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|(SB 7.11.35)]]. One should always remember that //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas// should never be regarded as members of a caste by birth. A //brāhmaṇa// may be changed into a //kṣatriya,// and a //kṣatriya// into a //brāhmaṇa.// Similarly, a //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya// may be changed into a //vaiśya,// and a //vaiśya// into a //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya.// This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]). So one is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// never by birth, but by quality. There is a great need of //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore, in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are trying to train some //brāhmaṇas// to guide human society. Because at present there is a scarcity of //brāhmaṇas,// the brain of human society is lost. Because practically everyone is a //śūdra,// no one at the present moment can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to achieve perfection in life.
