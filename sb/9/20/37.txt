===== Translation =====

**Mamatā very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered giving up the child. But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a name for the child.**

===== Purport =====

According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as //jāta-karma// and //nāma-karaṇa,// in which learned //brāhmaṇas,// immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamatā gave birth was begotten by Bṛhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamatā was the wife of Utathya, Bṛhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore Bṛhaspati became //bhartā.// According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called //dvāja.// The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is //doglā,// which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamatā, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvāja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamatā and Bṛhaspati.
