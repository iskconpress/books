{{description>Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Duṣmanta, had the mark of Lord Kṛṣṇa's disc on the palm of his right hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world. Then, under the priesthood of Māmateya, Bhṛgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices on the bank of the Yamunā, beginning from the confluence at Prayāga and ending at the source. He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brāhmaṇas. Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brāhmaṇas had one badva [13,084] as his share.}}

===== Translation =====

**Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Duṣmanta, had the mark of Lord Kṛṣṇa's disc on the palm of his right hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world. Then, under the priesthood of Māmateya, Bhṛgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices on the bank of the Yamunā, beginning from the confluence at Prayāga and ending at the source. He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brāhmaṇas. Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brāhmaṇas had one badva [13,084] as his share.**

===== Purport =====

As indicated here by the words //dauṣmanter agniḥ sācī-guṇe citaḥ,// Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the banks of the Ganges and Yamunā, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed in very distinguished places. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]], //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:// "Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." Everyone should engage in the performance of //yajña,// and the sacrificial fire should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in spiritual life. Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified //brāhmaṇas// who could perform such //yajñas.// For the present, however, the //Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa// enjoins:

> aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ
> sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam
> devareṇa sutotpattiṁ
> kalau pañca vivarjayet
> [[books:cc:adi:17:164|[Cc. Ādi 17.164]]]

"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of //sannyāsa,// offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of one's brother." In this age, such //yajñas// as the //aśvamedha-yajña// and //gomedha-yajña// are impossible to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified //brāhmaṇas.// This verse says, //māmateyaṁ purodhāya:// Mahārāja Bharata engaged the son of Mamatā, Bhṛgu Muni, to take charge of performing this //yajña.// Now, however, such //brāhmaṇas// are impossible to find. Therefore the //śāstras// recommend, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:// those who are intelligent should perform the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// inaugurated by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> saṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ

"In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña.//"(//SB// 11.5.32) //Yajña// must be performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa all over the world. This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is also //yajña,// but without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified //brāhmaṇas.// This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, all the purposes of //yajña// will be fulfilled. The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be any produce (//annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]). All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (//kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (//sarva-kāma-dughā mahī//). In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life-illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling-and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple //yajña// of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order.
