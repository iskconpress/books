===== Purport =====

Upon hearing the omen, Mahārāja Duṣmanta accepted his wife and child. According to Vedic //smṛti://

> pun-nāmno narakād yasmāt
> pitaraṁ trāyate sutaḥ
> tasmāt putra iti proktaḥ
> svayam eva svayambhuvā

Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called //put,// the son is called //putra.// According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered. Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature. A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition. This verse clearly says, //putro nayati naradeva yama-kṣayāt:// "The son saves his father from the custody of Yamarāja." It never says, //putro nayati mātaram:// "The son saves his mother." The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother. Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaiṣṇava, he can save both the father and mother from the custody of Yamarāja and punishment in hellish life.
