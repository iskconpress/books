===== Translation =====

**When Śakuntalā responded to Mahārāja Duṣmanta's proposal with silence, the agreement was complete. Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic praṇava [oṁkāra], in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.**

===== Purport =====

The //oṁkāra, praṇava,// is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters. //Bhagavad-gītā// says that the letters //a-u-m,// combined together as //oṁ,// represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who says in //Bhagavad-gītā// that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles. The word //vidhinā// means, "according to religious principles." The association of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.
