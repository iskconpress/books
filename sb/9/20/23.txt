**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: When Mahārāja Duṣmanta passed away from this earth, his son became the emperor of the world, the proprietor of the seven islands. He is referred to as a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this world.**

===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:41|(Bg. 10.41)]] it is said:

> yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
> śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
> tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
> mama tejo 'ṁśa-sambhavam

Anyone extraordinarily powerful must be considered a partial representation of the opulence of the Supreme Godhead. Therefore when the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta became the emperor of the entire world, he was celebrated in this way.
