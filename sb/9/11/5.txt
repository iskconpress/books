===== Purport =====

In the previous chapter it was said that the //prajās,// the citizens, strictly followed the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// The //brāhmaṇas// acted exactly like //brāhmaṇas,// the //kṣatriyas// exactly like //kṣatriyas,// and so on. Therefore, when Lord Rāmacandra gave everything in charity to the //brāhmaṇas,// the //brāhmaṇas,// being qualified, wisely considered that //brāhmaṇas// are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it. The qualifications of a //brāhmaṇa// are given in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:42|(Bg. 18.42)]]:

> śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ
> kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca
> jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ
> brahma-karma svabhāvajam

"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness---these are the qualities by which the //brāhmaṇas// work." The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a //kṣatriya.// Therefore, although the //brāhmaṇas// did not refuse Lord Rāmacandra's gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The //brāhmaṇas// were so pleased with Lord Rāmacandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord Rāmacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a //kṣatriya// and was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a //kṣatriya// is to be charitable. A //kṣatriya,// or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases. //Dānam īśvara-bhāvaḥ.// On one hand, //kṣatriyas// have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity. When Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira gave charity, he engaged Karṇa to take charge of distributing it. Karṇa was very famous as Dātā Karṇa. The word //dātā// refers to one who gives charity very liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A //kṣatriya's// duty is to give charity, and a //brāhmaṇa's// duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together. Therefore, when the //brāhmaṇas// were given so much land by Lord Rāmacandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy.
