===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Thereafter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Rāmacandra, accepted an ācārya and performed sacrifices [yajñas] with opulent paraphernalia. Thus He Himself worshiped Himself, for He is the Supreme Lord of all demigods.**

===== Purport =====

//Sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā.// If Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, then everyone is worshiped. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:4:31:14|(4.31.14)]]:

> yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena
> tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ
> prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ
> tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā

"As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality." Performing //yajña// involves worshiping the Supreme Lord. Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is said, //bhagavān ātmanātmānam īje:// the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself. This does not, of course, justify the Māyāvāda philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //jīva,// the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The living entities (//vibhinnāṁśa//) never become one with the Lord, although Māyāvādīs sometimes imitate the Lord's worship of Himself. Lord Kṛṣṇa meditated upon Himself every morning as a //gṛhastha,// and similarly Lord Rāmacandra performed //yajñas// to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of //ahaṅgraha-upāsanā.// Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein.
