===== Translation =====

**Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world, was sufficiently old, he delivered the entire kingdom to his son Purūravā and entered the forest.**

===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of //varṇa// and //āśrama// must leave his family life after he reaches fifty years of age (//pañcāśad ūrdhvaṁ vanaṁ vrajet//). Thus Sudyumna followed the prescribed regulations of //varṇāśrama// by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his spiritual life.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, First Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman."
