===== Translation =====

**Other requirements are utensils, grains, clarified butter, honey, gold, earth, water, the Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda and Sāma Veda and four priests to perform the sacrifice.**

===== Purport =====

To perform a sacrifice successfully, at least four expert priests are needed: one who can offer (//hotā//), one who can chant (//udgātā//), one who can kindle the sacrificial fire without the aid of separate fire (//adhvaryu//), and one who can supervise (//brahmā//). Such sacrifices were conducted from the birth of Brahmā, the first living creature, and were carried on till the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. But such expert //brāhmaṇa// priests are very rare in this age of corruption and quarrel, and therefore in the present age only the //yajña// of chanting the holy name of the Lord is recommended. The scriptures enjoin:

> harer nāma harer nāma
> harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva
> nāsty eva gatir anyathā
