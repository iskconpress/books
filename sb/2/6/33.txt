===== Translation =====

**My dear son, whatever you inquired from me I have thus explained unto you, and you must know for certain that whatever there is (either as cause or as effect, both in the material and spiritual worlds) is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

The complete cosmic situation, both in the material and in the spiritual manifestations of the energies of the Lord, is working and moving first as the cause and then as the effect. But the original cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Effects of the original cause become the causes of other effects, and thus everything, either permanent or temporary, is working as cause and effect. And because the Lord is the primeval cause of all persons and all energies, He is called the cause of all causes, as confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// as well as in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// The //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.1) affirms:

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam

And in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]] it is said:

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ

So the original primeval cause is //vigraha,// the personal, and the impersonal spiritual effulgence, //brahmajyoti,// is also an effect of the Supreme Brahman (//brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham [//14.27]), Lord Kṛṣṇa.
