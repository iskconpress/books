===== Translation =====

**Thereafter, the Manus, the fathers of mankind, the great sages, the forefathers, the learned scholars, the Daityas and mankind performed sacrifices meant to please the Supreme Lord.**

===== Purport =====

The //daityas// are devotees of the demigods because they want to derive the greatest possible material facilities from them. The devotees of the Lord are //eka-niṣṭha,// or absolutely attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore they have practically no time to seek the benefits of material facilities. Because of their realization of their spiritual identity, they are more concerned with spiritual emancipation than with material comforts.
