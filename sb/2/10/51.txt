===== Purport =====

Any question that is put forward may be answered by quoting the authority, and that satisfies the saner section. That is the system even in the law court. The best lawyer gives evidence from the past judgment of the court without taking much trouble to establish his case. This is called the //paramparā// system, and learned authorities follow it without manufacturing rubbish interpretations.

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> (Bs. 5.1)

Let us all obey the Supreme Lord, whose hand is in everything, without exception.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "//Bhāgavatam// Is the Answer to All Questions."
