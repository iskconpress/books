===== Purport =====

Lord Brahmājī said to Nārada that his impression that Brahmā was not the supreme authority in the creation was correct. Sometimes less intelligent men have the foolish impression that Brahmā is the cause of all causes. But Nārada wanted to clear the matter by the statements of Brahmājī, the supreme authority in the universe. As the decision of the supreme court of a state is final, similarly the judgment of Brahmājī, the supreme authority in the universe, is final in the Vedic process of acquiring knowledge. As we have already affirmed in the previous verse, Nāradajī was a liberated soul; therefore, he was not one of the less intelligent men who accept a false god or gods in their own ways. He represented himself as less intelligent and yet intelligently presented a doubt to be cleared by the supreme authority so that the uninformed might take note of it and be rightly informed about the intricacies of the creation and the creator.

In this verse Brahmājī clears up the wrong impression held by the less intelligent and affirms that he creates the universal variegatedness after the potential creation by the glaring effulgence of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Brahmājī has also separately given this statement in the //saṁhitā// known as the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.40), where he says:

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental bodily effulgence, known as the //brahmajyoti,// which is unlimited, unfathomed and all-pervasive, is the cause of the creation of unlimited numbers of planets, etc., with varieties of climates and specific conditions of life."

The same statement is in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:27|(Bg. 14.27)]]. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the background of the //brahmajyoti// (//brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham//). In the //Nirukti,// or Vedic dictionary, the import of //pratiṣṭhā// is mentioned as "that which establishes." So the //brahmajyoti// is not independent or self-sufficient. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is ultimately the creator of the //brahmajyoti,// mentioned in this verse as //sva-rociṣā,// or the effulgence of the transcendental body of the Lord. This //brahmajyoti// is all-pervading, and all creation is made possible by its potential power; therefore the Vedic hymns declare that everything that exists is being sustained by the //brahmajyoti// (//sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma//). Therefore the potential seed of all creation is the //brahmajyoti,// and the same //brahmajyoti,// unlimited and unfathomed, is established by the Lord. Therefore the Lord (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) is ultimately the supreme cause of all creation (//ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]).

One should not expect the Lord to create like a blacksmith with a hammer and other instruments. The Lord creates by His potencies. He has His multifarious potencies (//parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]//). Just as the small seed of a banyan fruit has the potency to create a big banyan tree, the Lord disseminates all varieties of seeds by His potential //brahmajyoti// (//sva-rociṣā//), and the seeds are made to develop by the watering process of persons like Brahmā. Brahmā cannot create the seeds, but he can manifest the seed into a tree, just as a gardener helps plants and orchards to grow by the watering process. The example cited here of the sun is very appropriate. In the material world the sun is the cause of all illumination: fire, electricity, the rays of the moon, etc. All luminaries in the sky are creations of the sun, the sun is the creation of the //brahmajyoti,// and the //brahmajyoti// is the effulgence of the Lord. Thus the ultimate cause of creation is the Lord.
