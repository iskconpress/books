===== Purport =====

According to //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:9|(Bg. 10.9)]] the characteristics of pure devotees are wonderful. The complete functional activities of a pure devotee are always engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the pure devotees exchange feelings of ecstasy between themselves and relish transcendental bliss. This transcendental bliss is experienced even in the stage of devotional practice (//sādhana-avasthā//), if properly undertaken under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. And in the mature stage the developed transcendental feeling culminates in realization of the particular relationship with the Lord by which a living entity is originally constituted (up to the relationship of conjugal love with the Lord, which is estimated to be the highest transcendental bliss). Thus //bhakti-yoga,// being the only means of God realization, is called //kaivalya.// Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī quotes the Vedic version (//eko nārāyaṇo devaḥ, parāvarāṇāṁ parama āste kaivalya-saṁjñitaḥ//) in this connection and establishes that Nārāyaṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is known as //kaivalya,// and the means which enables one to approach the Lord is called the //kaivalya-panthā,// or the only means of attainment of Godhead. This //kaivalya-panthā// begins from //śravaṇa,// or hearing those topics that relate to the Personality of Godhead, and the natural consequence of hearing such //hari-kathā// is attainment of transcendental knowledge, which causes detachment from all mundane topics, for which a devotee has no taste at all. For a devotee, all mundane activities, social and political, become unattractive, and in the mature state such a devotee becomes uninterested even in his own body, and what to speak of bodily relatives. In such a state of affairs one is not agitated by the waves of the material modes. There are different modes of material nature, and all mundane functions in which a common man is very much interested or in which he takes part become unattractive for the devotee. This state of affairs is described herein as //pratinivṛtta-guṇormi,// and it is possible by //ātma-prasāda,// or complete self-satisfaction without any material connection. The first-class devotee of the Lord attains this stage by devotional service, but despite his loftiness, for the Lord's satisfaction he may play the voluntary part of a preacher of the Lord's glory and dovetail all into devotional service, even mundane interest, just to give the neophytes a chance to transform mundane interest into transcendental bliss. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described this action of a pure devotee as //nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.// Even mundane activities dovetailed with service to the Lord are also calculated to be transcendental or approved //kaivalya// affairs.
