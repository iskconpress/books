===== Purport =====

As we have already quoted above from the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// of Rūpa Gosvāmī, even mundane things, if dovetailed in the service of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, are accepted as transcendental. For example, the epics or the histories of //Rāmāyaṇa// and //Mahābhārata,// which are specifically recommended for the less intelligent classes (women, //śūdras// and unworthy sons of the higher castes), are also accepted as Vedic literature because they are compiled in connection with the activities of the Lord. //Mahābhārata// is accepted as the fifth division of the //Vedas// after its first four divisions, namely //Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg// and //Atharva.// The less intelligent do not accept //Mahābhārata// as part of the //Vedas,// but great sages and authorities accept it as the fifth division of the //Vedas. Bhagavad-gītā// is also part of the //Mahābhārata,// and it is full of the Lord's instruction for the less intelligent class of men. Some less intelligent men say that //Bhagavad-gītā// is not meant for householders, but such foolish men forget that //Bhagavad-gītā// was explained to Arjuna, a //gṛhastha// (family man), and spoken by the Lord in His role as a //gṛhastha.// So //Bhagavad-gītā,// although containing the high philosophy of the Vedic wisdom, is for the beginners in the transcendental science, and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is for graduates and postgraduates in the transcendental science. Therefore literatures like //Mahābhārata, the, purāṇas// and similar other literatures which are full of the pastimes of the Lord, are all transcendental literatures, and they should be discussed with full confidence in the society of great devotees.

The difficulty is that such literatures, when discussed by professional men, appear to be mundane literature like histories or epics because there are so many historical facts and figures. It is said here, therefore, that such literatures should be discussed in the assembly of devotees. Unless they are discussed by devotees, such literatures cannot be relished by the higher class of men. So the conclusion is that the Lord is not impersonal in the ultimate issue. He is the Supreme Person, and He has His different activities. He is the leader of all living entities, and He descends at His will and by His personal energy to reclaim the fallen souls. Thus He plays exactly like the social, political or religious leaders. Because such roles ultimately culminate in the discussion of topics of the Lord, all such preliminary topics are also transcendental. That is the way of spiritualizing the civic activities of human society. Men have inclinations for studying history and many other mundane literatures---stories, fiction, dramas, magazines, newspapers, etc.---so let them be dovetailed with the transcendental service of the Lord, and all of them will turn to the topics relished by all devotees. The propaganda that the Lord is impersonal, that He has no activity and that He is a dumb stone without any name and form has encouraged people to become godless, faithless demons, and the more they deviate from the transcendental activities of the Lord, the more they become accustomed to mundane activities that only clear their path to hell instead of return them home, back to Godhead. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// begins from the history of the Pāṇḍavas (with necessary politics and social activities), and yet //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is said to be the //Pāramahaṁsa-saṁhitā,// or the Vedic literature meant for the topmost transcendentalist, and it describes //paraṁ jñānam,// the highest transcendental knowledge. pure devotees of the Lord are all //paramahaṁsas,// and they are like the swans, who know the art of sucking milk out of a mixture of milk and water.
