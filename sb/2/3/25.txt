**O Sūta Gosvāmī, your words are pleasing to our minds. Please therefore explain this to us as it was spoken by the great devotee Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who is very expert in transcendental knowledge, and who spoke to Mahārāja Parīkṣit upon being asked.**

===== Purport =====

Knowledge explained by the previous //ācārya// like Śukadeva Gosvāmī and followed by the next like Sūta Gosvāmī is always powerful transcendental knowledge, and it is therefore penetrating and useful to all submissive students.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Third Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Pure Devotional Service: The Change in Heart."
