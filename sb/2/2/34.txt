===== Purport =====

Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī is referring to the highest Vedic authority, Lord Brahmā, who is the qualitative incarnation of Godhead. The //Vedas// were taught to Brahmājī in the beginning of the material creation. Although Brahmājī was to hear Vedic instructions directly from the Personality of Godhead, in order to satisfy the inquisitiveness of all prospective students of the //Vedas,// Brahmājī, just like a scholar, studied the //Vedas// three times, as generally done by all scholars. He studied with great attention, concentrating on the purpose of the //Vedas,// and after scrutinizingly examining the whole process, he ascertained that becoming a pure, unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the topmost perfection of all religious principles. And this is the last instruction of the //Bhagavad-gītā// directly presented by the Personality of Godhead. The Vedic conclusion is thus accepted by all //ācāryas,// and those who are against this conclusion are only //veda-vāda-ratas,// as explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:42|(Bg. 2.42)]].
