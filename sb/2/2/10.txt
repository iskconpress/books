===== Purport =====

The ornaments, flowers, clothing and all the other decorations on the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead are identical with the body of the Lord. None of them are made of material ingredients; otherwise there would be no chance of their decorating the body of the Lord. As such, in the //paravyoma,// spiritual varieties are also distinguished from the material variegatedness.
