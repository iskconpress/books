===== Purport =====

The sufferings of human society are due to a polluted aim of life, namely lording it over the material resources. The more human society engages in the exploitation of undeveloped material resources for sense gratification, the more it will be entrapped by the illusory, material energy of the Lord, and thus the distress of the world will be intensified instead of diminished. The human necessities of life are fully supplied by the Lord in the shape of food grains, milk, fruit, wood, stone, sugar, silk, jewels, cotton, salt, water, vegetables, etc., in sufficient quantity to feed and care for the human race of the world as well as the living beings on each and every planet within the universe. The supply source is complete, and only a little energy by the human being is required to get his necessities into the proper channel. There is no need of machines and tools or huge steel plants for artificially creating comforts of life. Life is never made comfortable by artificial needs, but by plain living and high thinking. The highest perfectional thinking for human society is suggested here by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, namely, sufficiently hearing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// For men in this age of Kali, when they have lost the perfect vision of life, this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the torchlight by which to see the real path. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhupāda has commented on the //kathāmṛtam// mentioned in this verse and has indicated //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to be the nectarean message of the Personality of Godhead. By sufficient hearing of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the polluted aim of life, namely lording it over matter, will subside, and the people in general in all parts of the world will be able to live a peaceful life of knowledge and bliss.

For a pure devotee of the Lord, any topics in relation with His name, fame, quality, entourage, etc., are all pleasing, and because such topics have been approved by great devotees like Nārada, Hanumān, Nanda Mahārāja and other inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, certainly such messages are transcendental and pleasing to the heart and soul.

And by the constant hearing of the messages of the //Bhagavad-gītā,// and later of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// one is assured herein by Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī that he will reach the Personality of Godhead and render Him transcendental loving service in the spiritual planet of the name Goloka Vṛndāvana, which resembles a huge lotus flower.

Thus by the process of //bhakti-yoga,// directly accepted, as suggested in this verse, by sufficient hearing of the transcendental message of the Lord, the material contamination is directly eliminated without one's attempting to contemplate the impersonal //virāṭ// conception of the Lord. And by practicing //bhakti-yoga,// if the performer is not purified from the material contamination, he must be a pseudodevotee. For such an imposter there is no remedy for being freed from material entanglement.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Second Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Lord in the Heart."
