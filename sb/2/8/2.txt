===== Translation =====

**The King said: I wish to know. Narrations concerning the Lord, who possesses wonderful potencies, are certainly auspicious for living beings in all planets.**

===== Purport =====

//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is full of narrations of the activities of the Supreme Lord, is auspicious for all living beings residing in every planet. One who takes it as belonging to a particular sect is certainly mistaken. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is certainly a very dear scripture for all the devotees of the Lord, but it is auspicious even for the nondevotees also because it explains that even the nondevotees hovering under the spell of material energy can be delivered from such clutches if they hear the narration of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// with devotion and attention from the right source representing the Lord by disciplic succession.
