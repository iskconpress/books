===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead who, for the creation of the material world, accepts the three modes of nature. He is the complete whole residing within the body of everyone, and His ways are inconceivable.**

===== Purport =====

This material world is a manifestation of the three modes goodness, passion and ignorance, and the Supreme Lord, for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the material world, accepts three predominating forms as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śaṅkara (Śiva). As Viṣṇu He enters into every body materially created. As Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu He enters into every universe, and as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu He enters the body of every living being. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, being the origin of all //viṣṇu-tattvas,// is addressed here as //paraḥ pumān,// or Puruṣottama, as described in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:18|(Bg. 15.18)]]. He is the complete whole. The //puruṣāvatāras// are therefore His plenary expansions. //Bhakti-yoga// is the only process by which one can become competent to know Him. Because the empiric philosophers and mystic //yogīs// cannot conceive of the Personality of Godhead, He is called //anupalakṣya-vartmane,// the Lord of the inconceivable way, or //bhakti-yoga.//
