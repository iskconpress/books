===== Purport =====

To unfold the mystery of //bhakti-yoga,// as it is explained in the previous verse, is the ultimate stage of all inquiries or the highest objective for the inquisitive. Everyone is searching after self-realization in different ways---by //karma-yoga,// by //jñāna-yoga,// by //dhyāna-yoga,// by //rāja-yoga,// by //bhakti-yoga,// etc. To engage in self-realization is the responsibility of every living entity developed in consciousness. One who is developed in consciousness certainly makes inquiries into the mystery of the self, of the cosmic situation and of the problems of life, in all spheres and fields---social, political, economic, cultural, religious, moral, etc.---and in their different branches. But here the goal of all such inquiries is explained.

The //Vedānta-sūtra// philosophy begins with this inquiry about life, and the //Bhāgavatam// answers such inquiries up to this point, or the mystery of all inquiries. Lord Brahmā wanted to be perfectly educated by the Personality of Godhead, and here is the answer by the Lord, finished in four nutshell verses, from //aham eva// to this verse, //etāvad eva.// This is the end of all self-realization processes. Men do not know that the ultimate goal of life is Viṣṇu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, due to being bewildered by the glaring reflection in the darkness, and as such everyone is entering into the darkest region of material existence, driven by the uncontrolled senses. The whole material existence has sprung up because of sense gratification, desires based principally on the sex desire, and the result is that in spite of all advancement of knowledge, the final goal of all the activities of the living entities is sense gratification. But here is the real goal of life, and everyone should know it by inquiries put before a bona fide spiritual master expert in the science of //bhakti-yoga,// or from a living personality of //Bhāgavatam// life. Everyone is engaged in various kinds of scriptural inquiries, but the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// gives answers to all of the various students of self-realization: this ultimate objective of life is not to be searched out without great labor or perseverance. One who is imbued with such sincere inquiries must ask the bona fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession from Brahmājī, and that is the direction given here. Because the mystery was disclosed before Brahmājī by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the mystery of all such inquiries regarding self-realization must be put before such a spiritual master, who is directly the representative of the Lord, acknowledged in that disciplic succession. Such a bona fide spiritual master is able to clear up the whole thing by evidence from the revealed scriptures, both direct and indirect. Although everyone is free to consult the revealed scriptures in this connection, one still requires the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, and that is the direction in this verse. The bona fide spiritual master is the most confidential representative of the Lord, and one must receive direction from the spiritual master in the same spirit that Brahmājī received it from the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. The bona fide spiritual master in that bona fide chain of disciplic succession never claims to be the Lord Himself, although such a spiritual master is greater than the Lord in the sense that he can deliver the Lord by his personally realized experience. The Lord is not to be found simply by education or by a good fertile brain, but surely He can be found by the sincere student through the transparent medium of the bona fide spiritual master.

The revealed scriptures give directions directly to this end, but because the bewildered living entities are blinded by the glaring reflection in the darkness, they are unable to find the truth of the revealed scriptures. For example, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// the whole direction is targeted toward the Personality of Godhead Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but for want of a bona fide spiritual master in the line of Brahmājī or the direct hearer, Arjuna, there are different distortions of the revealed knowledge by many unauthorized persons who just want to satisfy their own whims. Undoubtedly the //Bhagavad-gītā// is accepted as one of the most brilliant stars in the horizon of the spiritual sky, yet the interpretations of this great book of knowledge have so grossly been distorted that every student of the //Bhagavad-gītā// is still in the same darkness of glaring material reflections. Such students are hardly enlightened by the //Bhagavad-gītā.// In the //Gītā// practically the same instruction is imparted as in the four prime verses of the //Bhāgavatam,// but due to wrong and fashionable interpretations by unauthorized persons, one cannot reach the ultimate conclusion. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:61|(Bg. 18.61)]] it is clearly said:

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā

The Lord is situated in the hearts of all living beings (as Paramātmā), and He is controlling all of them in the material world under the agency of His external energy. Therefore it is clearly mentioned that the Lord is the supreme controller and that the living entities are controlled by the Lord. In the same //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:65|(Bg. 18.65)]] the Lord directs as follows:

> man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
> mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru
> mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te
> pratijāne priyo 'si me

It is clear from this verse of the //Bhagavad-gītā// that the direction of the Lord is that one should be God-minded, a devotee of the Lord, a worshiper of the Lord, and must offer all obeisances unto Lord Kṛṣṇa. By so doing, the devotee will undoubtedly go back to Godhead, back to home.

Indirectly it is said that the whole Vedic social construction of human society is so made that everyone acts as a part and parcel of the complete body of the Lord. The intelligent class of men, or the //brāhmaṇas,// are situated on the face of the Lord; the administrative class of men, the //kṣatriyas,// are situated on the arms of the Lord; the productive class of men, the //vaiśyas,// are situated on the belt of the Lord; and the laborer class of men, the //śūdras,// are situated on the legs of the Lord. Therefore the complete social construction is the body of the Lord, and all the parts of the body, namely the //brāhmaṇas,// the //kṣatriyas,// the //vaiśyas// and the //śūdras,// are meant to serve the Lord's whole body conjointly; otherwise the parts become unfit to be coordinated with the supreme consciousness of oneness. Universal consciousness is factually achieved by coordinated service of all concerned to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that alone can insure total perfection. Therefore even the great scientists, the great philosophers, the great mental speculators, the great politicians, the great industrialists, the great social reformers, etc., cannot give any relief to the restless society of the material world because they do not know the secret of success as mentioned in this verse of the //Bhāgavatam,// namely that one must know the mystery of //bhakti-yoga.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:15|(Bg. 7.15)]] also it is said:

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ

Because the so-called great leaders of human society are ignorant of this great knowledge of //bhakti-yoga// and are always engaged in ignoble acts of sense gratification, bewildered by the external energy of the Lord, they are stubborn rebels against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they never agree to surrender unto Him because they are fools, miscreants and the lowest type of human beings. Such faithless nonbelievers may be highly educated in the material sense of the term, but factually they are the greatest fools of the world because by the influence of the external, material nature all their so-called acquisition of knowledge has been made null and void. Therefore all advancement of knowledge in the present context of things is being misused by cats and dogs fighting with one another for sense gratification, and all acquisition of knowledge in science, philosophy, fine arts, nationalism, economic development, religion and great activities are being spoiled by being used as dresses for dead men. There is no utility in the dresses used for covering a coffin of a dead body save getting false applause from the ignorant public. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// therefore says again and again that without attainment of the status of //bhakti-yoga,// all the activities of human society are to be considered absolute failures only. It is said:

> parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto
> yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam
> yāvat kriyās tāvad idaṁ mano vai
> karmātmakaṁ yena śarīra-bandhaḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:5|(SB 5.5.5)]]

As long as one is blind to inquiring after self-realization, all material activities, however great they may be, are all different kinds of defeat because the aim of human life is not fulfilled by such unwanted and profitless activities. The function of the human body is to attain freedom from material bondage, but as long as one is fully absorbed in material activities, his mind will be overwhelmed in the whirlpool of matter, and thus he will continue to be encaged in material bodies life after life.

> evaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte
> avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne
> prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve
> na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat
> [[books:sb:5:5:6|(SB 5.5.6)]]

It is one's mind that generates different kinds of bodies for suffering different kinds of material pangs. Therefore as long as the mind is absorbed in fruitive activities, the mind is understood to be absorbed in nescience, and thus one is sure to be subjected to material bondage in different bodies again and again until one develops a transcendental love for Godhead, Vāsudeva, the Supreme Person. To become absorbed in the transcendental name, quality, form and activities of the Supreme Person, Vāsudeva, means to change the temper of the mind from matter to absolute knowledge, which leads one to the path of absolute realization and thus frees one from the bondage of material contact and encagements in different material bodies.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhupāda therefore comments on the words //sarvatra sarvadā// in the sense that the principles of //bhakti-yoga,// or devotional service to the Lord, are apt in all circumstances; i.e., //bhakti-yoga// is recommended in all the revealed scriptures, it is performed by all authorities, it is important in all places, it is useful in all causes and effects, etc. As far as all the revealed scriptures are concerned, he quotes from the //Skanda Purāṇa// on the topics of Brahmā and Nārada as follows:

> saṁsāre 'smin mahā-ghore
> janma-mṛtyu-samākule
> pūjanaṁ vāsudevasya
> tārakaṁ vādibhiḥ smṛtam

In the material world, which is full of darkness and dangers, combined with birth and death and full of different anxieties, the only way to get out of the great entanglement is to accept loving transcendental devotional service to Lord Vāsudeva. This is accepted by all classes of philosophers.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī also quotes another common passage, which is found in three //Purāṇas,// namely the //Padma Purāṇa, Skanda Purāṇa// and //Liṅga Purāṇa.// It runs as follows:

> āloḍya sarva-śāstrāni
> vicārya ca punaḥ punaḥ
> idam ekaṁ suniṣpannaṁ
> dhyeyo nārāyaṇaḥ sadā

"By scrutinizingly reviewing all the revealed scriptures and judging them again and again, it is now concluded that Lord Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, and thus He alone should be worshiped."

The same truth is also indirectly described in the //Garuḍa Purāṇa// as follows:

> pāraṁ gato 'pi vedānāṁ
> sarva-śāstrārtha-vedy api
> yo na sarveśvare bhaktas
> taṁ vidyāt puruṣādhamam

"Even though one may have gone to the other side of all the //Vedas,// and even though one is well versed in all the revealed scriptures, if one is not a devotee of the Supreme Lord, he must be considered the lowest of mankind." Similarly, it is also stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:18:12|(5.18.12)]] indirectly as follows:

> yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā
> sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ
> harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā
> mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ

One who has unflinching devotion unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead must have all the good qualities of the demigods, and contrarily one who is not a devotee of the Lord must be hovering in the darkness of mental speculation and thus must be engaged in material impermanence. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.11.18) says:

> śabda-brahmaṇi niṣṇāto
> na niṣṇāyāt pare yadi
> śramas tasya śrama-phalo
> hy adhenum iva rakṣataḥ

"One may be well versed in all the transcendental literature of the //Vedas,// but if he fails to be acquainted with the Supreme, then it must be concluded that all of his education is like the burden of a beast or like one's keeping a cow without milking capacity."

Similarly, the liberty of discharging loving transcendental service to the Lord is invested in everyone, even the women, the //śūdras,// the forest tribes, or any other living beings born in sinful conditions.

> te vai vidanty atitaranti ca deva-māyāṁ
> strī-śūdra-hūṇa-śabarā api pāpa-jīvāḥ
> yady adbhuta-krama-parāyaṇa-śīlaśikṣās
> tiryag-janā api kimu śruta-dhāraṇā ye
> [[books:sb:2:7:46|(SB 2.7.46)]]

The lowest of human beings can be elevated to the highest stage of devotional life if they are trained by the bona fide spiritual master well versed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. If the lowest can be so elevated, then what to speak of the highest, who are well versed in the Vedic knowledge? The conclusion is that devotional service to the Lord is open for all, regardless of who they are. That is the confirmation of its application for all kinds of performers of the service.

Therefore the devotional service of the Lord with perfect knowledge through the training of a bona fide spiritual master is advised for everyone, even if one happens not to be a human being. This is confirmed in the //Garuḍa Purāṇa// as follows:

> kīṭa-pakṣi-mṛgāṇāṁ ca
> harau sannyasta-cetasām
> ūrdhvām eva gatiṁ manye
> kiṁ punar jñānināṁ nṛṇām

"Even the worms, birds and beasts are assured of elevation to the highest perfectional life if they are completely surrendered to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, so what to speak of the philosophers amongst the human beings?"

Therefore there is no need to seek properly qualified candidates for discharging devotional service to the Lord. Let them be either well behaved or ill trained, let them be either learned or fools, let them be either grossly attached or in the renounced order of life, let them be liberated souls or desirous of salvation, let them be inexpert in the discharge of devotional service or expert in the same, all of them can be elevated to the supreme position by discharging devotional service under the proper guidance. This is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// (9.30, 32) as follows:

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim

Even if a person is fully addicted to all sorts of sinful acts, if he happens to be engaged in the loving transcendental service of the Lord under proper guidance, he is to be considered the most perfect holy man without a doubt. And thus any person, whatsoever and whosoever he or she may be---even the fallen woman, the less intelligent laborer, the dull mercantile man, or even a man lower than all these---can attain the highest perfection of life by going back home, back to Godhead, provided he or she takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in all earnestness. This sincere earnestness is the only qualification that can lead one to the highest perfectional stage of life, and unless and until such real earnestness is aroused, there is a difference between cleanliness or uncleanliness, learning or nonlearning, in the material estimation. Fire is always fire, and thus if someone touches the fire, knowingly or unknowingly, the fire will act in its own way without discrimination. The principle is: //harir harati pāpāni duṣṭa-cittair api smṛtaḥ.// The all-powerful Lord can purify the devotee of all sinful reactions, just as the sun can sterilize all sorts of infections by its powerful rays. "Attraction for material enjoyment cannot act upon a pure devotee of the Lord." There are hundreds and thousands of aphorisms in the revealed scriptures. //Ātmārāmāś ca munayaḥ:// "Even the self-realized souls are also attracted by the transcendental loving service of the Lord." //Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ:// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]] "Simply by hearing and chanting, one becomes a great devotee of Lord Vāsudeva." //Na calati bhagavat-padāravindāl lavanimiṣārdham api sa vaiṣṇavāgryaḥ:// "A person who does not move from the lotus feet of the Lord even for a moment or a second is to be considered the greatest of all Vaiṣṇavas." //Bhagavat-pārṣadatāṁ prāpte mat-sevayā pratītaṁ te:// "The pure devotees are convinced of attaining the association of the Personality of Godhead, and thus they are always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord." Therefore in all continents, in all planets, in all universes, devotional service to the Lord, or //bhakti-yoga,// is current, and that is the statement of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and allied scriptures. Everywhere means in every part of the creation of the Lord. The Lord can be served by all the senses, or even simply by the mind. The South Indian //brāhmaṇa// who served the Lord simply on the strength of his mind also factually realized the Lord. Success is guaranteed for a devotee who fully engages any one of his senses in the mode of devotional service. The Lord can be served by any ingredient, even the most common commodity---a flower, a leaf, a fruit or a little water, which are available in any part of the universe and without cost---and thus the Lord is served universally by the universal entities. He can be served simply by hearing, He can be served simply by chanting or reading about His activities, He can be served simply by adoring Him and accepting Him.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is stated that one can serve the Lord by offering the result of one's own work; it does not matter what one does. Generally men may say that whatever they are doing is inspired by God, but that is not all. One should actually work on behalf of God as a servant of God. The Lord says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:27|(Bg. 9.27)]]:

> yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi
> yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat
> yat tapasyasi kaunteya
> tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam

Do whatever you like or whatever may be easier for you to do, eat whatever you may eat, sacrifice whatever you can sacrifice, give whatever you may give in charity, and do whatever you may undertake in penance, but everything must be done for Him only. If you do business or if you accept some employment, do so on behalf of the Lord. Whatever you may eat, you may offer the same to the Lord and be assured that He will return the food after eating it Himself. He is the complete whole, and therefore whatever He may eat as offered by the devotee is accepted because of the devotee's love, but again it is returned as //prasāda// for the devotee so that he can be happy by eating. In other words, be a servant of God and live peacefully in that consciousness, ultimately returning home, back to Godhead.

It is said in the //Skanda Purāṇa://

> yasya smṛtyā ca nāmoktyā
> tapo-yajña-kriyādiṣu
> nūnaṁ sampūrṇatām eti
> sadyo vande tam acyutam

"I offer my obeisances unto Him, the infallible, because simply by either remembering Him or vibrating His holy name one can attain the perfection of all penances, sacrifices or fruitive activities, and this process can be universally followed." It is enjoined [[books:sb:2:3:10|(SB 2.3.10)]]:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

Though a person be full of desires or have no desires, he may follow this path of infallible //bhakti-yoga// for complete perfection." One need not be anxious to propitiate each and every demigod and goddess because the root of all of them is the Personality of Godhead. As by pouring water on the root of the tree one serves and enlivens all the branches and leaves, so by rendering service unto the Supreme Lord one automatically serves every god and goddess without extraneous effort. The Lord is all-pervading, and therefore service unto Him is also all-pervading. This fact is corroborated in the //Skanda Purāṇa// as follows:

> arcite deva-deveśe
> śaṅkha-cakra-gadā-dhare
> arcitāḥ sarva-devāḥ syur
> yataḥ sarva-gato hariḥ

When the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, who carries in His hands a conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower, is worshiped, certainly all other demigods are worshiped automatically because Hari, the Personality of Godhead, is all-pervading. Therefore, in all cases, namely nominative, objective, causative, dative, ablative, possessive and supportive, everyone is benefited by such transcendental loving service to the Lord. The man who worships the Lord, the Lord Himself who is worshiped, the cause for which the Lord is worshiped, the source of supply, the place where such worship is done, etc.---everything is benefited by such an action.

Even during the annihilation of the material world, the process of //bhakti-yoga// can be applied. //Kālena naṣṭā pralaye vāṇīyam:// the Lord is worshiped in devastation because He protects the //Vedas// from being annihilated. He is worshiped in every millennium or //yuga.// As it is said in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.3.52):

> kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
> tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
> dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
> kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt

In the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// it is written:

> sa hānis tan mahac chidraṁ
> sa mohaḥ sa ca vibhramaḥ
> yan-muhūrtaṁ kṣaṇaṁ vāpi
> vāsudevaṁ na cintayet

"If even for a moment remembrance of Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is missed, that is the greatest loss, that is the greatest illusion, and that is the greatest anomaly." The Lord can be worshiped in all stages of life. For instance, even in the wombs of their mothers Mahārāja Prahlāda and Mahārāja Parīkṣit worshiped the Lord; even in his very childhood, at the age of only five years, Dhruva Mahārāja worshiped the Lord; even in full youth, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa worshiped the Lord; and even at the last stage of his frustration and old age Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra worshiped the Lord. Ajāmila worshiped the Lord even at the point of death, and Citraketu worshiped the Lord even in heaven and in hell. In the //Narasiṁha Purāṇa// it is said that as the hellish inhabitants began to chant the holy name of the Lord they began to be elevated from hell towards heaven. Durvāsā Muni has also supported this view: //mucyeta yan-nāmny udite nārako 'pi.// "Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord the inhabitants of hell became released from their hellish persecution." So the conclusion of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// as given by Śukadeva Gosvāmī to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, is:

> etan nirvidyamānānām
> icchatām akuto-bhayam
> yogināṁ nṛpa nirṇītaṁ
> harer nāmānukīrtanam

"O King, it is finally decided that everyone, namely those in the renounced order of life, the mystics, and the enjoyers of fruitive work, should chant the holy name of the Lord fearlessly to achieve the desired success in their pursuits." [[books:sb:2:1:11|(SB 2.1.11)]]

Similarly, as indicated indirectly in various places in revealed scriptures:

1. Even though one is well versed in all the //Vedas// and scriptures, if one is not a devotee of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, he is considered to be the lowest of mankind.

2. In the //Garuḍa Purāṇa, Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa// and //Padma Purāṇa,// the same is repeated: What is the use of Vedic knowledge and penances for one who is devoid of devotional service to the Lord?

3. What is the comparison of thousands of //prajāpatis// to one devotee of the Lord?

4. Śukadeva Gosvāmī said [[books:sb:2:4:17|(SB 2.4.17)]] that neither the ascetic, nor one who is greatly munificent, nor one who is famous, nor the great philosopher, nor the great occultist, nor anyone else can achieve the desired result without being engaged in the service of the Lord.

5. Even if a place is more glorious than heaven, if there is no glorification of the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha or His pure devotee, it should at once be quitted.

6. The pure devotee refuses to accept all the five different types of liberation in order to be engaged in the service of the Lord.

The final conclusion, therefore, is that the glories of the Lord must be always and everywhere proclaimed. One should hear about His glories, one should chant about His glories, and one should always remember His glories because that is the highest perfectional stage of life. As far as fruitive work is concerned, it is limited to an enjoyable body; as far as //yoga// is concerned, it is limited to the acquirement of mystic power; as far as empiric philosophy is concerned, it is limited to the attainment of transcendental knowledge; and as far as transcendental knowledge is concerned, it is limited to attainment of salvation. Even if they are adopted, there is every chance of discrepancies in discharging the particular type of functions. But adoption of the transcendental devotional service of the Lord has no limit, nor is there fear of falling down. The process automatically reaches the final stage by the grace of the Lord. In the preliminary stage of devotional service there is an apparent requisite for knowledge, but in the higher stage there is no necessity of such knowledge. The best and guaranteed path of progress is therefore engagement in //bhakti-yoga,// pure devotional service.

The cream of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the foregoing four //ślokas// is sometimes squeezed out by the impersonalist for different interpretations in their favor, but it should be carefully noted that the four //ślokas// were first described by the Personality of Godhead Himself, and thus the impersonalist has no scope to enter into them because he has no conception of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, the impersonalist may squeeze out any interpretations from them, but such interpretations will never be accepted by those who are taught in the disciplic succession from Brahmā, as will be cleared up in the following verses. Besides that, the //śruti// confirms that the Supreme Truth Absolute Personality of Godhead never reveals Himself to anyone who is falsely proud of his academic knowledge. The //śruti-mantra// clearly says (//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.23):

> nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo
> na medhayā na bahudhā śrutena
> yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas
> tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanuṁ svām

The whole matter is explained by the Lord Himself, and one who has no approach to the Lord in His personal feature can rarely understand the purport of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// without being taught by the //bhāgavatas// in the disciplic succession.
