===== Purport =====

As stated in the beginning of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// this great transcendental literature is the ripened fruit of the tree of Vedic knowledge, and therefore all questions that can be humanly possible regarding the universal affairs, beginning from its creation, are all answered in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The answers depend only on the qualification of the person who explains them. The ten divisions of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// as explained by the great speaker Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, are the limitation of all questions, and intelligent persons will derive all intellectual benefits from them by proper utilization.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Answers by Citing the Lord's Version."
