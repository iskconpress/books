**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, after being seen in His transcendental form, instructing Brahmājī, the leader of the living entities, disappeared.**

===== Purport =====

In this verse it is clearly mentioned that the Lord is //ajanaḥ,// or the Supreme Person, and that He was showing His transcendental form (//ātmano rūpam//) to Brahmājī while instructing him in the summarization of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in four verses. He is //ajanaḥ,// or the Supreme Person, amongst //janānām,// or all persons. All living entities are individual persons, and amongst all such persons Lord Hari is supreme, as confirmed in the //śruti-mantra, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// (//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13). So there is no place for impersonal features in the transcendental world as there are impersonal features in the material world. Whenever there is //cetana,// or knowledge, the personal feature comes in. In the spiritual world everything is full of knowledge, and therefore everything in the transcendental world, the land, the water, the tree, the mountain, the river, the man, the animal, the bird---everything---is of the same quality, namely //cetana,// and therefore everything there is individual and personal. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// gives us this information as the supreme Vedic literature, and it was personally instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to Brahmājī so that the leader of the living entities might broadcast the message to all in the universe in order to teach the supreme knowledge of //bhakti-yoga.// Brahmājī in his turn instructed Nārada, his beloved son, the same message of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and Nārada, in his turn, taught the same to Vyāsadeva, who again taught it to Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Through Śukadeva Gosvāmī's grace and by the mercy of Mahārāja Parīkṣit we are all given //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// perpetually to learn the science of the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.
