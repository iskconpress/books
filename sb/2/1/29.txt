===== Purport =====

The description of the gigantic form of the Personality of Godhead made in the Eleventh Chapter of the //Bhagavad-gītā// is further explained here in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The description in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:11:30|(Bg. 11.30)]] runs as follows: "O Viṣṇu, I see You devouring all people in Your blazing mouths and covering all the universe by Your immeasurable rays. Scorching the worlds, You are manifest." In that way, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the postgraduate study for the student of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Both of them are the science of Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth, and so they are interdependent.

The conception of the //virāṭ-puruṣa,// or the gigantic form of the Supreme Lord, is said to include all the dominating demigods as well as the dominated living beings. Even the minutest part of a living being is controlled by the empowered agency of the Lord. Since the demigods are included in the gigantic form of the Lord, worship of the Lord, whether in His gigantic material conception or in His eternal transcendental form as Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, also appeases the demigods and all the other parts and parcels, as much as watering the root of a tree distributes energy to all of the tree's other parts. Consequently, for a materialist also, worship of the universal gigantic form of the Lord leads one to the right path. One need not risk being misled by approaching many demigods for fulfillment of different desires. The real entity is the Lord Himself, and all others are imaginary, for everything is included in Him only.
