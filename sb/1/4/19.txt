**He saw that the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas were means by which the people's occupations could be purified. And to simplify the process he divided the one Veda into four, in order to expand them among men.**

===== Purport =====

Formerly there was only the //Veda// of the name //Yajur,// and the four divisions of sacrifices were there specifically mentioned. But to make them more easily performable, the //Veda// was divided into four divisions of sacrifice, just to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above the four //Vedas,// namely //Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma,// and //Atharva,// there are the //Purāṇas,// the //Mahābhārata, Saṁhitās,// etc., which are known as the fifth //Veda.// Śrī Vyāsadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalities, and they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this age of Kali. As such, the //Purāṇas// and //Mahābhārata// were made from related historical facts which explained the teaching of the four //Vedas.// There is no point in doubting the authority of the //Purāṇas// and //Mahābhārata// as parts and parcels of the //Vedas.// In the //Chāndogya Upaniṣad// (7.1.4), the //Purāṇas// and //Mahābhārata,// generally known as histories, are mentioned as the fifth //Veda.// According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, that is the way of ascertaining the respective values of the revealed scriptures.
