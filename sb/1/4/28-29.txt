===== Translation =====

**I have, under strict disciplinary vows, unpretentiously worshiped the Vedas, the spiritual master and the altar of sacrifice. I have also abided by the rulings and have shown the import of disciplic succession through the explanation of the Mahābhārata, by which even women, śūdras and others [friends of the twice-born] can see the path of religion.**

===== Purport =====

No one can understand the import of the //Vedas// without having undergone a strict disciplinary vow and disciplic succession. The //Vedas,// spiritual masters and sacrificial fire must be worshiped by the desiring candidate. All these intricacies of Vedic knowledge are systematically presented in the //Mahābhārata// for the understanding of the woman class, the laborer class and the unqualified members of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// families. In this age, the //Mahābhārata// is more essential than the original //Vedas.//
