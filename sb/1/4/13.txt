===== Translation =====

**We know that you are expert in the meaning of all subjects, except some portions of the Vedas, and thus you can clearly explain the answers to all the questions we have just put to you.**

===== Purport =====

The difference between the //Vedas// and the //Purāṇas// is like that between the //brāhmaṇas// and the //parivrājakas.// The //brāhmaṇas// are meant to administer some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the //Vedas,// but the //parivrājakācāryas,// or learned preachers, are meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge to one and all. As such, the //parivrājakācāryas// are not always expert in pronouncing the Vedic //mantras,// which are practiced systematically by accent and meter by the //brāhmaṇas// who are meant for administering Vedic rites. Yet it should not be considered that the //brāhmaṇas// are more important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different simultaneously because they are meant for the same end, in different ways.

There is no difference also between the Vedic //mantras// and what is explained in the //Purāṇas// and //Itihāsa.// According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, it is mentioned in the //Mādhyandina-śruti// that all the //Vedas,// namely the //Sāma, Atharva, Ṛg, Yajur, Purāṇas, Itihāsas, Upaniṣads,// etc., are emanations from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the Vedic //mantras// are mostly begun with //praṇava oṁkāra,// and it requires some training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic //mantras.// But that does not mean that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is of less importance than the Vedic //mantras.// On the contrary, it is the ripened fruit of all the //Vedas,// as stated before. Besides that, the most perfectly liberated soul, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, is absorbed in the studies of the //Bhāgavatam,// although he is already self-realized. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī is following his footsteps, and therefore his position is not the least less important because he was not expert in chanting Vedic //mantras// with metric pronunciation, which depends more on practice than actual realization. Realization is more important than parrotlike chanting.
