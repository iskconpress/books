===== Purport =====

Because //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the special contribution of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, there are so many inquiries by the learned Śaunaka Muni. It was known to them that Śrīla Vyāsadeva had already explained the text of the //Vedas// in various ways up to the //Mahābhārata// for the understanding of less intelligent women, //śūdras// and fallen members of the family of twice-born men. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is transcendental to all of them because it has nothing to do with anything mundane. So the inquiries are very intelligent and relevant.
