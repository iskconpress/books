===== Translation =====

**All these learned scholars, in their turn, rendered their entrusted Vedas unto their many disciples, grand-disciples and great grand-disciples, and thus the respective branches of the followers of the Vedas came into being.**

===== Purport =====

The original source of knowledge is the //Vedas.// There are no branches of knowledge, either mundane or transcendental, which do not belong to the original text of the //Vedas.// They have simply been developed into different branches, They were originally rendered by great, respectable and learned professors. In other words, the Vedic knowledge, broken into different branches by different disciplic successions, has been distributed all over the world. No one, therefore, can claim independent knowledge beyond the //Vedas.//
