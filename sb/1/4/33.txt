===== Translation =====

**At the auspicious arrival of Śrī Nārada, Śrī Vyāsadeva got up respectfully and worshiped him, giving him veneration equal to that given to Brahmājī, the creator.**

===== Purport =====

//Vidhi// means Brahmā, the first created living being. He is the original student as well as professor of the //Vedas.// He learned it from Śrī Kṛṣṇa and taught Nārada first. So Nārada is the second //ācārya// in the line of spiritual disciplic succession. He is the representative of Brahmā, and therefore he is respected exactly like Brahmā, the father of all //vidhis// (regulations); similarly all other successive disciples in the chain are also equally respected as representatives of the original spiritual master.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Appearance of Śrī Nārada."
