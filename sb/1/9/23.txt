===== Purport =====

//Yoga// means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject matter. And actually such concentration is //samādhi,// or cent percent engagement in the service of the Lord. And one who concentrates his attention in that manner is called a //yogī.// Such a //yogī// devotee of the Lord engages himself twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord so that his whole attention is engrossed with the thoughts of the Lord in ninefold devotional service, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, praying, becoming a voluntary servant, carrying out orders, establishing a friendly relationship, or offering all that one may possess, in the service of the Lord. By such practice of //yoga,// or linking up in the service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord Himself, as it is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā// concerning the highest perfectional stage of //samādhi.// The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst all the //yogīs// Such a perfect //yogī// is enabled by the divine grace of the Lord to concentrate his mind upon the Lord with a perfect sense of consciousness, and thus by chanting His holy name before quitting the body the //yogī// is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets where there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. In material existence a living being has to endure the material conditions of threefold miseries, life after life, according to his fruitive work. Such material life is produced by material desires only. Devotional service to the Lord does not kill the natural desires of the living being, but they are applied in the right cause of devotional service. This qualifies the desire to be transferred to the spiritual sky. General Bhīṣmadeva is referring to a particular type of //yoga// called //bhakti-yoga,// and he was fortunate enough to have the Lord directly in his presence before he quitted his material body. He therefore desired that the Lord stay before his view in the following verses.
