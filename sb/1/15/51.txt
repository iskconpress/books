===== Purport =====

//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is a narration about the Personality of Godhead and the devotees of the Lord like the Pāṇḍavas. The narration of the Personality of Godhead and His devotees is absolute in itself, and thus to hear it with a devotional attitude is to associate with the Lord and constant companions of the Lord. By the process of hearing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// one can attain the highest perfection of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead, without failure.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Pāṇḍavas Retire Timely."
