**I have just lost Him whose separation for a moment would render all the universes unfavorable and void, like bodies without life.**

===== Purport =====

Factually for a living being there is no one dearer than the Lord. The Lord expands Himself by innumerable parts and parcels as //svāṁśa// and //vibhinnāṁśa.// Paramātmā is the //svāṁśa// part of the Lord, whereas the //vibhinnāṁśa// parts are the living beings. As the living being is the important factor in the material body, for without the living being the material body has no value, similarly without Paramātmā the living being has no status quo. Similarly, Brahman or Paramātmā has no //locus standi// without the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is thoroughly explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// They are all interlinked with one another, or interdependent factors; thus in the ultimate issue the Lord is the //summum bonum// and therefore the vital principle of everything.
