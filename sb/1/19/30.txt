===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī was then surrounded by saintly sages and demigods just as the moon is surrounded by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. His presence was gorgeous, and he was respected by all.**

===== Purport =====

In the great assembly of saintly personalities, there was Vyāsadeva the //brahmarṣi,// Nārada the //devarṣi,// Paraśurāma the great ruler of the //kṣatriya// kings, etc. Some of them were powerful incarnations of the Lord. Śukadeva Gosvāmī was not known as //brahmarṣi, rājarṣi// or //devarṣi,// nor was he an incarnation like Nārada, Vyāsa or Paraśurāma. And yet he excelled them in respects paid. This means that the devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord Himself. One should therefore never minimize the importance of a devotee like Śukadeva Gosvāmī.
