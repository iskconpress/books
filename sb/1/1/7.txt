===== Purport =====

//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is a natural commentation on the //Brahma-sūtra,// or the //Bādarāyaṇi Vedānta-sūtras.// It is called natural because Vyāsadeva is author of both the //Vedānta-sūtras// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// or the essence of all Vedic literatures. Besides Vyāsadeva, there are other sages who are the authors of six different philosophical systems, namely Gautama, Kaṇāda, Kapila, Patañjali, Jaimini and Aṣṭāvakra. Theism is explained completely in the //Vedānta-sūtra,// whereas in other systems of philosophical speculations, practically no mention is given to the ultimate cause of all causes. One can sit on the //vyāsāsana// only after being conversant in all systems of philosophy so that one can present fully the theistic views of the //Bhāgavatam// in defiance of all other systems. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī was the proper teacher, and therefore the sages at Naimiṣāraṇya elevated him to the //vyāsāsana.// Śrīla Vyāsadeva is designated herein as the Personality of Godhead because he is the authorized empowered incarnation.
