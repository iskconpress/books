===== Purport =====

There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord. The //Rāmāyaṇa,// the //Mahābhārata,// and the //Purāṇas// are histories of bygone ages recorded in connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after repeated readings. For example, anyone may read //Bhagavad-gītā// or the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// repeatedly throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane news is static whereas transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or devotional activities. //Uttama-śloka// indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different. Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated persons are never satisfied by the repetition of the words //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// Such artificial realization of Brahman becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This means the Māyāvāda philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is transcendental.
