===== Purport =====

//Bhagavān// means the Almighty God who is the controller of all opulences, power, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. He is the protector of His pure devotees. Although God is equally disposed to everyone, He is especially inclined to His devotees. //Sat// means the Absolute Truth. And persons who are servitors of the Absolute Truth are called //sātvatas.// And the Personality of Godhead who protects such pure devotees is known as the protector of the //sātvatas. Bhadraṁ te,// or "blessings upon you," indicates the sages' anxiety to know the Absolute Truth from the speaker. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared to Devakī, the wife of Vasudeva. Vasudeva is the symbol of the transcendental position wherein the appearance of the Supreme Lord takes place.
