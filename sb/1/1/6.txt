===== Translation =====

**The sages said: Respected Sūta Gosvāmī, you are completely free from all vice. You are well versed in all the scriptures famous for religious life, and in the Purāṇas and the histories as well, for you have gone through them under proper guidance and have also explained them.**

===== Purport =====

A //gosvāmī,// or the bona fide representative of Śrī Vyāsadeva, must be free from all kinds of vices. The four major vices of Kali-yuga are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) animal slaughter, (3) intoxication, (4) speculative gambling of all sorts. A //gosvāmī// must be free from all these vices before he can dare sit on the //vyāsāsana.// No one should be allowed to sit on the //vyāsāsana// who is not spotless in character and who is not freed from the above-mentioned vices. He not only should be freed from all such vices, but must also be well versed in all revealed scriptures or in the //Vedas.// The //Purāṇas// are also parts of the //Vedas.// And histories like the //Mahābhārata// or //Rāmāyaṇa// are also parts of the //Vedas.// The //ācārya// or the //gosvāmī// must be well acquainted with all these literatures. To hear and explain them is more important than reading them. One can assimilate the knowledge of the revealed scriptures only by hearing and explaining. Hearing is called //śravaṇa,// and explaining is called //kīrtana.// The two processes of //śravaṇa// and //kīrtana// are of primary importance to progressive spiritual life. Only one who has properly grasped the transcendental knowledge from the right source by submissive hearing can properly explain the subject.
