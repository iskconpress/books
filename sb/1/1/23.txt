===== Purport =====

Essentially religion is the prescribed codes enunciated by the Personality of Godhead Himself. Whenever there is gross misuse or neglect of the principles of religion, the Supreme Lord appears Himself to restore religious principles. This is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:8|(4.8)]]. Here the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya are inquiring about these principles. The reply to this question is given later. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the transcendental sound representation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus it is the full representation of transcendental knowledge and religious principles.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, First Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Questions by the Sages."
