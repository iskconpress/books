===== Translation =====

**As long as Yamarāja, who causes everyone's death, is present here, no one shall meet with death. The great sages have invited the controller of death, Yamarāja, who is the representative of the Lord. Living beings who are under his grip should take advantage by hearing the deathless nectar in the form of this narration of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.**

===== Purport =====

Every human being dislikes meeting death, but he does not know how to get rid of death. The surest remedy for avoiding death is to accustom oneself to hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord as they are systematically narrated in the text of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is advised herein, therefore, that any human being who desires freedom from death should take to this course of life as recommended by the //ṛṣis// headed by Śaunaka.
