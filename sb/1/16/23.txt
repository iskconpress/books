===== Translation =====

**O mother earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, incarnated Himself as Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa just to unload your heavy burden. All His activities here are transcendental, and they cement the path of liberation. You are now bereft of His presence. You are probably now thinking of those activities and feeling sorry in their absence.**

===== Purport =====

The activities of the Lord include liberation, but they are more relishable than the pleasure derived from //nirvāṇa,// or liberation. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the word used here is //nirvāṇa-vilambitāni,// that which minimizes the value of liberation. To attain //nirvāṇa,// liberation, one has to undergo a severe type of //tapasya,// austerity, but the Lord is so merciful that He incarnates to diminish the burden of the earth. Simply by remembering such activities, one can defy the pleasure derived from //nirvāṇa// and reach the transcendental abode of the Lord to associate with Him, eternally engaged in His blissful loving service.
