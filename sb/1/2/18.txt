**By regular attendance in classes on the Bhāgavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.**

===== Purport =====

Here is the remedy for eliminating all inauspicious things within the heart which are considered to be obstacles in the path of self-realization. The remedy is the association of the //Bhāgavatas.// There are two types of //Bhāgavatas,// namely the book //Bhāgavata// and the devotee //Bhāgavata.// Both the //Bhāgavatas// are competent remedies, and both of them or either of them can be good enough to eliminate the obstacles. A devotee //Bhāgavata// is as good as the book //Bhāgavata// because the devotee //Bhāgavata// leads his life in terms of the book //Bhāgavata// and the book //Bhāgavata// is full of information about the Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees, who are also //Bhāgavatas. Bhāgavata// book and person are identical.

The devotee //Bhāgavata// is a direct representative of Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead. So by pleasing the devotee //Bhāgavata// one can receive the benefit of the book //Bhāgavata.// Human reason fails to understand how by serving the devotee //Bhāgavata// or the book //Bhāgavata// one gets gradual promotion on the path of devotion. But actually these are facts explained by Śrīla Nāradadeva, who happened to be a maidservant's son in his previous life. The maidservant was engaged in the menial service of the sages, and thus he also came into contact with them. And simply by associating with them and accepting the remnants of foodstuff left by the sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great devotee and personality Śrīla Nāradadeva. These are the miraculous effects of the association of //Bhāgavatas.// And to understand these effects practically, it should be noted that by such sincere association of the //Bhāgavatas// one is sure to receive transcendental knowledge very easily, with the result that he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. The more progress is made in devotional service under the guidance of the //Bhāgavatas,// the more one becomes fixed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The messages of the book //Bhāgavata,// therefore, have to be received from the devotee //Bhāgavata,// and the combination of these two //Bhāgavatas// will help the neophyte devotee to make progress on and on.
