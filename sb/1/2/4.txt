===== Purport =====

All the Vedic literatures and the //Purāṇas// are meant for conquering the darkest region of material existence. The living being is in the state of forgetfulness of his relation with God due to his being overly attracted to material sense gratification from time immemorial. His struggle for existence in the material world is perpetual, and it is not possible for him to get out of it by making plans. If he at all wants to conquer this perpetual struggle for existence, he must reestablish his eternal relation with God. And one who wants to adopt such remedial measures must take shelter of literatures such as the //Vedas// and the //Purāṇas.// Foolish people say that the //Purāṇas// have no connection with the //Vedas.// However, the //Purāṇas// are supplementary explanations of the //Vedas// intended for different types of men. All men are not equal. There are men who are conducted by the mode of goodness, others who are under the mode of passion and others who are under the mode of ignorance. The //Purāṇas// are so divided that any class of men can take advantage of them and gradually regain their lost position and get out of the hard struggle for existence. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī shows the way of chanting the //Purāṇas.// This may be followed by persons who aspire to be preachers of the Vedic literatures and the //Purāṇas. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the spotless //Purāṇa,// and it is especially meant for those who desire to get out of the material entanglement permanently.
