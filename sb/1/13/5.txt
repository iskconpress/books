===== Translation =====

**With great delight they all approached him, as if life had returned to their bodies. They exchanged obeisances and welcomed each other with embraces.**

===== Purport =====

In the absence of consciousness, the limbs of the body remain inactive. But when consciousness returns, the limbs and senses become active, and existence itself becomes delightful. Vidura was so dear to the members of the Kaurava family that his long absence from the palace was comparable to inactivity. All of them were feeling acute separation from Vidura, and therefore his return to the palace was joyful for all.
