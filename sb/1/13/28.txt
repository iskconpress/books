===== Purport =====

One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a //dhīra,// or leaving home for good without communicating with relatives, and Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay because very quickly the age of Kali was approaching. A conditioned soul is already degraded by the material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest standard. He was advised to leave home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of the age which was fast approaching. To become //narottama,// or a first-class human being depending completely on the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is not possible for any ordinary man. It is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:28|(Bg. 7.28)]] that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was advised by Vidura at least to become a //dhīra// in the beginning if it were impossible for him to become a //sannyāsī// or a //narottama.// Persistently endeavoring on the line of self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a //narottama// from the stage of a //dhīra.// The //dhīra// stage is attained after prolonged practice of the //yoga// system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the means of the //dhīra// stage, which is the preparatory stage for //sannyāsa.// The //sannyāsa// stage is the preparatory stage of //paramahaṁsa,// or the first-grade devotee of the Lord.
