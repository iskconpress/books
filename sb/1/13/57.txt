===== Purport =====

Nārada Muni's prophecy prohibited Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja from going to the place where his uncle was staying because even after quitting the body by his own mystic power, Dhṛtarāṣṭra would not be in need of any funeral ceremony; Nārada Muni indicated that his body by itself would burn to ashes. The perfection of the //yoga// system is attained by such mystic power. The //yogī// is able to quit his body by his own choice of time and can attain any planet he desires by turning the present body into ashes by self-made fire.
