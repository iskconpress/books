===== Translation =====

**Thus please narrate to us the narrations of the Unlimited, for they are purifying and supreme. They were spoken to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, and they are very dear to the pure devotees, being full of bhakti-yoga.**

===== Purport =====

What was spoken to Mahārāja Parīkṣit and what is very dear to the pure devotees is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is mainly full of the narrations of the activities of the Supreme Unlimited, and therefore it is the science of //bhakti-yoga,// or the devotional service of the Lord. Thus it is //para,// or supreme, because although it is enriched with all knowledge and religion, it is specifically enriched with the devotional service of the Lord.
