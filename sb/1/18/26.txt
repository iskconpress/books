===== Purport =====

It appears that the //muni,// in whose hermitage the King entered, was in yogic trance. The transcendental position is attained by three processes, namely the process of //jñāna,// or theoretical knowledge of transcendence, the process of //yoga,// or factual realization of trance by manipulation of the physiological and psychological functions of the body, and the most approved process of //bhakti-yoga,// or the engagement of senses in the devotional service of the Lord. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also we have the information of the gradual development of perception from matter to a living entity. Our material mind and body develop from the living entity, the soul, and being influenced by the three qualities of matter, we forget our real identity. The //jñāna// process theoretically speculates about the reality of the soul. But //bhakti-yoga// factually engages the spirit soul in activities. The perception of matter is transcended to still subtler states of the senses. The senses are transcended to the subtler mind, and then to breathing activities and gradually to intelligence. Beyond the intelligence, the living soul is realized by the mechanical activities of the //yoga// system, or practice of meditation restraining the senses, regulating the breathing system and applying intelligence to rise to the transcendental position. This trance stops all material activities of the body. The King saw the //muni// in that position. He also saw the //muni// as follows.
