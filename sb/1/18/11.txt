===== Purport =====

When we hear about the transcendental qualities and activities of the Personality of Godhead, we may always remember what has been spoken by the Lord Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]. His acts, even when He acts in human society, are all transcendental, for they are all accentuated by the spiritual energy of the Lord, which is distinguished from His material energy. As stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// such acts are called //divyam.// This means that He does not act or take His birth like an ordinary living being under the custody of material energy. Nor is His body material or changeable like that of ordinary living beings. And one who understands this fact, either from the Lord or from authorized sources, is not reborn after leaving the present material body. Such an enlightened soul is admitted into the spiritual realm of the Lord and engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Therefore, the more we hear about the transcendental activities of the Lord, as they are stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the more we can know about His transcendental nature and thus make definite progress on the path back to Godhead.
