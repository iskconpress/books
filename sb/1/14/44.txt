===== Purport =====

All the inquisitiveness of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira about the world situation was already conjectured by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira on the basis of Lord Kṛṣṇa's disappearance from the vision of the world, and this was now disclosed by him because of the acute dejection of Arjuna, which could not have been possible otherwise. So even though he was doubtful about it, he was obliged to inquire frankly from Arjuna on the basis of Śrī Nārada's indication.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Disappearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa."
