===== Translation =====

**You are always the protector of the deserving living beings, such as brāhmaṇas, children, cows, women and the diseased. Could you not give them protection when they approached you for shelter?**

===== Purport =====

The //brāhmaṇas,// who are always engaged in researching knowledge for the society's welfare work, both materially and spiritually, deserve the protection of the king in all respects. Similarly, the children of the state, the cow, the diseased person, the woman and the old man specifically require the protection of the state or a //kṣatriya// king. If such living beings do not get protection by the //kṣatriya,// or the royal order, or by the state, it is certainly shameful for the //kṣatriya// or the state. If such things had actually happened to Arjuna, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious to know about these discrepancies.
