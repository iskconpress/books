===== Translation =====

**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa then prepared for His departure. He invited the sons of Pāṇḍu, after having been worshiped by the brāhmaṇas, headed by Śrīla Vyāsadeva. The Lord also reciprocated greetings.**

===== Purport =====

Apparently Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was a //kṣatriya// and was not worshipable by the //brāhmaṇas.// But the //brāhmaṇas// present there, headed by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, all knew Him to be the Personality of Godhead, and therefore they worshiped Him. The Lord reciprocated the greetings just to honor the social order that a //kṣatriya// is obedient to the orders of the //brāhmaṇas.// Although Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was always offered the respects due the Supreme Lord from all responsible quarters, the Lord never deviated from the customary usages between the four orders of society. The Lord purposely observed all these social customs so that others would follow Him in the future.
