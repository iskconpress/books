===== Translation =====

**Others say that since both Vasudeva and Devakī prayed for You, You have taken Your birth as their son. Undoubtedly You are unborn, yet You take Your birth for their welfare and to kill those who are envious of the demigods.**

===== Purport =====

It is also said that Vasudeva and Devakī, in their previous birth as Sutapā and Pṛśni, underwent a severe type of penance to get the Lord as their son, and as a result of such austerities the Lord appeared as their son. It is already declared in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that the Lord appears for the welfare of all people of the world and to vanquish the //asuras,// or the materialistic atheists.
