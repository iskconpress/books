===== Translation =====

**O foremost among the great thinkers [munis] [Śaunaka], seeing the glaring brahmāstra proceeding towards them, the Pāṇḍavas took up their five respective weapons.**

===== Purport =====

The //brahmāstras// are finer than the nuclear weapons. Aśvatthāmā discharged the //brahmāstra// simply to kill the Pāṇḍavas, namely the five brothers headed by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and their only grandson, who was lying within the womb of Uttarā. Therefore the //brahmāstra,// more effective and finer than the atomic weapons, was not as blind as the atomic bombs. When the atomic bombs are discharged they do not discriminate between the target and others. Mainly the atomic bombs do harm to the innocent because there is no control. The //brahmāstra// is not like that. It marks out the target and proceeds accordingly without harming the innocent.
