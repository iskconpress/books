===== Translation =====

**When the personality of Kali understood that the King was willing to kill him, he at once abandoned the dress of a king and, under pressure of fear, completely surrendered to him, bowing his head.**

===== Purport =====

The royal dress of the personality of Kali is artificial. The royal dress is suitable for a king or //kṣatriya,// but when a lower-class man artificially dresses himself as a king, his real identity is disclosed by the challenge of a bona fide //kṣatriya// like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. A real //kṣatriya// never surrenders. He accepts the challenge of his rival //kṣatriya,// and he fights either to die or to win. Surrender is unknown to a real //kṣatriya.// In the age of Kali there are so many pretenders dressed and posed like administrators or executive heads, but their real identity is disclosed when they are challenged by a real //kṣatriya.// Therefore when the artificially dressed personality of Kali saw that to fight Mahārāja Parīkṣit was beyond his ability, he bowed down his head like a subordinate and gave up his royal dress.
