**Sūta Gosvāmī said: After reaching that place, Mahārāja Parīkṣit observed that a lower-caste śūdra, dressed like a king, was beating a cow and a bull with a club, as if they had no owner.**

===== Purport =====

The principal sign of the age of Kali is that lower-caste //śūdras,// i.e., men without brahminical culture and spiritual initiation, will be dressed like administrators or kings, and the principal business of such non-//kṣatriya// rulers will be to kill the innocent animals, especially the cows and the bulls, who shall be unprotected by their masters, the bona fide //vaiśyas,// the mercantile community. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:44|(Bg. 18.44)]], it is said that the //vaiśyas// are meant to deal in agriculture, cow protection and trade. In the age of Kali, the degraded //vaiśyas,// the mercantile men, are engaged in supplying cows to slaughterhouses. The //kṣatriyas// are meant to protect the citizens of the state, whereas the //vaiśyas// are meant to protect the cows and bulls and utilize them to produce grains and milk. The cow is meant to deliver milk, and the bull is meant to produce grains. But in the age of Kali, the //śūdra// class of men are in the posts of administrators, and the cows and bulls, or the mothers and the fathers, unprotected by the //vaiśyas,// are subjected to the slaughterhouses organized by the //śūdra// administrators.
