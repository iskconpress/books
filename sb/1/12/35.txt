**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, being invited to the sacrifices by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, saw to it that they were performed by qualified [twice-born] brāhmaṇas. After that, for the pleasure of the relatives, the Lord remained a few months.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was invited by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to look into the supervision of the performances of //yajña,// and the Lord, to abide by the orders of His elderly cousin, caused the performance of //yajñas// by learned twice-born //brāhmaṇas.// Simply taking birth in the family of a //brāhmaṇa// does not make one qualified to perform //yajñas.// One must be twice-born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide //ācārya.// The once-born scions of //brāhmaṇa// families are equal with the once-born //śūdras,// and such //brahma-bandhus,// or unqualified once-born scions, must be rejected for any purpose of religious or Vedic function. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was entrusted to look after this arrangement, and perfect as He is, He caused the //yajñas// to be performed by the bona fide twice-born //brāhmaṇas// for successful execution.
