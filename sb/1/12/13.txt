===== Purport =====

There is a need for a good and intelligent class of //brāhmaṇas// who are expert in performing the purificatory processes prescribed in the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Unless such purificatory processes are performed, there is no possibility of good population, and in the age of Kali the population all over the world is of //śūdra// quality or lower for want of this purificatory process. It is not possible, however, to revive the Vedic process of purification in this age, for want of proper facilities and good //brāhmaṇas,// but there is the //Pāñcarātrika// system also recommended for this age. The //Pāñcarātrika// system acts on the //śūdra// class of men, supposedly the population of the Kali-yuga, and it is the prescribed purificatory process suitable to the age and time. Such a purificatory process is allowed only for spiritual upliftment and not for any other purpose. Spiritual upliftment is never conditioned by higher or lower parentage.

After the //garbhādhāna// purificatory process, there are certain other //saṁskāras// like //sīmantonnayana, sadhabhakṣaṇam,// etc., during the period of pregnancy, and when the child is born the first purificatory process is //jātakarman.// This was performed duly by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira with the help of good and learned //brāhmaṇas// like Dhaumya, the royal priest, and Kṛpācārya, who was not only a priest but also a great general. Both these learned and perfect priests, assisted by other good //brāhmaṇas,// were employed by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to perform the ceremony. Therefore all the //saṁskāras,// purificatory processes, are not mere formalities or social functions only, but they are all for practical purposes and can be successfully performed by expert //brāhmaṇas// like Dhaumya and Kṛpa. Such //brāhmaṇas// are not only rare, but also not available in this age, and therefore, for the purpose of spiritual upliftment in this fallen age, the Gosvāmīs prefer the purificatory processes under //Pāñcarātrika// formulas to the Vedic rites.

Kṛpācārya is the son of the great Ṛṣi Sardban and was born in the family of Gautama. The birth is said to be accidental. By chance, the great Ṛṣi Sardban met Janapadī, a famous society girl of heaven, and the Ṛṣi Sardban discharged semina in two parts. By one part immediately a male child and by the other part a female child were born as twins. The male child was later on known as Kṛpa, and the female child was known as Kṛpī. Mahārāja Śantanu, while engaged in chase in the jungle, picked up the children and brought them up to the brahminical status by the proper purificatory process. Kṛpācārya later became a great general like Droṇācārya, and his sister was married to Droṇācārya. Kṛpācārya later on took part in the Battle of Kurukṣetra and joined the party of Duryodhana. Kṛpācārya helped kill Abhimanyu, the father of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, but he was still held in esteem by the family of the Pāṇḍavas due to his being as great a //brāhmaṇa// as Droṇācārya. When the Pāṇḍavas were sent to the forest after being defeated in the gambling game with Duryodhana, Dhṛtarāṣṭra entrusted the Pāṇḍavas to Kṛpācārya for guidance. After the end of the battle, Kṛpācārya again became a member of the royal assembly, and he was called during the birth of Mahārāja Parīkṣit for recitation of auspicious Vedic hymns to make the ceremony successful. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, while quitting the palace for his great departure to the Himalayas, entrusted Kṛpācārya with Mahārāja Parīkṣit as his disciple, and he left home satisfied because of Kṛpācārya's taking charge of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The great administrators, kings and emperors were always under the guidance of learned //brāhmaṇas// like Kṛpācārya and thus were able to act properly in the discharge of political responsibilities.
