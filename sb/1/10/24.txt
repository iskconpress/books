===== Purport =====

As it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// all the Vedic literatures are glorifying the greatness of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Here it is confirmed in the //Bhāgavatam// also. The //Vedas// are expanded by many branches and subbranches by great devotees and empowered incarnations of the Lord like Vyāsa, Nārada, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the Kumāras, Kapila, Prahlāda, Janaka, Bali and Yamarāja, but in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// especially, the confidential parts of His activities are described by the confidential devotee Śukadeva Gosvāmī. In the //Vedānta-sūtras// or //Upaniṣads// there is only a hint of the confidential parts of His pastimes. In such Vedic literatures as the //Upaniṣads,// the Lord has expressively been distinguished from the mundane conception of His existence. His identity being fully spiritual, His form, name, quality, and paraphernalia, etc., have been elaborately distinguished from matter, and therefore He is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent persons as impersonal. But factually He is the Supreme Person, Bhagavān, and He is partially represented as Paramātmā or impersonal Brahman.
