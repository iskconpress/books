**O learned brāhmaṇas, when Śukadeva Gosvāmī recited Bhāgavatam there [in the presence of Emperor Parīkṣit], I heard him with rapt attention, and thus, by his mercy, I learned the Bhāgavatam from that great and powerful sage.

===== Purport =====

One can certainly see directly the presence of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the pages of //Bhāgavatam// if one has heard it from a self-realized great soul like Śukadeva Gosvāmī. One cannot, however, learn //Bhāgavatam// from a bogus hired reciter whose aim of life is to earn some money out of such recitation and employ the earning in sex indulgence. No one can learn //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// who is associated with persons engaged in sex life. That is the secret of learning //Bhāgavatam// Nor can one learn //Bhāgavatam// from one who interprets the text by his mundane scholarship. One has to learn //Bhāgavatam// from the representative of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and no one else, if one at all wants to see Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the pages. That is the process, and there is no alternative. Sūta Gosvāmī is a bona fide representative of Śukadeva Gosvāmī because he wants to present the message which he received from the great learned //brāhmaṇa.// Śukadeva Gosvāmī presented //Bhāgavatam// as he heard it from his great father, and so also Sūta Gosvāmī is presenting //Bhāgavatam// as he had heard it from Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Simple hearing is not all; one must realize the text with proper attention. The word //niviṣṭa// means that Sūta Gosvāmī drank the juice of //Bhāgavatam// through his ears. That is the real process of receiving //Bhāgavatam.// One should hear with rapt attention from the real person, and then he can at once realize the presence of Lord Kṛṣṇa in every page. The secret of knowing //Bhāgavatam// is mentioned here. No one can give rapt attention who is not pure in mind. No one can be pure in mind who is not pure in action. No one can be pure in action who is not pure in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. But somehow or other if someone hears with rapt attention from the right person, at the very beginning one can assuredly see Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in person in the pages of //Bhāgavatam.//

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Third Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Kṛṣṇa Is the Source of All Incarnations."
