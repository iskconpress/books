===== Purport =====

Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu declared that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the spotless sound representation of all Vedic knowledge and history. There are selected histories of great devotees who are in direct contact with the Personality of Godhead. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the literary incarnation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and is therefore nondifferent from Him. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// should be worshiped as respectfully as we worship the Lord. Thereby we can derive the ultimate blessings of the Lord through its careful and patient study. As God is all light, all bliss and all perfection, so also is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// We can have all the transcendental light of the Supreme Brahman, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, from the recitation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// provided it is received through the medium of the transparent spiritual master. Lord Caitanya's private secretary Śrīla Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī advised all intending visitors who came to see the Lord at Purī to make a study of the //Bhāgavatam// from the person //Bhāgavatam.// Person //Bhāgavatam// is the self-realized bona fide spiritual master, and through him only can one understand the lessons of //Bhāgavatam// in order to receive the desired result. One can derive from the study of the //Bhāgavatam// all benefits that are possible to be derived from the personal presence of the Lord. It carries with it all the transcendental blessings of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa that we can expect from His personal contact.
