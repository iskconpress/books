===== Purport =====

The //kṣatriyas,// or the administrative class of men, are expected to rule the planet by the direction of the intelligent class of men, who give direction to the rulers in terms of the standard //śāstras,// or the books of revealed knowledge. The rulers carry on the administration according to that direction. Whenever there is disobedience on the part of the //kṣatriyas,// or the administrative class, against the orders of the learned and intelligent //brāhmaṇas,// the administrators are removed by force from the posts, and arrangement is made for better administration.
