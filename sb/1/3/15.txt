===== Purport =====

According to Śrīpāda Śrīdhara Svāmī, the original commentator on the //Bhāgavatam,// there is not always a devastation after the change of every Manu. And yet this inundation after the period of Cākṣuṣa Manu took place in order to show some wonders to Satyavrata. But Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī has given definite proofs from authoritative scriptures (like //Viṣṇu-dharmottara, Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa, Harivaṁśa,// etc.) that there is always a devastation after the end of each and every Manu. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has also supported Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, and he (Śrī Cakravartī) has also quoted from //Bhāgavatāmṛta// about this inundation after each Manu. Apart from this, the Lord, in order to show special favor to Satyavrata, a devotee of the Lord, in this particular period, incarnated Himself.
