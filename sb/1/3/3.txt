===== Purport =====

The conception of the //virāṭ-rūpa// or //viśva-rūpa// of the Supreme Absolute Truth is especially meant for the neophyte who can hardly think of the transcendental form of the Personality of Godhead. To him a form means something of this material world, and therefore an opposite conception of the Absolute is necessary in the beginning to concentrate the mind on the power extension of the Lord. As stated above, the Lord extends His potency in the form of the //mahat-tattva,// which includes all material ingredients. The extension of power by the Lord and the Lord Himself personally are one in one sense, but at the same time the //mahat-tattva// is different from the Lord. Therefore the potency of the Lord and the Lord are simultaneously different and nondifferent. The conception of the //virāṭ-rūpa,// especially for the impersonalist, is thus nondifferent from the eternal form of the Lord. This eternal form of the Lord exists prior to the creation of the //mahat-tattva,// and it is stressed here that the eternal form of the Lord is par excellence spiritual or transcendental to the modes of material nature. The very same transcendental form of the Lord is manifested by His internal potency, and the formation of His multifarious manifestations of incarnations is always of the same transcendental quality, without any touch of the //mahat-tattva.//
