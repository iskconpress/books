Here is another foretelling of the advent of Lord Kalki, the incarnation of Godhead. He is to appear at the conjunction of the two //yugas,// namely at the end of Kali-yuga and the beginning of Satya-yuga. The cycle of the four //yugas,// namely Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, rotates like the calendar months. The present Kali-yuga lasts 432,000 years, out of which we have passed only 5,000 years after the Battle of Kurukṣetra and the end of the regime of King Parīkṣit. So there are 427,000 years balance yet to be finished. Therefore at the end of this period, the incarnation of Kalki will take place, as foretold in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The name of His father, Viṣṇu Yaśā, a learned //brāhmaṇa,// and the village Śambhala are also mentioned. As above mentioned, all these foretellings will prove to be factual in chronological order. That is the authority of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//
