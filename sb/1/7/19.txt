===== Translation =====

**When the son of the brāhmaṇa [Aśvatthāmā] saw that his horses were tired, he considered that there was no alternative for protection outside of his using the ultimate weapon, the brahmāstra [nuclear weapon].**

===== Purport =====

In the ultimate issue only, when there is no alternative, the nuclear weapon called the //brahmāstra// is applied. The word //dvijātmajaḥ// is significant here because Aśvatthāmā, although the son of Droṇācārya, was not exactly a qualified //brāhmaṇa.// The most intelligent man is called a //brāhmaṇa,// and it is not a hereditary title. Aśvatthāmā was also formerly called the //brahma-bandhu,// or the friend of a //brāhmaṇa.// Being a friend of a //brāhmaṇa// does not mean that one is a //brāhmaṇa// by qualification. A friend or son of a //brāhmaṇa,// when fully qualified, can be called a //brāhmaṇa// and not otherwise. Since Aśvatthāmā's decision is immature, he is purposely called herein the son of a //brāhmaṇa.//
