===== Translation =====

**Śrī Sūta said: On the western bank of the River Sarasvatī, which is intimately related with the Vedas, there is a cottage for meditation at Śamyāprāsa which enlivens the transcendental activities of the sages.**

===== Purport =====

For spiritual advancement of knowledge a suitable place and atmosphere are definitely required. The place on the western bank of the Sarasvatī is especially suitable for this purpose. And there is the //āśrama// of Vyāsadeva at Śamyāprāsa. Śrīla Vyāsadeva was a householder, yet his residential place is called an //āśrama.// An //āśrama// is a place where spiritual culture is always foremost. It does not matter whether the place belongs to a householder or a mendicant. The whole //varṇāśrama// system is so designed that each and every status of life is called an //āśrama.// This means that spiritual culture is the common factor for all. The //brahmacārīs,// the //gṛhasthas,// the //vānaprasthas// and the //sannyāsīs// all belong to the same mission of life, namely, realization of the Supreme. Therefore none of them are less important as far as spiritual culture is concerned. The difference is a matter of formality on the strength of renunciation. The //sannyāsīs// are held in high estimation on the strength of practical renunciation.
