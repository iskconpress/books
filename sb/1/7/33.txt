===== Translation =====

**Arjuna, his eyes blazing in anger like two red balls of copper, dexterously arrested the son of Gautamī and bound him with ropes like an animal.**

===== Purport =====

Aśvatthāmā's mother, Kṛpī, was born in the family of Gautama. The significant point in this //śloka// is that Aśvatthāmā was caught and bound up with ropes like an animal. According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, Arjuna was obliged to catch this son of a //brāhmaṇa// like an animal as a part of his duty (//dharma//). This suggestion by Śrīdhara Svāmī is also confirmed in the later statement of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Aśvatthāmā was a bona fide son of Droṇācārya and Kṛpī, but because he had degraded himself to a lower status of life, it was proper to treat him as an animal and not as a //brāhmaṇa.//
