===== Purport =====

In this chapter the clue for describing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is picked up as Mahārāja Parīkṣit is miraculously saved in the womb of his mother. This was caused by Drauṇi (Aśvatthāmā), Ācārya Droṇa's son, who killed the five sons of Draupadī while they were asleep, for which he was punished by Arjuna. Before commencing the great epic //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Śrī Vyāsadeva realized the whole truth by trance in devotion.
