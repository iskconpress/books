===== Translation =====

**O gentle lady, when I present you with the head of that brāhmaṇa, after beheading him with arrows from my Gāṇḍīva bow, I shall then wipe the tears from your eyes and pacify you. Then, after burning your sons' bodies, you can take your bath standing on his head.**

===== Purport =====

An enemy who sets fire to the house, administers poison, attacks all of a sudden with deadly weapons, plunders wealth or usurps agricultural fields, or entices one's wife is called an aggressor. Such an aggressor, though he be a //brāhmaṇa// or a so-called son of a //brāhmaṇa,// has to be punished in all circumstances. When Arjuna promised to behead the aggressor named Aśvatthāmā, he knew well that Aśvatthāmā was the son of a //brāhmaṇa,// but because the so-called //brāhmaṇa// acted like a butcher, he was taken as such, and there was no question of sin in killing such a //brāhmaṇa's// son who proved to be a villain.
