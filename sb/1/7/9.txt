===== Translation =====

**Śrī Śaunaka asked Sūta Gosvāmī: Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī was already on the path of self-realization, and thus he was pleased with his own self. So why did he take the trouble to undergo the study of such a vast literature?**

===== Purport =====

For the people in general the highest perfection of life is to cease from material activities and be fixed on the path of self-realization. Those who take pleasure in sense enjoyment, or those who are fixed in material bodily welfare work, are called //karmīs.// Out of thousands and millions of such //karmīs,// one may become an //ātmārāma// by self-realization. //Ātmā// means self, and //ārāma// means to take pleasure. Everyone is searching after the highest pleasure, but the standard of pleasure of one may be different from the standard of another. Therefore, the standard of pleasure enjoyed by the //karmīs// is different from that of the //ātmārāmas.// The //ātmārāmas// are completely indifferent to material enjoyment in every respect. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī had already attained that stage, and still he was attracted to undergo the trouble of studying the great //Bhāgavatam// literature. This means that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is a postgraduate study even for the //ātmārāmas,// who have surpassed all the studies of Vedic knowledge.
