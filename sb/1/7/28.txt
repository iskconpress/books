**O Arjuna, only another brahmāstra can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon.**

===== Purport =====

For the atomic bombs there is no counterweapon to neutralize the effects. But by subtle science the action of a //brahmāstra// can be counteracted, and those who were expert in the military science in those days could counteract the //brahmāstra.// The son of Droṇācārya did not know the art of counteracting the weapon, and therefore Arjuna was asked to counteract it by the power of his own weapon.
