===== Translation =====

**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: O Arjuna, you should not show mercy by releasing this relative of a brāhmaṇa [brahma-bandhu], for he has killed innocent boys in their sleep.**

===== Purport =====

The word //brahma-bandhu// is significant. A person who happens to take birth in the family of a //brāhmaṇa// but is not qualified to be called a //brāhmaṇa// is addressed as the relative of a //brāhmaṇa,// and not as a //brāhmaṇa.// The son of a high-court judge is not virtually a high-court judge, but there is no harm in addressing a high-court judge's son as a relative of the Honorable Justice. Therefore, as by birth only one does not become a high-court judge, so also one does not become a //brāhmaṇa// simply by birthright but by acquiring the necessary qualifications of a //brāhmaṇa.// As the high-court judgeship is a post for the qualified man, so also the post of a //brāhmaṇa// is attainable by qualification only. The //śāstra// enjoins that even if good qualifications are seen in a person born in a family other than that of a //brāhmaṇa,// the qualified man has to be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa,// and similarly if a person born in the family of a //brāhmaṇa// is void of brahminical qualification, then he must be treated as a non-//brāhmaṇa// or, in better terms, a relative of a //brāhmaṇa.// Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority of all religious principles, the //Vedas,// has personally pointed out these differences, and He is about to explain the reason for this in the following //ślokas.//
