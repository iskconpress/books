===== Translation =====

**When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, were killed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell down lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhīmasena, the son of Droṇācārya [Aśvatthāmā] beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadī and delivered them as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased in the least.**

===== Purport =====

Transcendental topics of the activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// begin from the end of the battle at Kurukṣetra, where the Lord Himself spoke about Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore, both the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are transcendental topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The //Gītā// is //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or topics of Kṛṣṇa, because it is spoken by the Lord, and the //Bhāgavatam// is also //kṛṣṇa-kathā// because it is spoken about the Lord. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted everyone to be informed of both //kṛṣṇa-kathās// by His order. Lord Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is Kṛṣṇa Himself in the garb of a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore the versions of both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu are identical. //Lord Caitanya desired that all who are born in India seriously understand such kṛṣṇa-kathās// and then after full realization preach the transcendental message to everyone in all parts of the world. That will bring about the desired peace and prosperity of the stricken world.
