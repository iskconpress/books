**The great sage Vyāsadeva, after compiling the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and revising it, taught it to his own son, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who was already engaged in self-realization.**

===== Purport =====

//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the natural commentation on the //Brahma-sūtras// compiled by the same author. This //Brahma-sūtra,// or //Vedānta-sūtra,// is meant for those who are already engaged in self-realization. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is so made that one becomes at once engaged in the path of self-realization simply by hearing the topics. Although it is especially meant for the //paramahaṁsas,// or those who are totally engaged in self-realization, it works into the depths of the hearts of those who may be worldly men. Worldly men are all engaged in sense gratification. But even such men will find in this Vedic literature a remedial measure for their material diseases. Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a liberated soul from the very beginning of his birth, and his father taught him //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Amongst mundane scholars, there is some diversity of opinion as to the date of compilation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is, however, certain from the text of the //Bhāgavatam// that it was compiled before the disappearance of King Parīkṣit and after the departure of Lord Kṛṣṇa. When Mahārāja Parīkṣit was ruling the world as the King of Bhārata-varṣa, he chastised the personality of Kali. According to revealed scriptures and astrological calculation, the age of Kali is in its five thousandth year. Therefore, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was compiled not less than five thousand years ago. //Mahābhārata// was compiled before //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and the //Purāṇas// were compiled before //Mahābhārata.// That is an estimation of the date of compilation of the different Vedic literatures. The synopsis of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was given before the detailed description under instruction of Nārada. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the science for following the path of //nivṛtti-mārga.// The path of //pravṛtti-mārga// was condemned by Nārada. That path is the natural inclination for all conditioned souls. The theme of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the cure of the materialistic disease of the human being, or stopping completely the pangs of material existence.
