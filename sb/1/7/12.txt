===== Purport =====

Lord Kṛṣṇa is so kind to the fallen souls that He personally incarnates Himself amongst the different kinds of living entities and takes part with them in daily activities. Any historical fact old or new which has a connection with the activities of the Lord is to be understood as a transcendental narration of the Lord. Without Kṛṣṇa, all the supplementary literatures like the //Purāṇas// and //Mahābhārata// are simply stories or historical facts. But with Kṛṣṇa they become transcendental, and when we hear of them we at once become transcendentally related with the Lord. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is also a //Purāṇa,// but the special significance of this //Purāṇa// is that the activities of the Lord are central and not just supplementary historical facts. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is thus recommended by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the spotless //Purāṇa.// There is a class of less intelligent devotees of the //Bhāgavata Purāṇa// who desire to relish at once the activities of the Lord narrated in the Tenth Canto without first understanding the primary cantos. They are under the false impression that the other cantos are not concerned with Kṛṣṇa, and thus more foolishly than intelligently they take to the reading of the Tenth Canto. These readers are specifically told herein that the other cantos of the //Bhāgavatam// are as important as the Tenth Canto. No one should try to go into the matters of the Tenth Canto without having thoroughly understood the purport of the other nine cantos. Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees like the Pāṇḍavas are on the same plane. Kṛṣṇa is not without His devotees of all the //rasas,// and the pure devotees like the Pāṇḍavas are not without Kṛṣṇa. The devotees and the Lord are interlinked, and they cannot be separated. Therefore talks about them are all //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or topics of the Lord.
