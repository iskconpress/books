===== Translation =====

**I took this as the special mercy of the Lord, who always desires benediction for His devotees, and so thinking, I started for the north.**

===== Purport =====

Confidential devotees of the Lord see in every step a benedictory direction of the Lord. What is considered to be an odd or difficult moment in the mundane sense is accepted as special mercy of the Lord. Mundane prosperity is a kind of material fever, and by the grace of the Lord the temperature of this material fever is gradually diminished, and spiritual health is obtained step by step. Mundane people misunderstand it.
