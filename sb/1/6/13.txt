===== Purport =====

It is the duty of a mendicant (//parivrājakācārya//) to experience all varieties of God's creation by traveling alone through all forests, hills, towns, villages, etc., to gain faith in God and strength of mind as well as to enlighten the inhabitants with the message of God. A //sannyāsī// is duty-bound to take all these risks without fear, and the most typical //sannyāsī// of the present age is Lord Caitanya, who traveled in the same manner through the central Indian jungles, enlightening even the tigers, bears, snakes, deer, elephants and many other jungle animals. In this age of Kali, //sannyāsa// is forbidden for ordinary men. One who changes his dress to make propaganda is a different man from the original ideal //sannyāsī.// One should, however, take the vow to stop social intercourse completely and devote life exclusively to the service of the Lord. The change of dress is only a formality. Lord Caitanya did not accept the name of a //sannyāsī,// and in this age of Kali the so-called //sannyāsīs// should not change their former names, following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya. In this age, devotional service of hearing and repeating the holy glories of the Lord is strongly recommended, and one who takes the vow of renunciation of family life need not imitate the //parivrājakācārya// like Nārada or Lord Caitanya, but may sit down at some holy place and devote his whole time and energy to hear and repeatedly chant the holy scriptures left by the great //ācāryas// like the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana.
