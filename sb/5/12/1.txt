**King Rahūgaṇa said: O most exalted personality, you are not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

===== Purport =====

From the //Brahma-saṁhitā// we understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes (//sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]). Ṛṣabhadeva was the direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. His son, Bharata Mahārāja, who was now acting as the //brāhmaṇa// Jaḍa Bharata, had received his body from the cause of all causes. Therefore he is addressed as //kāraṇa-vigrahāya.//
