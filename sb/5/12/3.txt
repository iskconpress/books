===== Purport =====

The Vedic literature instructs: //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. An intelligent man must be very inquisitive to know the transcendental science deeply. Therefore one must approach a //guru,// a spiritual master. Although Jaḍa Bharata explained everything to Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa, it appears that his intelligence was not perfect enough to understand clearly. He therefore requested a further explanation. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]]: //tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā.// The student must approach a spiritual master and surrender unto him fully (//praṇipātena//). He must also question him in order to understand his instructions (//paripraśnena//). One should not only surrender to the spiritual master but also render loving service unto him (//sevayā//) so that the spiritual master will be pleased with the student and explain the transcendental subject matter more clearly. A challenging spirit before the spiritual master should be avoided if one is at all interested in learning the Vedic instructions in depth.
