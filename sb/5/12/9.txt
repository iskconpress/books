The earth was originally created by a combination of atomic particles, but these particles are impermanent. Actually the atom is not the cause of the universe, although some philosophers think so.

===== Translation =====

**One may say that varieties arise from the planet earth itself. However, although the universe may temporarily appear to be the truth, it ultimately has no real existence. The earth was originally created by a combination of atomic particles, but these particles are impermanent. Actually the atom is not the cause of the universe, although some philosophers think so. It is not a fact that the varieties found in this material world simply result from atomic juxtaposition or combination.**

===== Purport =====

Those who follow the atomic theory think that the protons and electrons of atoms combine in such a way as to bring all material existence into being. However, the scientists fail to discover the cause of atomic existence itself. Under these circumstances, we cannot accept that the atom is the cause of the universe. Such theories are advanced by unintelligent people. According to real intelligence, the real cause of the cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Lord. //Janmādy asya yataḥ:// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]] He is the original cause of all creation. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]]: //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.// Kṛṣṇa is the original cause. //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam:// [Bs. 5.1] He is the cause of all causes. Kṛṣṇa is the cause of atoms, the material energy.

The ultimate cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and only those in ignorance try to find out other causes by posing different theories.
