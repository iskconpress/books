**After Kavi, Mahāvīra and Savana were completely trained in the paramahaṁsa stage of life, Mahārāja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He greatly loved his wife Barhiṣmatī, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also increased.

===== Purport =====

In this verse, the word //dharma-pratipakṣaḥ// ("opponents of religious principles") refers not to a particular faith, but to //varṇāśrama-dharma,// the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four //varṇas// (//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//) and four //āśramas// (//brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa//). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of life---namely spiritual understanding---the principles of //varṇāśrama-dharma// must be accepted. From this verse, Mahārāja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of //varṇāśrama-dharma// that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Mahārāja Priyavrata would not have to fight, for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// It is said that unless human society is regulated by //varṇāśrama-dharma,// it is no better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Mahārāja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained //varṇāśrama-dharma// by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess.

To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the //varṇāśrama-dharma// system, certain classes, such as the //brāhmaṇas// and //sannyāsīs,// do not need encouragement from the opposite sex. //Kṣatriyas// and //gṛhasthas,// however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in order to execute their duties. Indeed, a //gṛhastha// or //kṣatriya// cannot properly execute his responsibilities without the association of his wife. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally admitted that a //gṛhastha// must live with a wife. //Kṣatriyas// were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of //karma// and political affairs. To execute his duties properly, therefore. Mahārāja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhiṣmatī, who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhiṣmatī always kept Mahārāja Priyavrata very encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse //iva// has twice been used to indicate that Mahārāja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent //karmī// husband. Mahārāja Priyavrata thus ruled the universe for eleven //arbudas// of years. One //arbuda// consists of 100,000,000 years, and Mahārāja Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such //arbudas.//
