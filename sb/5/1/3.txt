===== Purport =====

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung, //nitāi pada-kamala, koṭī-candra suśītala, ye chāyāya jagat juḍāya.// He describes the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda as being so nice and cooling that all materialists, who are always in the blazing fire of material activities, may come under the shade of His lotus feet and be fully relieved and satiated. The distinction between family life and spiritual life can be experienced by any person who has undergone the tribulations of living with a family. One who comes under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord never becomes attracted by the activities of family life. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:59|(Bg. 2.59)]], //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:// one gives up lower engagements when he experiences a higher taste. Thus one becomes detached from family life as soon as he comes under the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.
