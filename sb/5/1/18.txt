===== Purport =====

The Vedic system of four //varṇas// and four //āśramas// is very scientific, and its entire purpose is to enable one to control the senses. Before entering household life (//gṛhastha-āśrama//), a student is fully trained to become //jitendriya,// a conqueror of the senses. Such a mature student is allowed to become a householder, and because he was first trained in conquering his senses, he retires from household life and becomes //vānaprastha// as soon as the strong waves of youthful life are past and he reaches the verge of old age at fifty years or slightly more. Then, after being further trained, he accepts //sannyāsa.// He is then a fully learned and renounced person who can move anywhere and everywhere without fear of being captivated by material desires. The senses are considered very powerful enemies. As a king in a strong fortress can conquer powerful enemies, so a householder in //gṛhastha-āśrama,// household life, can conquer the lusty desires of youth and be very secure when he takes //vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.//
