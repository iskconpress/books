~~Title: Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 5.26.18~~
~~bc:Text 18~~

{{description>A person is considered no better than a crow if after receiving some food, he does not divide it among guests, old men and children, but simply eats it himself, or if he eats it without performing the five kinds of sacrifice. After death he is put into the most abominable hell, known as Kṛmibhojana. In that hell is a lake 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] wide and filled with worms. He becomes a worm in that lake and feeds on the other worms there, who also feed on him. Unless he atones for his actions before his death, such a sinful man remains in the hellish lake of Kṛmibhojana for as many years as there are yojanas in the width of the lake.}}

===== Translation =====

**A person is considered no better than a crow if after receiving some food, he does not divide it among guests, old men and children, but simply eats it himself, or if he eats it without performing the five kinds of sacrifice. After death he is put into the most abominable hell, known as Kṛmibhojana. In that hell is a lake 100,000 yojanas [800,000 miles] wide and filled with worms. He becomes a worm in that lake and feeds on the other worms there, who also feed on him. Unless he atones for his actions before his death, such a sinful man remains in the hellish lake of Kṛmibhojana for as many years as there are yojanas in the width of the lake.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:13|(Bg. 3.13)]]:

> yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo
> mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ
> bhuñjate te tv agham pāpā
> ya pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt

"The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is first offered for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin." All food is given to us by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān:// the Lord supplies everyone with the necessities of life. Therefore we should acknowledge His mercy by performing //yajña// (sacrifice). This is the duty of everyone. Indeed, the sole purpose of life is to perform //yajña.// According to Kṛṣṇa [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]]:

> yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra
> loko 'yam karma-bandhanaḥ
> tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara

"Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage." If we do not perform //yajña// and distribute //prasāda// to others, our lives are condemned. Only after performing //yajña// and distributing the //prasāda// to all dependents---children, //brāhmaṇas// and old men---should one eat. However, one who cooks only for himself or his family is condemned, along with everyone he feeds. After death he is put into the hell known as Kṛmibhojana.
