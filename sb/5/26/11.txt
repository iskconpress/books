{{description>In this life, an envious person commits violent acts against many living entities. Therefore after his death, when he is taken to hell by Yamarāja, those living entities who were hurt by him appear as animals called rurus to inflict very severe pain upon him. Learned scholars call this hell Raurava. Not generally seen in this world, the ruru is more envious than a snake.}}

===== Purport =====

According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, the //ruru// is also known as the //bhāra-śṛṅga// (//ati-krūrasya bhāra-śṛṅgākhya-sattvasya apadeśaḥ saṁjñā//). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī confirms this in his //Sandarbha: ruru-śabdasya svayaṁ muninaiva ṭīkā-vidhānāl lokeṣv aprasiddha evāyaṁ jantu-viśeṣaḥ.// Thus although //rurus// are not seen in this world, their existence is confirmed in the //śāstras.//
