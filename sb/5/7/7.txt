===== Translation =====

**In this way, being purified by ritualistic sacrifices, the heart of Mahārāja Bharata was completely uncontaminated. His devotional service unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, increased day after day. Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva, is the original Personality of Godhead manifest as the Supersoul [Paramātmā] as well as the impersonal Brahman. Yogīs meditate upon the localized Paramātmā situated in the heart, jñānīs worship the impersonal Brahman as the Supreme Absolute Truth, and devotees worship Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose transcendental body is described in the śāstras. His body is decorated with the Śrīvatsa, the Kaustubha jewel and a flower garland, and His hands hold a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower. Devotees like Nārada always think of Him within their hearts.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Vāsudeva, or Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is manifest within the hearts of //yogīs// in His Paramātmā feature, and He is worshiped as impersonal Brahman by //jñānīs.// The Paramātmā feature is described in the //śāstras as// having four hands, holding disc, conchshell, lotus flower and club. As confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:2:8|(2.2.8)]]:

> kecit sva-dehāntar-hṛdayāvakāśe
> prādeśa-mātraṁ puruṣaṁ vasantam
> catur-bhujaṁ kañja-rathāṅga-śaṅkha-
> gadā-dharaṁ dhāraṇayā smaranti

Paramātmā is situated in the hearts of all living beings. He has four hands, which hold four symbolic weapons. All devotees who think of the Paramātmā within the heart worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the temple Deity. They also understand the impersonal features of the Lord and His bodily rays, the Brahman effulgence.
