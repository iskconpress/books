===== Purport =====

It is most important that the chief executive rule the citizens by keeping them fully engaged in their respective occupational duties. Some of the citizens were //brāhmaṇas, some// were //kṣatriyas,// and some were //vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// It is the duty of the government to see that the citizens act according to these material divisions for their spiritual advancement. No one should remain unemployed or unoccupied in any way. One must work as a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra// on the material path. and on the spiritual path, everyone should act as a //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// or //sannyāsī.// Although formerly the government was a monarchy, all the kings were very affectionate toward the citizens, and they strictly kept them engaged in their respective duties. Therefore society was very smoothly conducted.
