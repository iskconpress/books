**Once while touring the world, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Lord, reached a place known as Brahmāvarta. There was a great conference of learned brāhmaṇas at that place, and all the King's sons attentively heard the instructions of the brāhmaṇas there.

===== Purport =====

The instructions of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva to His sons are very valuable if one wants to live peacefully within this world, which is full of miseries. In the next chapter, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva gives His sons these valuable instructions.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Characteristics of Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
