===== Purport =====

From this verse we have good information of how the castes are qualified according to quality and work. Ṛṣabhadeva, a king, was certainly a //kṣatriya.// He had a hundred sons, and out of these, ten were engaged as //kṣatriyas// and ruled the planet. Nine sons became good preachers of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (//mahā-bhāgavatas//), and this indicates that they were above the position of //brāhmaṇas.// The other eighty-one sons became highly qualified //brāhmaṇas.// These are some practical examples of how one can become fit for a certain type of activity by qualification, not by birth. All the sons of Mahārāja Ṛṣabhadeva were //kṣatriyas// by birth, but by quality some of them became //kṣatriyas,// and some became //brāhmaṇas.// Nine became preachers of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (//bhāgavata-dharma-darśanāḥ//), which means that they were above the categories of //kṣatriya// and //brāhmaṇa.//
