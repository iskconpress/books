===== Translation =====

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, to glorify Mahārāja Nābhi, the old sages composed two verses. One of them is this: "Who can attain the perfection of Mahārāja Nābhi? Who can attain his activities? Because of his devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead agreed to become his son."**

===== Purport =====

The words //śuddhena karmaṇā// are significant in this verse. If work is not carried out in devotional service, it is contaminated by the modes of material nature. That is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā: yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]//). Activities performed only for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord are pure and are not contaminated by the modes of material nature. All other activities are contaminated by the modes of ignorance and passion, as well as goodness. All material activities meant for satisfying the senses are contaminated, and Mahārāja Nābhi did not perform anything contaminated. He simply executed his transcendental activities even when performing //yajña.// Consequently he obtained the Supreme Lord as his son.
