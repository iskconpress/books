===== Purport =====

This is an example of the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although He is one without a second, He expands Himself by //svāṁśa,// His personal expansion, and sometimes by //vibhinnāṁśa,// or His separated expansion. Lord Viṣṇu herein agrees to send His personal expansion as the son of Merudevī, the wife of Mahārāja Nābhi, who is the son of Āgnīdhra. The //ṛtvijaḥ,// the priests, knew that God is one, yet they prayed for the Supreme Lord to become the son of Mahārāja Nābhi to let the world know that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one without a second. When He incarnates, He expands Himself in different potencies.
