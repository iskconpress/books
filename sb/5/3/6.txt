===== Purport =====

One does not need great wealth, education or opulence to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one is fully absorbed in love and ecstasy, he need offer only a flower and a little water. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati:// "If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower. fruit or water, I will accept it." [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]]

The Supreme Lord can be pleased only by devotional service: therefore it is said here that the Lord is surely satisfied by devotion and nothing else. Quoting from the //Gautamīya-tantra,// the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// states:

> tulasī-dala-mātreṇa
> jalasya culukena vā
> vikrīṇīte svam ātmānaṁ
> bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaḥ

"Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is very affectionate toward His devotees, sells Himself to a devotee who offers merely a //tulasī// leaf and a palmful of water." The Supreme Lord is causelessly merciful upon His devotee, so much so that even the poorest of men can offer Him a little water and a flower in devotion and thus please Him. This is due to His affectionate dealings with His devotees.
