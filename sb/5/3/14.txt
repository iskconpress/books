===== Translation =====

**Dear Lord, unless one worships the lotus feet of great devotees, one will be conquered by the illusory energy, and his intelligence will be bewildered. Indeed, who has not been carried away by the waves of material enjoyment, which are like poison? Your illusory energy is unconquerable. No one can see the path of this material energy or tell how it is working.**

===== Purport =====

Mahārāja Nābhi was inclined to performing great sacrifices for begetting a son. The son might be as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such a material desire---be it great or insignificant---is brought about by the influence of //māyā.// A devotee does not at all desire anything for sense gratification. Devotion is therefore explained as devoid of material desires (//anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya//). Everyone is subjected to the influence of //māyā// and entangled in all kinds of material desire, and Mahārāja Nābhi was no exception. Freedom from //māyā's// influence is possible when one engages in the service of the great devotees (//mahac-caraṇa-sevā//). Without worshiping the lotus feet of a great devotee, one cannot be freed from //māyā's// influence. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says, //chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// "Who has been freed from //māyā's// clutches without serving the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava?" //Māyā// is //aparājita,// and her influence is also //aparājita.// As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]]:

> daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī
> mama māyā duratyayā

"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome."

Only a devotee can surpass //māyā's// great influence. It was no fault on Mahārāja Nābhi's part that he wanted a son. He wanted a son like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the best of all sons. By the association of the Lord's devotee, one no longer desires material opulence. This is confirmed in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:22:54|(Madhya 22.54)]]:

> "sādhu-saṅga", "sādhu-saṅga" sarva-śāstre kaya
> lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya

and [[books:cc:madhya:22:51|[Cc. Madhya 22.51]]]:

> mahat-kṛpā vinā kona karme 'bhakti' naya
> kṛṣṇa-bhakti dūre rahu, saṁsāra nahe kṣaya

If one is serious about escaping //māyā's// influence and returning home, back to Godhead, one must associate with a //sādhu// (devotee). That is the verdict of all scriptures. By the slight association of a devotee, one can be freed from the clutches of //māyā.// Without the mercy of the pure devotee, one cannot get freedom by any means. Certainly a pure devotee's association is necessary in order to obtain the loving service of the Lord. One cannot be freed from //māyā's// clutches without //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], the benediction of a great devotee. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:5:32|(7.5.32)]] Prahlāda Mahārāja says:

> naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ
> spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad arthaḥ
> mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-'bhiṣekaṁ
> niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat

One cannot become the Lord's pure devotee without taking the dust of a great devotee on his head (//pāda-rajo-'bhiṣekam//). A pure devotee is //niṣkiñcana;// he has no material desire to enjoy the material world. One has to take shelter of such a pure devotee in order to attain his qualities. The pure devotee is always free from the clutches of //māyā// and her influence.
