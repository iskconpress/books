~~bc:Text 17~~

{{description>The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: O great sages, I am certainly very pleased with your prayers. You are all truthful. You have prayed for the benediction of a son like Me for King Nābhi, but this is very difficult to obtain. Since I am the Supreme Person without a second and since no one is equal to Me, another personality like Me is not possible to find. In any case, because you are all qualified brāhmaṇas, your vibrations should not prove untrue. I consider the brāhmaṇas who are well qualified with brahminical qualities to be as good as My own mouth.}}

===== Translation =====

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: O great sages, I am certainly very pleased with your prayers. You are all truthful. You have prayed for the benediction of a son like Me for King Nābhi, but this is very difficult to obtain. Since I am the Supreme Person without a second and since no one is equal to Me, another personality like Me is not possible to find. In any case, because you are all qualified brāhmaṇas, your vibrations should not prove untrue. I consider the brāhmaṇas who are well qualified with brahminical qualities to be as good as My own mouth.**

===== Purport =====

The word //avitatha-gīrbhiḥ// means "they whose spoken vibrations cannot be nullified." The //brāhmaṇas// (//dvija,// the twice-born), are given a chance by the śāstric regulations to become almost as powerful as the Supreme Lord. Whatever a //brāhmaṇa// speaks cannot be nullified or changed in any circumstance. According to the Vedic injunctions, a //brāhmaṇa// is the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore in all rituals a //brāhmaṇa// is offered food (//brāhmaṇa-bhojana//) because when a //brāhmaṇa// eats, it is considered that the Supreme Lord Himself eats. Similarly, whatever a //brāhmaṇa// speaks cannot be changed. It must act. The learned sages who were priests at Mahārāja Nābhi's sacrifice were not only //brāhmaṇas// but were so qualified that they were like //devas,// demigods, or God Himself. If this were not the case, how could they invite Lord Viṣṇu to come to the sacrificial arena? God is one, and God does not belong to this or that religion. In Kali-yuga, different religious sects consider their God to be different from the God of others, but that is not possible. God is one, and He is appreciated according to different angles of vision. In this verse the word //kaivalyāt// means that God has no competitor. There is only one God. In the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// (6.8) it is said, //na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate:// "No one is found to be equal to Him or greater than Him." That is the definition of God.
