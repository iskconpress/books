{{description>In this materialistic life, there are many difficulties, as I have just mentioned, and all of these are insurmountable.

===== Purport =====

The conditioned soul has to accept all these conditions simply to enjoy sense gratification in this world. Although people declare themselves great scientists, economists, philosophers, politicians and sociologists. they are actually nothing but rascals. Therefore they have been described as //mūḍhas// and //narādhamas// in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:15|(Bg. 7.15)]]:

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ

"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind. whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me."

Due to their foolishness, all these materialists are described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as //narādhamas.// They have attained the human form in order to get released from material bondage, but instead of doing so, they become further embarrassed amid the miserable material conditions. Therefore they are //narādhamas,// the lowest of men. One may ask whether scientists, philosophers, economists and mathematicians are also //narādhamas,// the lowest of men, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead replies that they are because they have no actual knowledge. They are simply proud of their false prestige and position. Actually they do not know how to get relief from the material condition and renovate their spiritual life of transcendental bliss and knowledge. Consequently they waste time and energy in the search for so-called happiness. These are the qualifications of the demons. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it says that when one has all these demonic qualities, he becomes a //mūḍha// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Due to this, he envies the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore birth after birth he is born into a demonic family, and he transmigrates from one demonic body to another. Thus he forgets his relationship with Kṛṣṇa and remains a //narādhama// in an abominable condition life after life.
