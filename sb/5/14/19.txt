Śrīla Vidyāpati Ṭhākura has sung:

> tātala saikate,     vāri-bindu-sama, \\
> suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje

The happiness of family life is compared to a drop of water in the desert. No one can be happy in family life. According to the Vedic civilization, one cannot give up the responsibilities of family life, but today everyone is giving up family life by divorce. This is due to the miserable condition experienced in the family. Sometimes, due to misery, one becomes very hardened toward his affectionate sons, daughters and wife. This is but part of the blazing fire of the forest of material life.
