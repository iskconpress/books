**The path of this material world is full of material miseries, and various troubles disturb the conditioned souls. Sometimes he loses, and sometimes he gains. In either case, the path is full of danger. Sometimes the conditioned soul is separated from his father by death or other circumstances.

===== Purport =====

By thoroughly analyzing the materialistic way of life, any sane man can understand that there is not the least happiness in this world. However, due to continuing on the path of danger from time immemorial and not associating with saintly persons, the conditioned soul, under illusion, wants to enjoy this material world. Material energy sometimes gives him a chance at so-called happiness, but the conditioned soul is perpetually being punished by material nature. It is therefore said: //daṇḍya-jane rājā yena nadīte cubāya// [[books:cc:madhya:20:118|(Cc. Madhya 20.118)]]. Materialistic life means continuous unhappiness, but sometimes we accept happiness as it appears between the gaps. Sometimes a condemned person is submerged in water and hauled out. Actually all of this is meant for punishment, but he feels a little comfort when he is taken out of the water. This is the situation with the conditioned soul. All the //śāstras// therefore advise that one associate with devotees and saintly people.

> 'sādhu-saṅga', 'sādhu-saṅga'---sarva-śāstre kaya
> lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:54|(Cc. Madhya 22.54)]]

Even by a little association with devotees, the conditioned soul can get out of this miserable material condition. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore trying to give everyone a chance to associate with saintly people. Therefore all the members of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness society must themselves be perfect //sādhus// in order to give a chance to fallen conditioned souls. This is the best humanitarian work.
