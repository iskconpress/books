===== Purport =====

The //ācāryas// specifically mention that in this verse the words //mātuḥ anugrahāt// ("by the mercy of their mother") refer to the breast milk of their mother. In India it is a common belief that if a baby is fed his mother's milk for at least six months, his body will be very strong. Besides that, it is mentioned herein that all the sons of Āgnīdhra were endowed with the nature of their mother. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:1:40|(Bg. 1.40)]] also declares, //strīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya jāyate varṇa-saṅkaraḥ:// when women are polluted, //varṇa-saṅkara,// unqualified children, are generated, and when the //varṇa-saṅkara// population increases, the entire world becomes hellish. Therefore, according to //Manu-saṁhitā,// a woman needs a great deal of protection in order to remain pure and chaste so that her children can be fully engaged for the benefit of human society.
