===== Purport =====

In this verse, the words //bhagavān ādi-puruṣaḥ// are significant. //Bhagavān ādi-puruṣaḥ// is Lord Kṛṣṇa. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi .// Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original person. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// He is also addressed by Arjuna as //puruṣam ādyam,// the original person, and He is called Bhagavān. In this verse, however, we see that Lord Brahmā is described as //bhagavān ādi-puruṣaḥ.// The reason he is called //bhagavān// is that he fully represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is the first-born creature in this universe. Lord Brahmā could understand Mahārāja Āgnīdhra's desire because he is as powerful as Lord Viṣṇu. As Lord Viṣṇu, situated as Paramātmā, can understand the desire of the living entity, so Lord Brahmā can also understand the living entity's desire, for Viṣṇu, as a via medium, informs him. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:1:1|(1.1.1)]], //tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye:// Lord Viṣṇu informs Lord Brahmā of everything from within his heart. Because Mahārāja Āgnīdhra specifically worshiped Lord Brahmā, Lord Brahmā was pleased, and he sent Pūrvacitti, the Apsarā, to satisfy him.
