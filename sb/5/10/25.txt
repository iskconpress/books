{{description>O my dear lord, you are the friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the friend of all living entities. You are therefore equal to everyone, and you are free from the bodily conception. Although I have committed an offense by insulting you, I know that there is no loss or gain for you due to my insult. You are fixed in your determination, but I have committed an offense. Because of this, even though I may be as strong as Lord Śiva, I shall be vanquished without delay due to my offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava.}}

===== Purport =====

Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa was very intelligent and conscious of the inauspicious effects arising from insulting a Vaiṣṇava. He was therefore very anxious to be excused by Jaḍa Bharata. Following in the footsteps of Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa, everyone should be very cautious not to commit an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava. Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura in the //Caitanya-bhāgavata// (//Madhya// 13) says:

> śūlapāṇi-sama yadi bhakta-nindā kare
> bhāgavata pramāṇa---tathāpi śīghra mare
>
> hena vaiṣṇavere ninde sarvajña ha-i
> se janera adhaḥ-pāta sarva-śāstre ka-i

"Even if one is as strong as Lord Śiva, who carries a trident in his hand, one will nonetheless fall down from his spiritual position if he tries to insult a Vaiṣṇava. That is the verdict of all Vedic scriptures." He also says this in //Caitanya-bhāgavata// (//Madhya// 22):

> vaiṣṇavera nindā karibeka yāra gaṇa
> tāra rakṣā sāmarthya nāhika kona jana
>
> śūlapāṇi-sama yadi vaiṣṇavere ninde
> tathāpiha nāśa yāya---kahe śāstra-vṛnde
>
> ihā nā māniyā ye sujana nindā kare
> janme janme se pāpiṣṭha daiva-doṣe mare

"One who blasphemes a Vaiṣṇava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord Śiva, if he blasphemes a Vaiṣṇava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all //śāstras.// If one does not care for the verdict of the //śāstras// and dares blaspheme a Vaiṣṇava, he suffers life after life because of this."

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled, "The Discussion Between Jaḍa Bharata and Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa."
