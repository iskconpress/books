===== Purport =====

Although Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa was playing the part of a king, he had been informed by Jaḍa Bharata that be was not a king nor was Jaḍa Bharata deaf and dumb. Such designations were simply coverings of the spirit soul. Everyone must come to this knowledge. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:13|(Bg. 2.13)]]: //dehino 'smin yathā dehe.// Everyone is encased within the body. Since the body is never identical with the soul, the bodily activities are simply illusory. In the association of such a //sādhu// as Jaḍa Bharata, Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa came to the awareness that his activities as a royal authority were simply illusory phenomena. He therefore agreed to receive knowledge from Jaḍa Bharata, and that was the beginning of his perfection. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. A person like Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa, who was very inquisitive to know the value of life and the spiritual science, must approach a personality like Jaḍa Bharata. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// (SB 11.3.21). One must approach a //guru// like Jaḍa Bharata, a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to inquire about the goal of human life.
