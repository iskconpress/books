**King Rahūgaṇa said: O brāhmaṇa, you appear to be moving in this world very much covered and unknown to others. Who are you? Are you a learned brāhmaṇa and saintly person? I see that you are wearing a sacred thread. Are you one of those exalted, liberated saints such as Dattātreya and other highly advanced, learned scholars? May I ask whose disciple you are?

===== Purport =====

Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa was very anxious to receive further enlightenment in Vedic knowledge because he could understand that Jaḍa Bharata belonged to a //brāhmaṇa// family either by disciplic succession or by birth in a //brāhmaṇa// dynasty. As stated in the //Vedas: tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. Rahūgaṇa was accepting Jaḍa Bharata as a //guru,// but a //guru// must prove his position not only by wearing a sacred thread but by advancing knowledge in spiritual life. It is also significant that Rahūgaṇa asked Jaḍa Bharata which family he belonged to. There are two types of families---one according to dynasty and the other according to disciplic succession. In either way, one can be enlightened. The word //śuklaḥ// refers to a person in the mode of goodness. If one wants to receive spiritual knowledge, he must approach a bona fide //brāhmaṇa-guru,// either in the disciplic succession or in a family of learned //brāhmaṇas.//
