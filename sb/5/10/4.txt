Therefore we are not able to carry the palanquin with him.**

===== Purport =====

The other palanquin carriers were //śūdras,// whereas Jaḍa Bharata was not only a high-caste //brāhmaṇa// but also a great devotee. //Śūdras// do not sympathize with other living beings, but a Vaiṣṇava cannot act like a //śūdra.// Whenever a //śūdra// and a //brāhmaṇa// Vaiṣṇava are combined, there will certainly be imbalance in the execution of duties. The //śūdras// were walking with the palanquin without at all caring for the ants on the ground, but Jaḍa Bharata could not act like a //śūdra,// and therefore difficulty arose.
