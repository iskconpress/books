===== Purport =====

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung: //deha-smṛti nāhi yāra, saṁsāra-bandhana kāhāṅ tāra.// One who is spiritually advanced has no connection with the body or with the bodily actions and reactions. When one comes to understand that he is not the body and therefore is neither fat nor skinny, one attains the topmost form of spiritual realization. When one is not spiritually realized, the bodily conception entangles one in the material world. At the present moment all human society is laboring under the bodily conception; therefore in the //śāstras// people in this age are referred to as //dvipada-paśu,// two-legged animals. No one can be happy in a civilization conducted by such animals. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to raise fallen human society to the status of spiritual understanding. It is not possible for everyone to become immediately self-realized like Jaḍa Bharata. However, as stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:18|(1.2.18)]]: //naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// By spreading the //Bhāgavata// principles, we can raise human society to the platform of perfection. When one is not affected by the bodily conceptions, one can advance to the Lord's devotional service.

The more we advance our freedom from the bodily conception, the more we are fixed in devotional service, and the more we are happy and peaceful. In this regard, Śrīla Madhvācārya says that those who are too materially affected continue the bodily conception. Such persons are concerned with different bodily symptoms, whereas one freed from bodily conceptions lives without the body even in the material condition.
