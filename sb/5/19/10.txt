===== Purport =====

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has clearly declared:

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

The real success or fulfillment of the mission of human life can be achieved in India, Bhārata-varṣa, because in Bhārata-varṣa the purpose of life and the method for achieving success are evident. People should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Bhārata-varṣa, and this is especially so for those who are following the principles of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// If we do not take to the principles of //varṇāśrama-dharma// by accepting the four social orders (//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//) and the four orders of spiritual life (//brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa//), there can be no question of success in life. Unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, everything is now being lost. The inhabitants of Bhārata-varṣa are gradually becoming degraded //mlecchas// and //yavanas.// How then will they teach others? Therefore, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started not only for the inhabitants of Bhārata-varṣa but for all the people of the world, as announced by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There is still time, and if the inhabitants of Bhārata-varṣa take this movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously, the entire world will be saved from gliding down to a hellish condition. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement follows the process of //pañcarātrika-vidhi// and that of //bhāgavata-vidhi// simultaneously, so that people can take advantage of the movement and make their lives successful.
