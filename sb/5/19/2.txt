===== Purport =====

In the //Purāṇas// there are two different opinions concerning Lord Rāmacandra. In the //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// (5.34-36) this is confirmed in the description of the incarnation of Manu.

> vāsudevādi-rūpāṇām
> avatārāḥ prakīrtitāḥ
> viṣṇu-dharmottare rāma-
> lakṣmaṇādyāḥ kramādamī
>
> pādme tu rāmo bhagavān
> nārāyaṇa itīritaḥ
> śeṣaś cakraṁ ca śaṅkhaś ca
> kramāt syur lakṣmaṇādayaḥ

> mahā-vaikuṇṭhaloke ca
> rāghavedrasya kīrtitā

The //Viṣṇu-dharmottara// describes that Lord Rāmacandra and His brothers---Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna---are incarnations of Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha respectively. The //Padma Purāṇa,// however, says that Lord Rāmacandra is an incarnation of Nārāyaṇa and that the other three brothers are incarnations of Śeṣa, Cakra and Śaṅkha. Therefore Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has concluded, //tad idaṁ kalpa-bhedenaiva sambhāvyam.// In other words, these opinions are not contradictory. In some millenniums Lord Rāmacandra and His brothers appear as incarnations of Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and in other millenniums They appear as incarnations of Nārāyaṇa, Śeṣa, Cakra and Śaṅkha. The residence of Lord Rāmacandra on this planet is Ayodhyā. Ayodhyā City is still existing in the district of Faizabad, which is situated on the northern side of Uttar Pradesh.
