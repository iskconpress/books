===== Purport =====

The devotees mentioned in the previous verse approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead with material motives, but this verse explains how such devotees are saved from those desires. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:3:10|(2.3.10)]] advises:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

"Whether one is freed from all material desires, is full of material desires, or desires to become one with the Supreme, he should engage in devotional service." In this way, not only will the devotee's desires be fulfilled, but the day will come when he will have no other desire than to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. One who engages in the service of the Lord with some motive is called a //sakāma-bhakta,// and one who serves the Lord without any motives is called an //akāma-bhakta.// Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He turns a //sakāma-bhakta// into an //akāma-bhakta.// A pure devotee, an //akāma-bhakta,// who has no material motives, is satisfied simply to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:20-23|(Bg. 6.22)]]. //Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ:// if one engages in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he does not want anything more. This is the highest stage of devotional service. The Lord is so kind even to a //sakāma-bhakta,// a motivated devotee, that He satisfies his desires in such a way that one day he becomes an //akāma-bhakta.// Dhruva Mahārāja, for example, became a //bhakta// with the motive of getting a better kingdom than that of his father, but finally he became an //akāma-bhakta// and said to the Lord, //svāmin kṛtārtho'smi varaṁ na yāce: [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]]// "My dear Lord, I am very satisfied simply to serve Your lotus feet. I do not want any material benefits." Sometimes it is found that a small child eats dirty things, but his parents take away the dirty things and offer him a //sandeśa// or some other sweetmeat. Devotees who aspire for material benedictions are compared to such children. The Lord is so kind that He takes away their material desires and gives them the highest benediction. Therefore, even for material motives, one should not worship anyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; one must fully engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that all his desires will be fulfilled and at the end he can go back home, back to Godhead. This is explained in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// (//Madhya// 22.37-39, 41) as follows.

//Anyakāmī//---a devotee may desire something other than service to the lotus feet of the Lord; //yadi kare kṛṣṇera bhajana//---but if he engages in Lord Kṛṣṇa's service; //nā māgiteha kṛṣṇa tāre dena sva-caraṇa//---Kṛṣṇa gives him shelter at His lotus feet, even though he does not aspire for it. //Kṛṣṇa kahe//---the Lord says; //āmā bhaje//---"He is engaged in My service"; //māge viṣaya-sukha//---"but he wants the benefits of material sense gratification." //Amṛta chāḍi' viṣa māge://---"such a devotee is like a person who asks for poison instead of nectar." //Ei baḍa mūrkha:// "That is his foolishness." //Ami-vijña:// "But I am experienced." //Ei mūrkhe 'viṣaya' kene diba:// "Why should I give such a foolish person the dirty things of material enjoyment?" //Sva-caraṇa-mṛta:// "It would be better for Me to give him shelter at My lotus feet." //'Viṣaya' bhulāiba:// "I shall cause him to forget all material desires." //Kāma lāgi' kṛṣṇa bhaje//---if one engages in the service of the Lord for sense gratification; //paya kṛṣṇa-rase//---the result is that he ultimately gets a taste for serving the lotus feet of the Lord. //Kāma chāḍi' 'da' haite haya abhilāṣe:// He then gives up all material desires and wants to become an eternal servant of the Lord.
