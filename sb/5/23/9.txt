{{description>The body of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, which forms the Śiśumāra-cakra, is the resting place of all the demigods and all the stars and planets. One who chants this mantra to worship that Supreme Person three times a day—morning, noon and evening—will surely be freed from all sinful reactions. If one simply offers his obeisances to this form or remembers this form three times a day, all his recent sinful activities will be destroyed.}}

===== Purport =====

Summarizing the entire description of the planetary systems of the universe, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that one who is able to meditate upon this arrangement as the //virāṭ-rūpa,// or //viśva-rūpa,// the external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worship Him three times a day by meditation will always be free from all sinful reactions. Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura estimates that Dhruvaloka, the polestar, is 3,800,000 //yojanas// above the sun. Above Dhruvaloka by 10,000,000 //yojanas// is Maharloka, above Maharloka by 20,000,000 //yojanas// is Janaloka, above Janaloka by 80,000,000 //yojanas// is Tapoloka, and above Tapoloka by 120,000,000 //yojanas// is Satyaloka. Thus the distance from the sun to Satyaloka is 233,800,000 //yojanas,// or 1,870,400,000 miles. The Vaikuṇṭha planets begin 26,200,000 //yojanas// (209,600,000 miles) above Satyaloka. Thus the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// describes that the covering of the universe is 260,000,000 //yojanas// (2,080,000,000 miles) away from the sun. The distance from the sun to the earth is 100,000 yojanas, and below the earth by 70,000 yojanas are the seven lower planetary systems called Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talātala, Mahātala, Rasātala and Pātāla. Below these lower planets by 30,000 //yojanas,// Śeṣa Nāga is lying on the Garbhodaka Ocean. That ocean is 249,800,000 //yojanas// deep. Thus the total diameter of the universe is approximately 500,000,000 //yojanas,// or 4,000,000,000 miles.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Fifth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Śiśumāra planetary System."
