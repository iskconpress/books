===== Translation =====

**This great machine, consisting of the stars and planets, resembles the form of a śiśumāra [dolphin] in the water. It is sometimes considered an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva. Great yogīs meditate upon Vāsudeva in this form because it is actually visible.**

===== Purport =====

Transcendentalists such as //yogīs// whose minds cannot accommodate the form of the Lord prefer to visualize something very great, such as the //virāṭ-puruṣa.// Therefore some //yogīs// contemplate this imaginary //śiśumāra// to be swimming in the sky the way a dolphin swims in water. They meditate upon it as the //virāṭ-rūpa,// the gigantic form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
