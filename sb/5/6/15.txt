**"Who is that mystic yogī who can follow the examples of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva even with his mind? Lord Ṛṣabhadeva rejected all kinds of yogic perfection, which other yogīs hanker to attain. Who is that yogī who can compare to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva?"**

===== Purport =====

Generally //yogīs// desire the yogic perfections of //aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prākāmya, prāpti, īśitva, vaśitva// and //kāmāvasāyitā.// Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, however, never aspired for all these material things. Such //siddhis// (perfections) are presented by the illusory energy of the Lord. The real purpose of the //yoga// system is to achieve the favor and shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this purpose is covered by the illusory energy of //yogamāyā.// So-called //yogīs// are therefore allured by the superficial material perfections of //aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti// and so forth. Consequently ordinary //yogīs// cannot compare to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
