===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:5|(Bg. 18.5)]] Lord Kṛṣṇa says:

> yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma
> na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat
> yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva
> pāvanāni manīṣiṇām

"Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls."

Even one who has renounced the world and has taken //sannyāsa// should not renounce chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Renunciation does not mean that one has to renounce //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// Similarly, one should not renounce charity or //tapasya.// The //yoga// system for control of the mind and senses must be strictly followed. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva showed how severe types of //tapasya// could be performed, and He set an example for all others.
