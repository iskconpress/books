===== Translation =====

**Devotees always bathe themselves in devotional service in order to be relieved from the various tribulations of material existence. By doing this, the devotees enjoy supreme bliss, and liberation personified comes to serve them. Nonetheless, they do not accept that service, even if it is offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. For the devotees, liberation [mukti] is very unimportant because, having attained the Lord's transcendental loving service, they have attained everything desirable and have transcended all material desires.**

===== Purport =====

Devotional service unto the Lord is the highest attainment for anyone desiring liberation from the tribulations of material existence. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:20-23|(Bg. 6.22)]], //yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ:// "Gaining this, one thinks there is no greater gain." When one attains the service of the Lord, which is non-different from the Lord, one does not desire anything material. //Mukti// means relief from material existence. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura says: //muktiḥ mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'smān.// For a devotee, //mukti// is not a very great achievement. //Mukti// means being situated in one's constitutional position. The constitutional position of every living being is that of the Lord's servant; therefore when a living entity is engaged in the Lord's loving service, he has already attained //mukti.// Consequently a devotee does not aspire for //mukti,// even if it is offered by the Supreme Lord Himself.
