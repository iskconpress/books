===== Purport =====

The word //māyāmayam// used in this verse should not be understood according to the interpretations of the Māyāvādīs. //Māyā// means affection as well as illusion. When a mother deals with her child affectionately, she is called //māyāmaya.// In whatever form the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu appears, He is always affectionate toward His devotees. Thus the word //māyāmayam// is used here to mean "very affectionate toward the devotees." Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī writes in this regard that //māyāmayam// can also mean //kṛpā-pracuram,// deeply merciful. Similarly, Śrīla Vīrarāghava says, //māyā-pracuranātmīya-saṅkalpena parigṛhītam ity arthaḥ jñāna-paryāyo'tra māyā-śabdaḥ:// when one is very affectionate due to an intimate relationship, one is described as //māyāmaya.// Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains //māyāmayam// by dividing it into the words //māyā// and //āmayam.// He explains these words to indicate that because the living entity is covered by the disease of illusion, the Lord is always eager to deliver His devotee from the clutches of //māyā// and cure him of the disease caused by the illusory energy.
