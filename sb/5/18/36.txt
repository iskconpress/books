{{description>By manipulating a fire-generating stick, great saints and sages can bring forth the fire lying dormant within wood. In the same way, O Lord, those expert in understanding the Absolute Truth try to see You in everything—even in their own bodies. Yet you remain concealed. You are not to be understood by indirect processes involving mental or physical activities. Because You are self-manifested, only when You see that a person is wholeheartedly engaged in searching for You do You reveal Yourself. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.}}

**By manipulating a fire-generating stick, great saints and sages can bring forth the fire lying dormant within wood. In the same way, O Lord, those expert in understanding the Absolute Truth try to see You in everything---even in their own bodies. Yet you remain concealed. You are not to be understood by indirect processes involving mental or physical activities. Because You are self-manifested, only when You see that a person is wholeheartedly engaged in searching for You do You reveal Yourself. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.**

The word //kriyārthaiḥ// means "by performing ritualistic ceremonies to satisfy the demigods." The word //vipaścitaḥ// is explained in the //Taittirīya Upaniṣad// as follows: //satyaṁ jñānam anantaṁ brahma. yo veda nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ parame vyoman. so 'śnute sarvān kāmān saha brahmaṇā vipaściteti.// As Kṛṣṇa states in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:19|(Bg. 7.19)]], //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:// "After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me." When one understands that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart and actually sees the Lord present everywhere, he has perfect knowledge. The word //jāta-vedaḥ// means "fire which is produced by rubbing wood." In Vedic times, learned sages could bring forth fire from wood. //Jāta-vedaḥ// also indicates the fire in the stomach, which digests everything we eat and which produces an appetite. The word //gūḍha// is explained in the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad. Eko devaḥ sarva-bhūteṣu gūḍhaḥ:// The Supreme Personality of Godhead is understood by chanting the Vedic //mantras. Sarva-vyāpī sarva-bhūtāntar-ātmā:// He is all-pervading, and He is within the heart of living entities. //Karmādhyakṣaḥ sarva-bhūtādhivāsaḥ:// He witnesses all activities of the living entity. //Sākṣī cetā kevalo nirguṇaś ca:// The Supreme Lord is the witness as well as the living force, yet He is transcendental to all material qualities.
