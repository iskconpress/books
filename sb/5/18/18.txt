===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //māyāmaya// is further explained in regard to how the Lord expands His mercy in different ways. //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate: [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]// the energies of the Supreme Lord are understood in different ways. In this verse He is described as the original source of everything, even our body, senses, mind, activities, prowess, bodily strength, mental strength and determination for securing the necessities of life. Indeed, the Lord's energies can be perceived in everything. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:8|(Bg. 7.8)]], //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya:// the taste of water is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the active principle of everything we need for our maintenance.

This verse offering respectful obeisances unto the Lord was composed by Ramā, the goddess of fortune, and is full of spiritual power. Under the guidance of a spiritual master, everyone should chant this //mantra// and thus become a complete and perfect devotee of the Lord. One may chant this //mantra// for complete liberation from material bondage, and after liberation one may continue to chant it while worshiping the Supreme Lord in Vaikuṇṭhaloka. All //mantras,// of course, are meant for this life and the next life, as Kṛṣṇa Himself confirms in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:14|(Bg. 9.14)]]:

> satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ
> yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā
> nitya-yuktā upāsate

"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion." A devotee who both in this life and the next chants the //mahā-mantra,// or any //mantra,// is called //nitya-yuktopāsaka.//
