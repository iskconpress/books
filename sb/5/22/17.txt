===== Purport =====

Śrīla Madhvācārya quotes the following verse from the //Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa://

> jñānānandātmano viṣṇuḥ
> śiśumāra-vapuṣy atha
> ūrdhva-lokeṣu sa vyāpta
> ādityādyās tad-āśritā

Lord Viṣṇu, who is the source of knowledge and transcendental bliss, has assumed the form of Śiśumāra in the seventh heaven, which is situated in the topmost level of the universe. All the other planets, beginning with the sun, exist under the shelter of this Śiśumāra planetary system.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Orbits of the Planets."
