===== Purport =====

The process of liberation is //brahma jijñāsā,// the search for the Absolute Truth. Generally //brahma jijñāsā// is called //neti neti,// the process by which one analyzes existence to search out the Absolute Truth. This method continues as long as one is not situated in his spiritual life. Spiritual life is //brahma-bhūta [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]],// the self-realized state. In the words of //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]]:

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām

"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state, he attains pure devotional service unto Me."

The idea is to enter into the //parā bhakti,// the transcendental devotional service of the Supreme Lord. To attain this, one must analyze ones existence, but when one is actually engaged in devotional service, he should not bother seeking out knowledge. By simply engaging in devotional service undeviatingly, one will always remain in the liberated condition.

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]

The unflinching execution of devotional service is in itself //brahma-bhūta [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]].// Another important feature in this connection is //anena yogena yathopadeśam.// The instructions received from the spiritual master must be followed immediately. One should not deviate from or surpass the instructions of the spiritual master. One should not be simply intent on consulting books but should simultaneously execute the spiritual master's order (//yathopadeśam//). Mystic power should be achieved to enable one to give up the material conception, but when one actually engages in devotional service, one does not need to practice the mystic //yoga// system. The point is that one can give up the practice of //yoga,// but devotional service cannot be given up. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:7:10|(1.7.10)]]:

> ātmārāmāś ca munayo
> nirgranthā apy urukrame
> kurvanty ahaitukīṁ bhaktim
> ittham-bhūta-guṇo hariḥ

Even those who are liberated (//ātmārāma//) must always engage in devotional service. One may give up the practice of //yoga// when one is self-realized, but at no stage can one give up devotional service. All other activities for self-realization, including //yoga// and philosophical speculation, may be given up, but devotional service must be retained at all times.
