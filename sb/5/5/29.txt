**After accepting the feature of avadhūta, a great saintly person without material cares, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva passed through human society like a blind, deaf and dumb man, an idle stone, a ghost or a madman. Although people called Him such names, He remained silent and did not speak to anyone.**

===== Purport =====

The word //avadhūta// refers to one who does not care for social conventions, particularly the //varṇāśrama-dharma.// However, such a person may be situated fully within himself and be satisfied with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on whom he meditates. In other words, one who has surpassed the rules and regulations of //varṇāśrama-dharma// is called //avadhūta.// Such a person has already surpassed the clutches of //māyā,// and he lives completely separate and independent.
