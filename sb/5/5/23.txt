{{description>O respectful brāhmaṇas, as far as I am concerned, no one is equal or superior to the brāhmaṇas in this world. I do not find anyone comparable to them. When people know My motive after performing rituals according to the Vedic principles, they offer food to Me with faith and love through the mouth of a brāhmaṇa. When food is thus offered unto Me, I eat it with full satisfaction. Indeed, I derive more pleasure from food offered in that way than from the food offered in the sacrificial fire.}}

===== Translation =====

**O respectful brāhmaṇas, as far as I am concerned, no one is equal or superior to the brāhmaṇas in this world. I do not find anyone comparable to them. When people know My motive after performing rituals according to the Vedic principles, they offer food to Me with faith and love through the mouth of a brāhmaṇa. When food is thus offered unto Me, I eat it with full satisfaction. Indeed, I derive more pleasure from food offered in that way than from the food offered in the sacrificial fire.**

===== Purport =====

According to the Vedic system, after the sacrificial ceremony the //brāhmaṇas// are invited to eat the remnants of the offered food. When the //brāhmaṇas// eat the food, it is to be considered directly eaten by the Supreme Lord. Thus no one can be compared to qualified //brāhmaṇas.// The perfection of evolution is to be situated on the brahminical platform. Any civilization not based on brahminical culture or guided by //brāhmaṇas// is certainly a condemned civilization. Presently human civilization is based on sense gratification, and consequently more and more people are becoming addicted to different types of things. No one respects brahminical culture. Demoniac civilization is attached to //ugra-karma,// horrible activities, and big industries are created to satisfy unfathomable lusty desires. Consequently the people are greatly harassed by governmental taxation. The people are irreligious and do not perform the sacrifices recommended in //Bhagavad-gītā. Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ:// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]] by the performance of sacrifice, clouds form and rain falls. Due to sufficient rainfall, there is sufficient production of food. Guided by the //brāhmaṇas,// society should follow the principles of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Then people will become very happy. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni:// when animals and man are sufficiently fed with grains, they become stronger, their hearts become tranquil and their brains peaceful. They can then advance in spiritual life, life's ultimate destination.
