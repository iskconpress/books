===== Purport =====

There are many stories and incidents in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that are described figuratively. Such allegorical descriptions may not be understood by unintelligent men; therefore it is the duty of the student to approach a bona fide spiritual master for the direct explanation.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled, "Further Talks Between King Rahūgaṇa and Jaḍa Bharata."
