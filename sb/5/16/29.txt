===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura confirms that the townships of Lord Brahmā and the eight subordinate governors of the planetary systems, beginning with Indra, are mentioned in other //Purāṇas.//

> merau nava-pūrāṇi syur \\
manovaty amarāvatī \\
tejovatī saṁyamanī
> tathā kṛṣṇāṅganā parā
> śraddhāvatī gandhavatī
> tathā cānyā mahodayā
> yaśovatī ca brahmendra
> bahyādīnāṁ yathā-kramam

Brahmā's township is known as Manovatī, and those of his assistants such as Indra and Agni are known as Amarāvatī, Tejovatī, Saṁyamanī, Kṛṣṇāṅganā, Śraddhāvatī, Gandhavatī, Mahodayā and Yaśovatī. Brahmapurī is situated in the middle, and the other eight //purīs// surround it in all directions.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled, "A Description of Jambūdvīpa."
