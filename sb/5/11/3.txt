===== Translation =====

**A dream becomes automatically known to a person as false and immaterial, and similarly one eventually realizes that material happiness in this life or the next, on this planet or a higher planet, is insignificant. When one realizes this, the Vedas, although an excellent source, are insufficient to bring about direct knowledge of the truth.**

===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:45|(Bg. 2.45)]], Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to become transcendental to the material activities impelled by the three material modes of nature (//traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna//). The purpose of Vedic study is to transcend the activities of the three modes of material nature. Of course in the material world the mode of goodness is accepted as the best, and one can be promoted to the higher planetary systems by being on the //sattva-guṇa// platform. However, that is not perfection. One must come to the conclusion that even the //sattva-guṇa// platform is also not good. One may dream that he has become a king with a good family, wife and children, but immediately at the end of that dream he comes to the conclusion that it is false. Similarly, all kinds of material happiness are undesirable for a person who wants spiritual salvation. If a person does not come to the conclusion that he has nothing to do with any kind of material happiness, he cannot come to the platform of understanding the Absolute Truth, or //tattva jñāna. Karmīs, jñānīs// and //yogīs// are after some material elevation. The //karmīs// work hard day and night for some bodily comfort, and the //jñānīs// simply speculate about how to get out of the entanglement of //karma// and merge into the Brahman effulgence. The //yogīs// are very much addicted to the acquisition of material perfection and magical powers. All of them are trying to be materially perfect, but a devotee very easily comes to the platform of //nirguṇa// in devotional service, and consequently for the devotee the results of //karma, jñāna and yoga// become very insignificant. Therefore only the devotee is on the platform of //tattva jñāna,// not the others. Of course the //jñānī's// position is better than that of the //karmī// but that position is also insufficient. The //jñānī must// actually become liberated, and after liberation he may be situated in devotional service (//mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]).
