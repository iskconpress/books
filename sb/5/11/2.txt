**My dear King, talks of the relationship between the master and the servant, the king and the subject and so forth are simply talks about material activities. People interested in material activities, which are expounded in the Vedas, are intent on performing material sacrifices and placing faith in their material activities.

In this verse, two words are significant---//veda-vāda// and //tattva-vāda.// According to //Bhagavad-gītā,// those who are simply attached to the //Vedas// and who do not understand the purpose of the //Vedas// or the //Vedānta-sūtra// are called //veda-vāda-ratāḥ.//

"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the //Vedas,// which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say there is nothing more than this." [[books:bg:2:42-43|(Bg. 2.42-43)]]

The //veda-vāda// followers of the //Vedas// are generally inclined to //karma-kāṇḍa,// the performance of sacrifice according to the Vedic injunctions. They are thereby promoted to higher planetary systems. They generally practice the Cāturmāsya system. //Akṣayyaṁ ha vai cāturmāsya-yājinaḥ sukṛtaṁ bhavati:// one who performs the //cāturmāsya-yajña// becomes pious. By becoming pious, one may be promoted to the higher planetary systems (//ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]). Some of the followers of the //Vedas// are attached to //karma-kāṇḍa,// the fruitive activities of the //Vedas,// in order to be promoted to a higher standard of life. Others argue that this is not the purpose of the //Vedas. Tad yathaiveha karma jitaḥ lokaḥ kṣīyate evam evam utra puṇya jitaḥ lokaḥ kṣīyate.// In this world someone may become very highly elevated by taking birth in an aristocratic family, by being well educated, beautiful or very rich. These are the gifts for pious activities enacted in the past life. However, these will be finished when the stock of pious activity is finished. If we become attached to pious activities, we may get these various worldly facilities in the next life and may take birth in the heavenly planets. But all this will eventually be finished. //Kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti// [[books:bg:9:21|(Bg. 9.21)]]: when the stock of pious activity is finished, one again has to come to this //martya-loka.// According to the Vedic injunctions, the performance of pious activity is not really the objective of the //Vedas.// The objective of the //Vedas// is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā. Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]] the objective of the //Vedas// is to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are //veda-vādīs// are not actually advanced in knowledge, and those who are followers of //jñāna-kāṇḍa// (Brahman understanding) are also not perfect. However, when one comes to the platform of //upāsanā// and accepts the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes perfect (//ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param// ). In the //Vedas// the worship of different demigods and the performance of sacrifice are certainly, mentioned, but such worship is inferior because the worshipers do not know that the ultimate goal is Viṣṇu (//na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]). When one comes to the platform of //viṣṇor ārādhanam,// or //bhakti-yoga,// one has attained the perfection of life. Otherwise, as indicated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// one is not a //tattva-vādī// but a //veda-vādī, a// blind follower of the Vedic injunctions. A //veda-vādī// cannot be purified from material contamination unless he becomes a //tattva-vādī,// that is, one who knows //tattva,// the Absolute Truth. //Tattva// is also experienced in three features-//brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. Even after coming to the platform of understanding //tattva,// one must worship Bhagavān, Viṣṇu and His expansions, or one is not yet perfect. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]] after many births, one who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. The conclusion is that unintelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand Bhagavān, Brahman or Paramātmā, but after studying the //Vedas// and attaining the understanding of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is supposed to be on the platform of perfect knowledge.
