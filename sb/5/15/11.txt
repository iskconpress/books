{{description>Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mahārāja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the brāhmaṇas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's munificent charities. Consequently the brāhmaṇas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya's benefit in the next life.}}

===== Translation =====

**Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mahārāja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the brāhmaṇas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's munificent charities. Consequently the brāhmaṇas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya's benefit in the next life.**

===== Purport =====

As a //kṣatriya// or emperor, Mahārāja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the //brāhmaṇas// who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// were all satisfied with Mahārāja Gaya because of his proper administration. In other words, Mahārāja Gaya satisfied the //kṣatriya// kings by his fighting and satisfied the //brāhmaṇas// by his charities. The //vaiśyas// were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Mahārāja Gaya's constant sacrifices, the //śūdras// were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Mahārāja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When //brāhmaṇas// and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]], //tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā:// one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.
