===== Purport =====

Within a garden, a flowering tree attains a good reputation because of its fragrant flowers. Similarly, if there is a famous man in a family, he is compared to a fragrant flower in a forest. Because of him, an entire family can become famous in history. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa took birth in the Yadu dynasty, the Yadu dynasty and the Yādavas have remained famous for all time. Because of King Viraja's appearance, the family of Mahārāja Priyavrata has remained famous for all time.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// "The Glories of the Descendants of King Priyavrata."
