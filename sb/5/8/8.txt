**Gradually Mahārāja Bharata became very affectionate toward the deer. He began to raise it and maintain it by giving it grass. He was always careful to protect it from the attacks of tigers and other animals. When it itched, he petted it, and in this way he always tried to keep it in a comfortable condition. He sometimes kissed it out of love. Being attached to raising the deer, Mahārāja Bharata forgot the rules and regulations for the advancement of spiritual life, and he gradually forgot to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After a few days, he forgot everything about his spiritual advancement.**

===== Purport =====

From this we can understand how we have to be very cautious in executing our spiritual duties by observing the rules and regulations and regularly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// If we neglect doing this, we will eventually fall down. We must rise early in the morning, bathe, attend //maṅgala-ārati,// worship the Deities, chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// study the Vedic literatures and follow all the rules prescribed by the //ācāryas// and the spiritual master. If we deviate from this process, we may fall down, even though we may be very highly advanced. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:5|(Bg. 18.5)]]:

> yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma
> na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat
> yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva
> pāvanāni manīṣiṇām

"Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great soul." Even if one is in the renounced order, he should never give up the regulative principles. He should worship the Deity and give his time and life to the service of Kṛṣṇa. He should also continue following the rules and regulations of austerity and penance. These things cannot be given up. One should not think oneself very advanced simply because one has accepted the //sannyāsa// order. The activities of Bharata Mahārāja should be carefully studied for one's spiritual advancement.
