===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:6|(Bg. 4.6)]] Lord Kṛṣṇa says, //sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā:// "I appear by My internal potency. "The word //ātma-māyā// refers to the Lord's personal potency, //yogamāyā.// After creating both the material world and spiritual world through //yogamāyā,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally maintains them by expanding Himself in different categories as the Viṣṇu //mūrtis// and the demigods. He maintains the material creation from beginning to end, and He personally maintains the spiritual world.
