{{description>Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: My dear King, after giving up the body of a deer, Bharata Mahārāja took birth in a very pure brāhmaṇa family. There was a brāhmaṇa who belonged to the dynasty of Aṅgirā. He was fully qualified with brahminical qualifications. He could control his mind and senses, and he had studied the Vedic literatures and other subsidiary literatures. He was expert in giving charity, and he was always satisfied, tolerant, very gentle, learned and nonenvious. He was self-realized and engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He remained always in a trance. He had nine equally qualified sons by his first wife, and by his second wife he begot twins—a brother and a sister, of which the male child was said to be the topmost devotee and foremost of saintly kings—Bharata Mahārāja.

**Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: My dear King, after giving up the body of a deer, Bharata Mahārāja took birth in a very pure brāhmaṇa family.

===== Purport =====

Bharata Mahārāja was a great devotee, but he did not attain success in one life. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that a devotee who does not fulfill his devotional duties in one life is given the chance to be born in a fully qualified //brāhmaṇa// family or a rich //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// family. //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe// [[books:bg:6:41|(Bg. 6.41)]]. Bharata Mahārāja was the firstborn son of Mahārāja Ṛṣabha in a rich //kṣatriya// family, but due to his willful negligence of his spiritual duties and his excessive attachment to an insignificant deer, he was obliged to take birth as the son of a deer. However, due to his strong position as a devotee, he was gifted with the remembrance of his past life. Being repentant, he remained in a solitary forest and always thought of Kṛṣṇa. Then he was given the chance to take birth in a very good //brāhmaṇa// family.
