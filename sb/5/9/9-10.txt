Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung: //deha-smṛti nāhi yāra, saṁsāra-bandhana kāhāṅ tāra.// One who has no desire to maintain the body or who is not anxious to keep the body in order and who is satisfied in any condition must be either mad or liberated. Actually Bharata Mahārāja in his birth as Jaḍa Bharata was completely liberated from material dualities. He was a //paramahaṁsa// and therefore did not care for bodily comfort.
