===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:2|(Bg. 4.2)]]:

> evaṁ paramparā-prāptam
> imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ

"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way." This //paramparā// system extends from Manu to Ikṣvāku and from Ikṣvāku to his sons and grandsons. The rulers of the world in the line of hierarchy execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the //paramparā// system. Anyone interested in peaceful life must participate in this //paramparā// system and perform //yajñas.// As Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas in the //paramparā// system of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we must perform //saṅkīrtana-yajña// all over the world (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]). Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this age of Kali, and He will be easily satisfied if the //saṅkīrtana// movement is spread vigorously all over the world. This will also make people happy without a doubt.
