===== Purport =====

It is significant that Bali Mahārāja is here said to be very experienced. Although defeated, he was not at all sorry, for he knew that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since he was a devotee, he accepted his defeat without lamentation. As stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:47|(Bg. 2.47)]], //karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana.// Everyone in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should execute his duty, without regard for victory or defeat. One must execute his duty as ordered by Kṛṣṇa or His representative, the spiritual master. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. In first-class devotional service, one always abides by the orders and will of Kṛṣṇa.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "King Indra Annihilates the Demons."
