===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that Bali Mahārāja was not //paṇḍita-mānī,// or one who falsely assumes himself learned; rather, he was //paṇḍita-mānya-jñaḥ,// one who is so learned that all other learned persons worship him. And because he was so learned, he could disobey the order of his so-called spiritual master. He had no fear of any condition of material existence. Anyone cared for by Lord Viṣṇu does not need to care about anyone else. Thus Bali Mahārāja could never be bereft of all opulences. The opulences offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not to be compared to the opulences obtained by //karma-kāṇḍa.// In other words, if a devotee becomes very opulent, it is to be understood that his opulence is a gift of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such opulence will never be vanquished, whereas the opulence achieved by one's fruitive activity may be vanquished at any moment.
