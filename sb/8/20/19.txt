===== Translation =====

**At that time, the residents of the higher planetary system, namely the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Vidyādharas, the Siddhas and the Cāraṇas, all being very pleased by Bali Mahārāja's simple, nonduplicitous act, praised his qualities and showered upon him millions of flowers.**

===== Purport =====

//Ārjavam//---simplicity or freedom from duplicity---is a qualification of a //brāhmaṇa// and a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava automatically acquires all the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa.//

> yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā
> sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ
> [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]]

A Vaiṣṇava should possess the brahminical qualities such as //satya, śama, dama, titikṣā// and //ārjava// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. There cannot be any duplicity in the character of a Vaiṣṇava. When Bali Mahārāja acted with unflinching faith and devotion unto the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu, this was very much appreciated by all the residents of the higher planetary system.
