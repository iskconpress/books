===== Purport =====

As stated by Lord Śiva:

> ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ
> viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param
> tasmāt parataraṁ devi
> tadīyānāṁ samarcanam
> (//Padma Purāṇa//)

Although in the //Vedas// there are recommendations for worshiping many demigods, Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Person, and worship of Viṣṇu is the ultimate goal of life. The Vedic principles of the //varṇāśrama// institution are meant to organize society to prepare everyone to worship Lord Viṣṇu.

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of //varṇa// and //āśrama.// There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead." (//Viṣṇu Purāṇa// 3.8.9) One must ultimately worship Lord Viṣṇu, and for that purpose the //varṇāśrama// system organizes society into //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs.// Bali Mahārāja, having been perfectly educated in devotional service by his grandfather Prahlāda Mahārāja, knew how things are to be done. He was never to be misguided by anyone, even by a person who happened to be his so-called spiritual master. This is the sign of full surrender. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura said:

> mārabi rākhabi---yo icchā tohārā
> nitya-dāsa-prati tuyā adhikārā

When one surrenders to Lord Viṣṇu, one must be prepared to abide by His orders in all circumstances, whether He kills one or gives one protection. Lord Viṣṇu must be worshiped in all circumstances.
