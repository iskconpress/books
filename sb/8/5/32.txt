===== Purport =====

The word //mahī// refers to the five material elements---earth, water, air, fire and sky---which rest upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ.// The //mahat-tattva,// the total material energy, rests on His lotus feet, for the cosmic manifestation is but another opulence of the Lord. In this cosmic manifestation there are four kinds of living entities---//jarāyu ja// (those born from embryos), //aṇḍa ja// (those born from eggs), //sveda ja// (those born from perspiration), and //udbhijja// (those born from seeds). Everything is generated from the Lord, as confirmed in the //Vedānta-sūtra// (//janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]). No one is independent, but the Supreme Soul is completely independent. //Janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ.// The word //sva-rāṭ// means "independent." We are dependent, whereas the Supreme Lord is completely independent. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the greatest of all. Even Lord Brahmā, who created the cosmic manifestation, is but another opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The material creation is activated by the Lord, and therefore the Lord is not a part of the material creation. The Lord exists in His original, spiritual position. The universal form of the Lord, //vairāja-mūrti,// is another feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
