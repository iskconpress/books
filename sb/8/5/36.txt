===== Purport =====

The sun-god is considered to be the chief of the demigods. He is also considered to be the demigod who watches the northern side of the universe. He gives help for understanding the //Vedas.// As confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.52):

> yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ
> rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ
> yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"The sun, full of infinite effulgence, is the king of all the planets and the image of the good soul. The sun is like the eye of the Supreme Lord. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, in pursuance of whose order the sun performs his journey, mounting the wheel of time." The sun is actually the eye of the Lord. In the Vedic //mantras// it is said that unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead sees, no one can see. Unless there is sunlight, no living entity on any planet can see. Therefore the sun is considered to be the eye of the Supreme Lord. That is confirmed here by the words //yac-cakṣur āsīt// and in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// by the words //yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā.// The word //savitā// means the sun-god.
