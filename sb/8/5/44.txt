===== Translation =====

**Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is completely silent, free from endeavor, and completely satisfied by His own achievements. He is not attached to the activities of the material world through His senses. Indeed, in performing His pastimes in this material world, He is just like the unattached air.**

===== Purport =====

We can simply understand that behind the activities of material nature is the Supreme Lord, by whose indications everything takes place, although we cannot see Him. Even without seeing Him, we should offer Him our respectful obeisances. We should know that He is complete. Everything is done systematically by His energies (//parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]//), and therefore He has nothing to do (//na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate//). As indicated here by the word //upaśānta-śaktaye,// His different energies act, but although He sets these energies in action, He Himself has nothing to do. He is not attached to anything, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.
