===== Purport =====

//Karma-bandha,// the bondage of fruitive activities, entails the repetition of birth and death. One performs fruitive activities in such a way that he creates another body for his next life. As long as one is attached to fruitive activities, he must accept another material body. This repeated acceptance of material bodies is called //saṁsāra-bandhana.// To stop this, a devotee is advised to see the Supreme Lord constantly. The //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// or neophyte devotee, is therefore advised to visit the temple every day and see the form of the Lord regularly. Thus the neophyte devotee can be freed from the bondage of fruitive activities.
