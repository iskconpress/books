===== Translation =====

**Whenever the activities of Vāmanadeva are described in the course of a ritualistic ceremony, whether the ceremony be performed to please the demigods, to please one's forefathers in Pitṛloka, or to celebrate a social event like a marriage, that ceremony should be understood to be extremely auspicious.**

===== Purport =====

There are three kinds of ceremonies---specifically, ceremonies to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the demigods, those performed for social celebrations like marriages and birthdays, and those meant to please the forefathers, like the //śrāddha// ceremony. In all these ceremonies, large amounts of money are spent for various activities, but here it is suggested that if along with this there is recitation of the wonderful activities of Vāmanadeva, certainly the ceremony will be carried out successfully and will be free of all discrepancies.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Demigods Regain the Heavenly planets."
