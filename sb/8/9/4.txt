===== Purport =====

Even the //asuras// observed the etiquette that no one should address a married woman with lust. The great analyst Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, //mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:// one should consider another's wife to be one's mother. The //asuras,// the demons, took it for granted that the beautiful young woman, Mohinī-mūrti, who had arrived before them, was certainly not married. Therefore they assumed that no one in the world, including the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Cāraṇas and the Siddhas, had ever touched Her. The demons knew that the young girl was unmarried, and therefore they dared to address Her. They supposed that the young girl, Mohinī-mūrti, had come there to find a husband among all those present (the Daityas, the demigods, the Gandharvas and so on).
