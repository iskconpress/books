**Scorpions, cobras, poisonous drugs and other animals whose bites are poisonous took the opportunity to drink whatever little poison had fallen and scattered from Lord Śiva's hand while he was drinking.**

===== Purport =====

Mosquitoes, jackals, dogs and other varieties of //dandaśūka,// or animals whose bites are poisonous, drank the poison of the //samudra-manthana,// the churned ocean, since it was available after it fell from the palms of Lord Śiva.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Lord Śiva Saves the Universe by Drinking Poison."
