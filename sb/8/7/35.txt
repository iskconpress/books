===== Purport =====

When the demigods offered these prayers to Lord Śiva, their inner purpose was to please him so that he would rectify the disturbing situation created by the //hālahala// poison. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:20|(Bg. 7.20)]], //kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ:// when one worships demigods, this is certainly because of deep-rooted desires he wants fulfilled by the mercy of those demigods. People are generally attached to the worship of demigods for some motive.
