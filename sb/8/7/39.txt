===== Translation =====

**People in general, being bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are always engaged in animosity toward one another. But devotees, even at the risk of their own temporary lives, try to save them.**

===== Purport =====

This is the characteristic of a Vaiṣṇava. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī:// a Vaiṣṇava is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls unhappy. Otherwise, he would have no business teaching them how to become happy. In materialistic life, people must certainly engage in activities of animosity. Materialistic life is therefore compared to //saṁsāra-dāvānala ,// a blazing forest fire that automatically takes place. Lord Śiva and his followers in the //paramparā// system try to save people from this dangerous condition of materialistic life. This is the duty of devotees following the principles of Lord Śiva and belonging to the Rudra-sampradāya. There are four Vaiṣṇava //sampradāyas,// and the Rudra-sampradāya is one of them because Lord Śiva (Rudra) is the best of the Vaiṣṇavas (//vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ//). Indeed, as we shall see, Lord Śiva drank all the poison for the benefit of humanity.
