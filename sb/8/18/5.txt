Considering the Lord's appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planets, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.**

===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, an expert astrologer, explains the word //nakṣatra-tārādyāḥ.// The word //nakṣatra// means "the stars," the word //tāra// in this context refers to the planets, and //ādyāḥ// means "the first one specifically mentioned." Among the planets, the first is Sūrya, the sun, not the moon. Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer's proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted. The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week---Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday---corresponds to the Vedic order of the planets and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version. Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planets and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord.
