===== Translation =====

**When the great sages saw the Lord as the brahmacārī-dwarf Vāmana, they were certainly very pleased. Thus they placed before them Kaśyapa Muni, the Prajāpati, and performed all the ritualistic ceremonies, such as the birthday ceremony.**

===== Purport =====

According to Vedic civilization, when a child is born in the family of a //brāhmaṇa,// the birthday ceremony, known as //jāta-karma,// is first performed, and then other ceremonies are also gradually performed. But when this //vāmana-rūpa// appeared in the form of a //vaṭu,// or //brahmacārī,// His sacred thread ceremony was also performed immediately.
