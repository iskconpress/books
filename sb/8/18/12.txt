Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of Vāmana, a brāhmaṇa-dwarf, a brahmacārī, just like a theatrical actor.**

===== Purport =====

The word //naṭaḥ// is significant. An actor changes dress to play different parts, but is always the same man. Similarly, as described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33, 39), the Lord assumes many thousands and millions of forms (//advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam//). He is always present with innumerable incarnations (//rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu//). Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another. He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms. When Vāmanadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of Nārāyaṇa, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a //brahmacārī// (//vaṭu//). This means that His body is not material. One who thinks that the Supreme Lord assumes a material body is not intelligent. He has to learn more about the Lord's position. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]], //janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ.// One has to understand the transcendental appearance of the Lord in His original transcendental body (//sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]).
