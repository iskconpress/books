===== Purport =====

//Surabhi// cows are generally found on the Vaikuṇṭha planets. As described in //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Lord Kṛṣṇa, on His planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, engages in tending the //surabhi// cows (//surabhīr abhipālayantam// [Bs. 5.29]). These cows are the Lord's pet animals. From the //surabhi// cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires. In other words, the //surabhi// cow can yield milk unlimitedly. Milk is necessary for the performance of //yajña.// Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life. Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the //śāstras,// the //brahmā vādīs// took charge of the //surabhi// cow, in which the demons were not very interested.
