===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Upon Lord Śiva's drinking the poison, both the demigods and the demons, being very pleased, began to churn the ocean with renewed vigor. As a result of this, there appeared a cow known as surabhi.**

===== Purport =====

The //surabhi// cow is described as //havirdhānī,// the source of butter. Butter, when clarified by melting, produces ghee, or clarified butter, which is inevitably necessary for performing great ritualistic sacrifices. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā (//18.5//), yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat:// sacrifice, charity and austerity are essential to keep human society perfect in peace and prosperity. //Yajña,// the performance of sacrifice, is essential; to perform //yajña,// clarified butter is absolutely necessary; and to get clarified butter, milk is necessary. Milk is produced when there are sufficient cows. Therefore in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:44|(Bg. 18.44)]], cow protection is recommended (//kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva jam//).
