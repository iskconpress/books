Śrīla Madhvācārya remarks:

> teṣāṁ satyāc cālanārthaṁ
> harir dhanvantarir vibhuḥ
> samartho 'py asurāṇāṁ tu
> sva-hastād amucat sudhām

Dhanvantari, who was carrying the jug containing nectar, was a plenary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but although he was very strong, the //asuras// were able to take the jug of nectar from his hands.
