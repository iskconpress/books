===== Translation =====

**Because of the favor of the brāhmaṇas, the great soul Bali Mahārāja, thinking himself very satisfied, became very opulent and prosperous and began to enjoy the kingdom.**

===== Purport =====

The //brāhmaṇas// are called //dvija-deva,// and //kṣatriyas// are generally called //nara-deva.// The word //deva// actually refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //brāhmaṇas// guide human society in becoming happy by satisfying Lord Viṣṇu, and according to their advice, the //kṣatriyas,// who are called //nara-deva,// keep law and order so that other people, namely the //vaiśyas// and //śūdras,// may properly follow regulative principles. In this way, people are gradually elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Bali Mahārāja Conquers the Heavenly Planets."
