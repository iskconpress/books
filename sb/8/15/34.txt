===== Translation =====

**The brāhmaṇa descendants of Bhṛgu, being very pleased with their disciple, who had conquered the entire universe, now engaged him in performing one hundred aśvamedha sacrifices.**

===== Purport =====

We have seen in the dispute between Mahārāja Pṛthu and Indra that when Mahārāja Pṛthu wanted to perform one hundred //aśvamedha-yajñas,// Indra wanted to impede him, for it is because of such great sacrifices that Indra was made King of heaven. Here the //brāhmaṇa// descendants of Bhṛgu decided that although Mahārāja Bali was situated on the throne of Indra, he would not be able to stay there unless he performed such sacrifices. Therefore they advised Mahārāja Bali to perform at least as many //aśvamedha-yajñas// as Indra. The word //ayājayan// indicates that all the //brāhmaṇas// induced Bali Mahārāja to perform such sacrifices.
