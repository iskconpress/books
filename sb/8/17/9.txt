**My Lord, You are the all-pervading universal form, the fully independent creator, maintainer and destroyer of this universe.

You are never bewildered by illusion. O my Lord, let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.**

===== Purport =====

In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:2:117|(Ādi 2.117)]] it is said:

> siddhānta baliyā citte nā kara alasa
> ihā ha-ite kṛṣṇe lāge sudṛḍha mānasa

Anyone trying to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious must know the Lord's glories as far as they are possible to understand. Here Aditi hints at these glories. The universe is nothing but the external potency of the Lord. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]]: //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.// Whatever we see in this universe is but an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the sunshine and heat all over the universe are expansions of the sun. When one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he surpasses the influence of the illusory energy, for the Supreme Lord, being fully wise and being situated in the heart of everyone, especially in the heart of the devotee, gives one intelligence by which one is sure never to fall into illusion.
