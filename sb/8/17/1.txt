===== Translation =====

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King, after Aditi was thus advised by her husband, Kaśyapa Muni, she strictly followed his instructions without laziness and in this way performed the payo-vrata ritualistic ceremony.**

===== Purport =====

For advancement in anything, especially in spiritual life, one must strictly follow the bona fide instructions of the teacher. Aditi did this. She strictly followed the instructions of her husband and //guru.// As confirmed in the Vedic injunctions, //yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. One should have complete faith in the //guru,// who helps the disciple make progress in spiritual life. As soon as the disciple thinks independently, not caring for the instructions of the spiritual master, he is a failure (//yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi//). Aditi very strictly followed the instructions of her husband and spiritual master, and thus she was successful.
