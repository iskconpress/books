===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of those who observe vows and austerities, and it is He who bestows benedictions upon them. He is worshipable for the devotee throughout the devotee's life, for He never breaks His promises. As He says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:31|(Bg. 9.31)]], //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati:// "O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." The Lord is addressed here as //acyuta,// the infallible, because He takes care of His devotees. Anyone inimical to the devotees is certainly vanquished by the mercy of the Lord. The Lord is the source of the Ganges water, and therefore He is addressed here as //tīrtha-pāda,// indicating that all the holy places are at His lotus feet, or that whatever He touches with His foot becomes a holy place. //Bhagavad-gītā,// for example, begins with the words //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]].// Because the Lord was present on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, it became a //dharma-kṣetra,// a place of pilgrimage. Therefore the Pāṇḍavas, who were extremely religious, were assured of victory. Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His pastimes, such as Vṛndāvana or Dvārakā, becomes a holy place. The chanting of the holy name of the Lord---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare---is pleasing to the ear, and it expands good fortune to the audience who hears it chanted. Owing to the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi was fully assured that the troublesome condition created for her by the demons would now be ended.
