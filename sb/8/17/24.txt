===== Translation =====

**When Lord Brahmā understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was now within the womb of Aditi, he began to offer prayers to the Lord by reciting transcendental names.**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead exists everywhere (//aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]). Therefore when one chants His transcendental names---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare---the Supreme Personality of Godhead is automatically pleased by such //saṅkīrtana.// It is not that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is absent; He is present there. And when a devotee utters the transcendental name, it is not a material sound. Therefore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally pleased. A devotee knows that the Lord is present everywhere and that one can please Him simply by chanting His holy name.
