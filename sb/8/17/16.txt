{{description>O mother of the demigods, in My opinion almost all the chiefs of the demons are now unconquerable, for they are being protected by brāhmaṇas, whom the Supreme Lord always favors. Thus the use of power against them now will not at all be a source of happiness.}}

===== Translation =====

**O mother of the demigods, in My opinion almost all the chiefs of the demons are now unconquerable, for they are being protected by brāhmaṇas, whom the Supreme Lord always favors. Thus the use of power against them now will not at all be a source of happiness.**

===== Purport =====

When a person is favored by //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas, no one can defeat him. Even the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not interfere when one is protected by a //brāhmaṇa.// It is said, //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// The Lord's first inclination is to give all benedictions to the cows and //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore if //brāhmaṇas// favor someone, the Lord does not interfere, nor can anyone interfere with the happiness of such a person.
