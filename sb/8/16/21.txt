===== Purport =====

There are three kinds of men, who are called //akāma, mokṣa-kāma// and //sarva-kāma.// One who tries to get liberation from this material world is called //mokṣa-kāma,// one who wants to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent is called //sarva-kāma,// and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material desires is called //akāma.// A //bhakta// has no desire. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. He is purified and free from material desires. The //mokṣa-kāmī// wants to achieve liberation by merging into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is not yet pure. And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the //karmīs,// who have so many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the //śāstra// says:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

"Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service." [[books:sb:2:3:10|(SB 2.3.10)]]

Kaśyapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a //karmī, jñānī, yogī// or //bhakta,// should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of Vāsudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled. Kṛṣṇa is //dīna-anukampana:// He is very merciful to everyone. Therefore if one wants to fulfill his material desires, Kṛṣṇa helps him. Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed devotional service. It is said in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// ([[books:cc:madhya:22:38|Madhya 22.38-39]]):

> kṛṣṇa kahe,---'āmā bhaje, māge viṣaya-sukha
> amṛta chāḍi' viṣa māge,---ei baḍa mūrkha
>
> āmi---vijña, ei mūrkhe 'viṣaya' kene diba?
> sva-caraṇāmṛta diyā 'viṣaya' bhulāiba

"Kṛṣṇa says, 'If one engages in My transcendental loving service but at the same time wants the opulence of material enjoyment, he is very, very foolish. Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up ambrosia to drink poison. Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.' " If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely desires to engage at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and take away all his material desires and possessions. This is the Lord's special favor to devotees. Otherwise, if one takes to Kṛṣṇa's devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from all material desires, as Dhruva Mahārāja did, but this may take some time. However, if a very sincere devotee wants only Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, Kṛṣṇa directly gives him the position of //śuddha-bhakti,// unalloyed devotional service.
