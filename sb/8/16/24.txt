===== Purport =====

Here the process of devotional service is further explained. Kaśyapa Muni wanted to instruct Aditi in the same process recommended to him by Brahmā for satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is valuable. The //guru// does not manufacture a new process to instruct the disciple. The disciple receives from the //guru// an authorized process received by the //guru// from his //guru.// This is called the system of disciplic succession (//evaṁ paramparā-prāptaṁ imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]). This is the bona fide Vedic system of receiving the process of devotional service, by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased. Therefore, to approach a bona fide //guru,// or spiritual master, is essential. The bona fide spiritual master is he who has received the mercy of his //guru,// who in turn is bona fide because he has received the mercy of his //guru.// This is called the //paramparā// system. Unless one follows this //paramparā// system, the //mantra// one receives will be chanted for no purpose. Nowadays there are so many rascal //gurus// who manufacture their //mantras// as a process for material advancement, not spiritual advancement. Still, the //mantra// cannot be successful if it is manufactured. //Mantras// and the process of devotional service have special power, provided they are received from the authorized person.
