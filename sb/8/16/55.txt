===== Purport =====

In the Vedic system, //prasāda// is distributed, as recommended here, without discrimination as to who may take the //prasāda.// Regardless of whether one be a //brāhmaṇa, śūdra, vaiśya, kṣatriya,// or even the lowest of men, a //caṇḍāla,// he should be welcome to accept //prasāda.// However, when the //caṇḍālas,// the lower class or poorer class, are taking //prasāda,// this does not mean that they have become Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu. Nārāyaṇa is situated in everyone's heart, but this does not mean Nārāyaṇa is a //caṇḍāla// or poor man. The Māyāvāda philosophy of accepting a poor man as Nārāyaṇa is the most envious and atheistic movement in Vedic culture. This mentality should be completely given up. Everyone should be given the opportunity to take //prasāda,// but this does not mean that everyone has the right to become Nārāyaṇa.
