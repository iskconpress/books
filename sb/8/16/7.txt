===== Translation =====

**Homes from which guests go away without having been received even with an offering of a little water are like those holes in the field which are the homes of jackals.**

===== Purport =====

In a field there may be holes made by snakes and mice, but when there are very big holes, it may be supposed that jackals live there. Certainly no one goes to take shelter in such homes. Thus the homes of human beings where //atithis,// uninvited guests, are not properly received are like the homes of jackals.
