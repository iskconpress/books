===== Translation =====

**Aditi said: O my respected brāhmaṇa husband, all is well with the brāhmaṇas, the cows, religion and the welfare of other people. O master of the house, the three principles of dharma, artha and kāma flourish in household life, which is consequently full of good fortune.**

===== Purport =====

In household life one can develop the three principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification according to the regulations given in the //śāstras,// but to attain liberation one must give up household life and place himself in the transcendental renounced order. Kaśyapa Muni was not in the renounced order of life. Therefore he is addressed here once as //brahman// and another time as //gṛhamedhin.// Aditi, his wife, assured him that as far as household life was concerned, everything was going nicely, and the //brāhmaṇas// and cows were being honored and protected. In other words, there were no disturbances; household life was duly progressing.
