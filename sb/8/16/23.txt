Sometimes less intelligent men ask whether one has to approach a //guru// to be instructed in devotional service for spiritual advancement. The answer is given here---indeed, not only here, but also in //Bhagavad-gītā,// where Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as his //guru// (//śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam// [[books:bg:2:7|[Bg. 2.7]]]). The //Vedas// also instruct, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa guruṁ evābhigacchet:// [MU 1.2.12] one must accept a //guru// for proper direction if one is seriously inclined toward advancement in spiritual life. The Lord says that one must worship the //ācārya,// who is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyāt// [SB 11.17.27]). One should definitely understand this. In //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said that the //guru// is the manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, according to all the evidence given by the //śāstra// and by the practical behavior of devotees, one must accept a //guru.// Aditi accepted her husband as her //guru,// so that he would direct her how to advance in spiritual consciousness, devotional service, by worshiping the Supreme Lord.
