===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the material nature (//mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]//). Therefore, being the supreme controller of the laws of nature, the Lord cannot be under their influence. An example given in this regard is that although the wind blows through many places, the air is not affected by the qualities of these places. Although the air sometimes carries the odor of a filthy place, the air has nothing to do with such a place. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being all-good and all-auspicious, is never affected by the material qualities like an ordinary living entity. //puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte prakṛtijān guṇān// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. When the living entity is in the material nature, he is affected by its qualities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is not affected. Disrespectfully, one who does not know this considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead an ordinary living being (//avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]). //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ:// such a conclusion is reached by the unintelligent because they are unaware of the transcendental qualities of the Lord.
