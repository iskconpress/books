===== Purport =====

The conditioned soul, being wrapped in ignorance and therefore not knowing the goal of life, accepts a //guru// who can juggle words and make some display of magic that is wonderful to a fool. Sometimes a foolish person accepts someone as a //guru// because he can manufacture a small quantity of gold by mystic yogic power. Because such a disciple has a poor fund of knowledge, he cannot judge whether the manufacture of gold is the criterion for a //guru.// Why should one not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, from whom unlimited numbers of gold mines come into being? //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. All the gold mines are created by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, why should one accept a magician who can manufacture only a small portion of gold? Such //gurus// are accepted by those who are blind, not knowing the goal of life. Mahārāja Satyavrata, however, knew the goal of life. He knew the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he accepted the Lord as his //guru.// Either the Supreme Lord or His representative can become //guru.// The Lord says, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]] "One can get relief from the clutches of //māyā// as soon as he surrenders unto Me." Therefore it is the //guru's// business to instruct his disciple to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he wants relief from the material clutches. This is the symptom of the //guru.// This same principle was instructed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. In other words, one is advised not to accept a //guru// who does not follow the path of instruction given by Lord Kṛṣṇa.
