===== Purport =====

The Lord assumed one fish incarnation to save the //Vedas// at the beginning of the Svāyambhuva-manvantara, and at the end of the Cākṣuṣa-manvantara the Lord again assumed the form of a fish just to favor the great king named Satyavrata. As there were two incarnations of Varāha, there were also two incarnations of fish. The Lord appeared as one fish incarnation to save the //Vedas// by killing Hayagrīva, and He assumed the other fish incarnation to show favor to King Satyavrata.
