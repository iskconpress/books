**I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who pretended to be a gigantic fish, who restored the Vedic literature to Lord Brahmā when Lord Brahmā awakened from sleep, and who explained the essence of Vedic literature to King Satyavrata and the great saintly persons.**

===== Purport =====

Here is a summary of Satyavrata's meeting with the fish incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu. Lord Viṣṇu's purpose was to take back all the Vedic literatures from the demon Hayagrīva and restore them to Lord Brahmā. Incidentally, by His causeless mercy, the Lord spoke with Satyavrata. The word //satyavratānām// is significant because it indicates that those on the level of Satyavrata can take knowledge from the //Vedas// delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Lord is accepted as //Veda.// As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, vedānta-kṛd veda-vit:// the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the compiler of all Vedic knowledge, and He knows the purport of the //Vedas.// Therefore, anyone who takes knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, or from //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, knows the purpose of the //Vedas// (//vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]). One cannot understand Vedic knowledge from the //veda-vāda-ratās,// who read the //Vedas// and misconstrue their subject matter. One has to know the //Vedas// from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Matsya, the Lord's Fish Incarnation."

---This commentation has been finished in our New Delhi center today, the first of September, 1976, the day of Rādhāṣṭamī, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the //ācāryas.// Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta-sane vāsa janame janame haya, ei abhilāṣa.// I am attempting to present //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the English language by the order of my spiritual master, Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, and by his grace the work of translation is gradually progressing, and the European and American devotees who have joined the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are helping me considerably. Thus we have expectations of finishing the great task before my passing away. All glories to Śrī Guru and Gaurāṅga.
