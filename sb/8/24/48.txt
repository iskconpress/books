===== Translation =====

**One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities. Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire. May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.**

===== Purport =====

In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one's existence. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ śuddhyet// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle of birth and death (//kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]). Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death. The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord. There are various processes for self-realization, such as //karma, jñāna// and //yoga,// but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service. As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (//yat-sevayā//), but not by //karma, jñāna// or //yoga.// Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful.

The word //varṇam// refers to the luster of one's original identity. The original luster of gold or silver is brilliant. Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], is the luster of //ānanda,// or pleasure. //Ānandamayo bhyāsāt.// Every living entity has the right to become //ānandamaya,// joyful, because he is part of the //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,// Kṛṣṇa. Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his //svarūpa,// his original identity. This he can do only by devotional service. Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as //guror guruḥ,// the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.

Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord's representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore gives a definition of //guru. Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa:// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]] the bona fide //guru// is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by Kṛṣṇa. The bona fide //guru// is he who has accepted Kṛṣṇa as //guru.// This is the //guru-paramparā// system. The original //guru// is Vyāsadeva because he is the speaker of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// wherein everything spoken relates to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore //guru-pūjā// is known as Vyāsa-pūjā. In the final analysis, the original //guru// is Kṛṣṇa, His disciple is Nārada, whose disciple is Vyāsa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the //guru-paramparā.// One cannot become a //guru// if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa or His incarnation wants. The mission of the //guru// is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.
