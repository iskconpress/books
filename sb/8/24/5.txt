===== Translation =====

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King, for the sake of protecting the cows, brāhmaṇas, demigods, devotees, the Vedic literature, religious principles, and principles to fulfill the purpose of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts the forms of incarnations.**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead generally appears in various types of incarnations to give protection to the cows and //brāhmaṇas.// The Lord is described as //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca;// in other words, He is always eager to benefit the cows and //brāhmaṇas.// When Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared, He purposefully became a cowherd boy and showed personally how to give protection to the cows and calves. Similarly, He showed respect to Sudāmā Vipra, a real //brāhmaṇa.// From the Lord's personal activities, human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the //brāhmaṇas// and cows. Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved. Without protection of cows, brahminical culture cannot be maintained; and without brahminical culture, the aim of life cannot be fulfilled. The Lord, therefore, is described as //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya// because His incarnation is only for the protection of the cows and //brāhmaṇas.// Unfortunately, because in Kali-yuga there is no protection of the cows and brahminical culture, everything is in a precarious position. If human society wants to be exalted, the leaders of society must follow the instructions of //Bhagavad-gītā// and give protection to the cows, the //brāhmaṇas// and brahminical culture.
