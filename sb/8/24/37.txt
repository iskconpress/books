===== Purport =====

This particular devastation actually took place not during the night of Lord Brahmā but during his day, for it was during the time of Cākṣuṣa Manu. Brahmā's night takes place when Brahmā goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is Cākṣuṣa Manu. Therefore, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahmā, Brahmā felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord. This short period is regarded as Lord Brahmā's night. This has been elaborately discussed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta.// The following is a summary of his analysis. Because Agastya Muni cursed Svāyambhuva Manu, during the time of Svāyambhuva Manu a devastation took place. This devastation is mentioned in the //Matsya Purāṇa.// During the time of Cākṣuṣa Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another //pralaya,// or devastation. This is mentioned by Mārkaṇḍeya Ṛṣi in the //Viṣṇu-dharmottara.// At the end of Manu's time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the Cākṣuṣa-//manvantara,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation. Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī also agrees with this opinion. The //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// says:
