===== Purport =====

So-called //gurus// instruct their disciples for the sake of material profit. Some //guru// advises that one meditate in such a way that his intelligence will increase in regard to keeping his body fit for sense gratification. Another //guru// advises that sex is the ultimate goal of life and that one should therefore engage in sex to the best of his ability. These are the instructions of foolish //gurus.// In other words, because of the instructions of a foolish //guru// one remains perpetually in material existence and suffers its tribulations. But if one is intelligent enough to take instructions from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as enunciated in //Bhagavad-gītā// or the Sāṅkhya philosophy of Kapiladeva, one can very soon attain liberation and be situated in his original position of spiritual life. The words //nijaṁ padam// are significant. The living entity, being part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the birthright to a position in Vaikuṇṭhaloka, or the spiritual world, where there is no anxiety. Therefore, one should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna:// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]] after giving up one's body, one will return home, back to Godhead. The Lord lives in the spiritual world in His original personality, and a devotee who follows the instructions of the Lord approaches Him (//mām eti//). As a spiritual person, such a devotee returns to the Personality of Godhead and plays and dances with Him. That is the ultimate goal of life.
