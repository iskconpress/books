===== Purport =====

This verse describes the qualifications for devotees or persons highly elevated in spiritual consciousness. Devotees are always equal to everyone, seeing no distinction between lower and higher classes. //paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. They look upon everyone as a spirit soul who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Thus they are competent to search for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Understanding that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the friend of everyone (//suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]), they act as friends of everyone on behalf of the Supreme Lord. Making no distinction between one nation and another or one community and another, they preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā,// everywhere. Thus they are competent to see the lotus feet of the Lord. Such preachers in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are called //paramahaṁsas.// As indicated by the word //vimukta-saṅga,// they have nothing to do with material conditions. One must take shelter of such a devotee in order to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
