===== Purport =====

The King of the elephants, Gajendra, simply accepted that there must be someone who has created this cosmic manifestation and has supplied its ingredients. This should be admitted by everyone, even the most determined atheists. Why, then, do the nondevotees and atheists not admit this? The reason is that they are polluted by the reactions of their fruitive activities. One must be freed from all the dirt accumulated within the heart due to fruitive activities performed one after another. One must wash off this dirt by practicing //bhakti-yoga. Yoga-randhita-karmāṇaḥ.// As long as one is covered by material nature's modes of ignorance and passion, there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Lord. //Tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. When one is freed from the modes of ignorance and passion, one becomes free from the lowest qualities-//kāma// and //lobha,// lust and greed.

Nowadays there are so many //yoga// schools to encourage people in developing their lusty desires and greed through the practice of //yoga.// People are therefore very much fond of so-called //yoga// practice. The actual practice of //yoga,// however, is described here. As authoritatively stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.13.1), //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ:// a //yogī// is one who always meditates on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.38):

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa Himself, with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love." The //bhakti-yogī// constantly sees Śyāmasundara---beautiful Lord Kṛṣṇa with His blackish bodily hue. Because the King of the elephants, Gajendra, thought himself an ordinary animal, he thought himself unfit to see the Lord. In his humility, he thought that he could not practice //yoga.// In other words, how can those who are like animals in the bodily concept of life, and who have no purity of consciousness, practice //yoga//? In the present day, people who have no control over their senses, who have no understanding of philosophy and who do not follow religious principles or rules and regulations are nonetheless pretending to be //yogīs.// This is the greatest anomaly in the practice of mystic //yoga.//
