**My Lord, You are the cause of all causes, but You Yourself have no cause. Therefore You are the wonderful cause of everything. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic knowledge contained in the śāstras like the Pañcarātras and Vedānta-sūtra, which are Your representations, and who are the source of the paramparā system. Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described herein as the wonderful cause. He is wonderful in the sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]), He always remains complete (//pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate [Īśo// Invocation]). In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate.// Therefore He is the wonderful cause. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi .//

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam

"Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." (Bs. 5.1)

Even in this material world, we can understand that the sun has existed for millions of years and has given off heat and light since its creation, yet the sun still retains its power and never changes. What then is to be said of the supreme cause, //paraṁ brahma,// Kṛṣṇa? Everything emanates from Him perpetually, yet He maintains His original form (//sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ//). Kṛṣṇa personally says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]], //mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// "Everything emanates from Me." Everything emanates from Kṛṣṇa eternally, yet He is the same Kṛṣṇa and does not change. Therefore He is the shelter of all transcendentalists who are eager to get free from material bondage.

Everyone must take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. It is therefore advised:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

"Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service." [[books:sb:2:3:10|(SB 2.3.10)]] //Paraṁ brahma,// the Supreme Lord, and //paraṁ dhāma,// the supreme repose, is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore anyone who desires anything---whether he be a //karmī,// a //jñānī// or a //yogī//---should try to perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead very seriously, and all of his desires will be fulfilled. The Lord says, //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham:// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]] "As the living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly." Even the //karmī// who wants everything for his enjoyment can get it from Kṛṣṇa. For Kṛṣṇa, supplying what he wants is not at all difficult. Actually, however, one should worship Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the sake of getting liberation.

//Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. By studying the Vedic literature, one should understand Kṛṣṇa. As confirmed here, //sarvāgamāmnāya-mahārṇavāya.// He is the ocean, and all Vedic knowledge flows toward Him. Therefore, intelligent transcendentalists take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]). This is the ultimate goal.
