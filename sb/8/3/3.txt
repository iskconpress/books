===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]] the Lord says, //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:// "I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but everything rests upon My energy, just as an earthen pot rests on the earth." The place where an earthen pot rests is also earth. Then again, the earthen pot is manufactured by a potter, whose body is a product of earth. The potter's wheel with which the pot is made is an expansion of earth, and the ingredients from which the pot are made are also earth. As confirmed in the //śruti-mantra, yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante. yena jātāni jīvanti yat prayanty abhisaṁviśanti.// The original cause of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and after being annihilated, everything enters into Him (//prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām//). Thus the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead---Lord Rāmacandra or Lord Kṛṣṇa---is the original cause of everything.

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam

"Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." (Bs. 5.1) The Lord is the cause for everything, but there is no cause for Him. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma. Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Although He is everything, His personality is different from the cosmic manifestation.
