{{description>My Lord, those who are completely freed from material contamination always meditate upon You within the cores of their hearts. You are extremely difficult to attain for those like me who are too attached to mental concoction, home, relatives, friends, money, servants and assistants. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, uncontaminated by the modes of nature. You are the reservoir of all enlightenment, the supreme controller. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.}}

===== Purport =====

Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes into the material world, He is unaffected by the modes of material nature. This is confirmed in //Īśopaniṣad. Apāpa-viddham:// He is not contaminated. This same fact is described here. //Guṇa-saṅga-vivarjitāya.// Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is unaffected by the modes of material nature. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:11|(Bg. 9.11)]], //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam:// foolish men with insufficient knowledge deride the Personality of Godhead because He appears just like a human being. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood only by the //muktātmā,// the liberated soul. //Muktātmabhiḥ sva-hṛdaye paribhāvitāya:// only the liberated person can constantly think of Kṛṣṇa. Such a person is the greatest of all //yogīs.//

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]
