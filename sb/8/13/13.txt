===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:3|(Bg. 7.3)]] it is stated, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye:// out of many millions of people, one may attempt to achieve success in life. This success is explained here. //Rāddham indra-padaṁ hitvā tataḥ siddhim avāpsyati. Siddhi// consists of achieving the favor of Lord Viṣṇu, not the //yoga-siddhis.// The //yoga-siddhis-aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, vaśitva// and //kāmāvasāyitā//---are temporary. The ultimate //siddhi// is to achieve the favor of Lord Viṣṇu.
