===== Purport =====

The word //saṁvidam// is significant in this verse. The demigods and demons both agreed to stop fighting, at least for the time being, and endeavored to produce nectar. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura notes in this connection:

> saṁvid yuddhe pratijñāyām
> ācāre nāmni toṣaṇe
> sambhāṣaṇe kriyākāre
> saṅketa-jñānayor api

The word //saṁvit// is variously used to mean "in fighting," "in promising," "for satisfying," "in addressing," "by practical action," "indication," and "knowledge."
