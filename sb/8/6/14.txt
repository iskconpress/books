===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:13:3|(Bg. 13.3)]], //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.// The individual souls are proprietors of their individual bodies, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the proprietor of all bodies. Since He is the witness of everyone's body, nothing is unknown to Him. He knows what we need. Our duty, therefore, is to execute devotional service sincerely, under the direction of the spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa, by His grace, will supply whatever we need in executing our devotional service. In the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we simply have to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa and //guru.// Then all necessities will be supplied by Kṛṣṇa, even if we do not ask for them.
