===== Translation =====

**As long as you are not flourishing, you should make a truce with the demons and asuras, who are now being favored by time.**

===== Purport =====

One word in this verse has two readings---//kālena// and //kāvyena. Kālena// means "favored by time," and //kāvyena// means "favored by Śukrācārya," Śukrācārya being the spiritual master of the Daityas. The demons and Daityas were favored in both ways, and therefore the demigods were advised by the Supreme Lord to execute a truce for the time being, until time favored them.
