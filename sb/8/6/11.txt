{{description>O Supreme, You are independent in Your self and do not take help from others. Through Your own potency, You create this cosmic manifestation and enter into it. Those who are advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who are fully in knowledge of the authoritative śāstra, and who, through the practice of bhakti-yoga, are cleansed of all material contamination, can see with clear minds that although You exist within the transformations of the material qualities, Your presence is untouched by these qualities.}}

===== Purport =====

The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]]:

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
> sūyate sacarācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya
> jagad viparivartate

"This material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." The material energy creates, maintains and devastates the entire cosmic manifestation because of directions given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enters this universe as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu but is untouched by the material qualities. In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord refers to //māyā,// the external energy, which creates this material world, as //mama māyā,// "My energy," because this energy works under the full control of the Lord. These facts can be realized only by those who are well versed in Vedic knowledge and advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
