The Vedic //mantras// say: //yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati// (//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3). When the devotee sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his meditation, or when he sees the Lord personally, face to face, he becomes aware of everything within this universe. Indeed, nothing is unknown to him. Everything within this material world is fully manifested to a devotee who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]] therefore advises:

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ

"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth." Lord Brahmā is one of these self-realized authorities (//svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]). One must therefore accept the disciplic succession from Lord Brahmā, and then one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in fullness. Here the word //viśva-mūrtau// indicates that everything exists in the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is able to worship Him can see everything in Him and see Him in everything.
