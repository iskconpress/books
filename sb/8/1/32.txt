===== Purport =====

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading all over the world simply by describing Kṛṣṇa. We have published many books, including //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// in seventeen volumes, four hundred pages each, as well as //Bhagavad-gītā// and //The Nectar of Devotion.// We are also publishing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in sixty volumes. Wherever a speaker holds discourses from these books and an audience hears him, this will create a good and auspicious situation. Therefore the preaching of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be done very carefully by the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, especially the //sannyāsīs.// This will create an auspicious atmosphere.
