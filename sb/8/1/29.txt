===== Translation =====

**O King, in the Tāmasa manvantara the sons of Vidhṛti, who were known as the Vaidhṛtis, also became demigods. Since in course of time the Vedic authority was lost, these demigods, by their own powers, protected the Vedic authority.**

===== Purport =====

In the Tāmasa //manvantara// there were two kinds of demigods, and one of them was known as the Vaidhṛtis. The duty of the demigods is to protect the authority of the //Vedas.// The word //devatā// refers to one who carries the authority of the //Vedas,// whereas Rākṣasas are those who defy the Vedic authority. If the authority of the //Vedas// is lost, the entire universe becomes chaotic. Therefore, it is the duty of the demigods, as well as kings and aides of governments, to give full protection to the Vedic authority; otherwise human society will be in a chaotic condition in which there cannot be peace or prosperity.
