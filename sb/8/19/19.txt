===== Purport =====

According to Vedic understanding, the entire universe is regarded as an ocean of space. In that ocean there are innumerable planets, and each planet is called a //dvīpa,// or island. When approached by Lord Vāmanadeva, Bali Mahārāja was actually in possession of all the //dvīpas,// or islands in space. Bali Mahārāja was very pleased to see the features of Vāmanadeva and was ready to give Him as much land as He could ask, but because Lord Vāmanadeva asked only three paces of land, Bali Mahārāja considered Him not very intelligent.
