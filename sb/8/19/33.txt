===== Purport =====

Bali Mahārāja might argue that he had promised only three steps of land. But Śukrācārya, being a very learned //brāhmaṇa,// immediately understood that this was a plan of Hari, who had falsely appeared there as a //brahmacārī.// The words //mūḍha vartiṣyase katham// reveal that Śukrācārya was a //brāhmaṇa// of the priestly class. Such priestly //brāhmaṇas// are mostly interested in receiving remuneration from their disciples. Therefore when Śukrācārya saw that Bali Mahārāja had risked all of his possessions, he understood that this would cause havoc not only to the King but also to the family of Śukrācārya, who was dependent on Mahārāja Bali's mercy. This is the difference between a Vaiṣṇava and a //smārta-brāhmaṇa.// A //smārta-brāhmaṇa// is always interested in material profit, whereas a Vaiṣṇava is interested only in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the statement of Śukrācārya, it appears that he was in all respects a //smārta-brāhmaṇa// interested only in personal gain.
