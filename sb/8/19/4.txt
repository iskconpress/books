{{description>O King Bali, never in your dynasty has the low-minded King been born who upon being requested has refused charity to brāhmaṇas in holy places or a fight to kṣatriyas on a battlefield. And your dynasty is even more glorious due to the presence of Prahlāda Mahārāja, who is like the beautiful moon in the sky.}}

===== Translation =====

**O King Bali, never in your dynasty has the low-minded King been born who upon being requested has refused charity to brāhmaṇas in holy places or a fight to kṣatriyas on a battlefield. And your dynasty is even more glorious due to the presence of Prahlāda Mahārāja, who is like the beautiful moon in the sky.**

===== Purport =====

The symptoms of a //kṣatriya// are given in //Bhagavad-gītā.// One of the qualifications is the willingness to give charity (//dāna//). A //kṣatriya// does not refuse to give charity when requested by a //brāhmaṇa,// nor can he refuse to fight another //kṣatriya.// A king who does refuse is called low-minded. In the dynasty of Bali Mahārāja there were no such low-minded kings.
