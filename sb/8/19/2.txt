===== Purport =====

Prahlāda Mahārāja is a vivid example of a pure devotee. Someone might argue that since Prahlāda Mahārāja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Mahārāja, how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word //praśāntaḥ.// A devotee is always sober. He is never disturbed by any conditions. Even if a devotee remains in //gṛhastha// life and does not renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be //praśānta,// sober, because of his pure devotion to the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said:

> kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei 'guru' haya

"Whether one is a //brāhmaṇa,// a //sannyāsī// or a //śūdra//-regardless of what he is-he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa." [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|(Cc. Madhya 8.128)]] Anyone completely aware of the science of Kṛṣṇa, regardless of his status in life, is a //guru.// Thus Prahlāda Mahārāja is a //guru// in all circumstances.

Here His Lordship Vāmanadeva also teaches //sannyāsīs// and //brahmacārīs// that one should not ask more than necessary. He wanted only three paces of land, although Bali Mahārāja wanted to give Him anything He wanted.
