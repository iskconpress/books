===== Translation =====

**Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.**

===== Purport =====

In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful. Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with //māyā// we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life. What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of //varṇāśrama-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take //sannyāsa.//

> aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ
> sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam
> devareṇa sutotpattiṁ
> kalau pañca vivarjayet
> [[books:cc:adi:17:164|[Cc. Ādi 17.164]]]
> (//Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa//)

From this we can understand that in this age the //sannyāsa-āśrama// is forbidden because people are not strong. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed us an example in taking //sannyāsa// at the age of twenty-four years, but even Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya advised Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to be extremely careful because He had taken //sannyāsa// at an early age. For preaching we give young boys //sannyāsa,// but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit for //sannyāsa.// There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit for //sannyāsa;// if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the //āśrama// where sex is allowed, namely the //gṛhastha-āśrama.// That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile of //māyā.// One should take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a //gṛhastha// if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence. There is no need to give up the fight. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore recommended, //sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vān-manobhiḥ.// One may stay in whichever //āśrama// is suitable for him; it is not essential that one take //sannyāsa.// If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the //gṛhastha-āśrama.// But one must continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take //sannyāsa// artificially is not a very great credit. If //sannyāsa// is not suitable, one may enter the //gṛhastha-āśrama// and fight //māyā// with great strength. But one should not give up the fighting and go away.
