===== Translation =====

He consequently thought for a long time and finally reached the following decision.**

===== Purport =====

Everyone in the material world is engaged in a struggle for existence. Everyone tries to save himself from danger, but when one is unable to save himself, if he is pious, he then takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:16|(Bg. 7.16)]]:

> catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ
> janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna
> ārto jijñāsur arthārthī
> jñānī ca bharatarṣabha

Four kinds of pious men---namely, one who is in danger, one who is in need of money, one who is searching for knowledge and one who is inquisitive---begin to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to be saved or to advance. The King of the elephants, in his condition of danger, decided to seek shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. After considerable thought, he intelligently arrived at this correct decision. Such a decision is not reached by a sinful man. Therefore in //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that those who are pious (//sukṛtī//) can decide that in a dangerous or awkward condition one should seek shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.
