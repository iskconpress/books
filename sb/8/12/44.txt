===== Translation =====

**When I finished performing mystic yoga for one thousand years, you asked me upon whom I was meditating. Now, here is that Supreme Person to whom time has no entrance and who the Vedas cannot understand.**

===== Purport =====

Eternal time enters anywhere and everywhere, but it cannot enter the kingdom of god. Nor can the //Vedas// understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is an indication of the Lord's being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.
