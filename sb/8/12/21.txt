===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]] it is said, //daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā:// the external potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely strong. Indeed, everyone is fully captivated by her activities. Lord Śambhu (Śiva) was not to be captivated by the external potency, but because Lord Viṣṇu wanted to captivate Him also, He exhibited His internal potency to act the way that His external potency acts to captivate ordinary living entities. Lord Viṣṇu can captivate anyone, even such a strong personality as Lord Śambhu.
