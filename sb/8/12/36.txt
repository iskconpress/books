===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as all-powerful because no one can excel Him in any activity. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:7|(Bg. 7.7)]] the Lord says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya:// "O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me." No one can equal the Lord or be greater than Him, for He is the master of everyone. As stated in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|(Ādi 5.142)]], //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the only master of everyone, including even Lord Śiva, what to speak of others. Lord Śiva was already aware of the supreme power of Lord Viṣṇu, but when he was actually put into bewilderment, he felt proud to have such an exalted master.
