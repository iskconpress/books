===== Purport =====

Of the three chief demigods---Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara---all but Viṣṇu are under the influence of //māyā.// In //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// they are described as //māyī,// which means "under //māyā's// influence." But even though Lord Śiva associates with //māyā,// he is not influenced. The living entities are affected by //māyā,// but although Lord Śiva apparently associates with //māyā,// he is not affected. In other words, all living entities within this material world except for Lord Śiva are swayed by //māyā.// Lord Śiva is therefore neither //viṣṇu-tattva// nor //jīva-tattva.// He is between the two.
