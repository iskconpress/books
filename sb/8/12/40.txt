===== Purport =====

When Lord Śiva was present, his wife, Durgā, was also there. Durgā works in cooperation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in creating the cosmic manifestation. The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]], //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram:// "The material energy [//prakṛti//] works under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and is producing all moving and unmoving beings." //Prakṛti// is Durgā.

> sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā
> chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni bibharti durgā
> //// [Bs. 5.44]

The entire cosmos is created by Durgā in cooperation with Lord Viṣṇu in the form of //kāla,// time. //Sa īkṣata lokān nu sṛjā. Sa imāḹ lokān asṛjata.// This is the version of the //Vedas// (//Aitareya Upaniṣad// 1.1.1-2). //Māyā// happens to be the wife of Lord Śiva, and thus Lord Śiva is in association with //māyā,// but Lord Viṣṇu here assures Lord Śiva that this //māyā// will no longer be able to captivate him.
