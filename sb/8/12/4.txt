===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, resides within the material world as the //sattva-guṇa-avatāra.// Lord Śiva is the //tamo-guṇa-avatāra,// and Lord Brahmā is the //rajo-guṇa-avatāra,// but although Lord Viṣṇu is among them, He is not in the same category. Lord Viṣṇu is //deva-deva,// the chief of all the demigods. Since Lord Śiva is in this material world, the energy of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, includes Lord Śiva. Lord Viṣṇu is therefore called //jagad-vyāpī,// "the all-pervading Lord." Lord Śiva is sometimes called Maheśvara, and so people think that Lord Śiva is everything. But here Lord Śiva addresses Lord Viṣṇu as Jagad-īśa, "the master of the universe." Lord Śiva is sometimes called Viśveśvara, but here he addresses Lord Viṣṇu as Jagan-maya, indicating that even Viśveśvara is under Lord Viṣṇu's control. Lord Viṣṇu is the master of the spiritual world, yet He controls the material world also, as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]//). Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are also sometimes called //īśvara,// but the supreme //īśvara// is Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Brahma-saṁhitā, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ:// [Bs. 5.1] the Supreme Lord is Kṛṣṇa, Lord Viṣṇu. Everything in existence works in proper order because of Lord Viṣṇu. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Even //paramāṇu,// the small atoms, work because of Lord Viṣṇu's presence within them.
