===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that Mohinī-mūrti dragged Lord Śiva to so many places, especially to where the great sages lived, to instruct the sages that their Lord Śiva had become mad for a beautiful woman. Thus although they were all great sages and saintly persons, they should not think themselves free, but should remain extremely cautious about beautiful women. No one should think himself liberated in the presence of a beautiful woman. The //śāstras// enjoin:

> mātrā svasrā duhitrā vā
> nāviviktāsano bhavet
> balavān indriya-grāmo
> vidvāṁsam api karṣati

"One should not stay in a solitary place with a woman, even if she be his mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so uncontrollably powerful that in the presence of a woman one may become agitated, even if he is very learned and advanced." [[books:sb:9:19:17|(SB 9.19.17)]]
