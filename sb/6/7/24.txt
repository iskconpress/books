===== Translation =====

**Because of their firm determination to follow the instructions of Śukrācārya, his disciples, the demons, are now unconcerned about the demigods. In fact, kings or others who have determined faith in the mercy of brāhmaṇas, cows and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and who always worship these three are always strong in their position.**

===== Purport =====

From the instructions of Lord Brahmā it is understood that everyone should very faithfully worship the //brāhmaṇas,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca:// He is always very kind to cows and //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore one who worships Govinda must satisfy Him by worshiping the //brāhmaṇas// and cows. If a government worships the //brāhmaṇas,// the cows and Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, it is never defeated anywhere; otherwise it must always be defeated and condemned everywhere. At the present moment, all over the world, governments have no respect for //brāhmaṇas,// cows and Govinda, and consequently there are chaotic conditions all over the world. In summary, although the demigods were very powerful in material opulence, the demons defeated them in battle because the demigods had behaved disrespectfully toward a //brāhmaṇa,// Bṛhaspati, who was their spiritual master.
