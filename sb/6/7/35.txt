**Śrī Viśvarūpa said: O demigods, although the acceptance of priesthood is decried as causing the loss of previously acquired brahminical power, how can someone like me refuse to accept your personal request? You are all exalted commanders of the entire universe. I am your disciple and must take many lessons from you. Therefore I cannot refuse you. I must agree for my own benefit.**

===== Purport =====

The professions of a qualified //brāhmaṇa// are //paṭhana, pāṭhana, yajana, yājana, dāna// and //pratigraha.// The words //yajana// and //yājana// mean that a //brāhmaṇa// becomes the priest of the populace for the sake of their elevation. One who accepts the post of spiritual master neutralizes the sinful reactions of the //yajamāna,// the one on whose behalf he performs //yajña.// Thus the results of the pious acts previously performed by the priest or spiritual master are diminished. Therefore priesthood is not accepted by learned //brāhmaṇas.// Nevertheless, the greatly learned //brāhmaṇa// Viśvarūpa became the priest of the demigods because of his profound respect for them.
