===== Translation =====

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: O King, after making this promise to the demigods, the exalted Viśvarūpa, surrounded by the demigods, performed the necessary priestly activities with great enthusiasm and attention.**

===== Purport =====

The word //samādhinā// is very important. //Samādhi// means complete absorption with an undiverted mind. Viśvarūpa, who was a most learned //brāhmaṇa,// not only accepted the request of the demigods, but took their request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an undiverted mind. In other words, he accepted the priesthood not for material gain, but to profit the demigods. Such is the duty of a priest. The word //puraḥ// means "family," and //hita// means "benefit." Thus the word //purohita// indicates that the priest is the well-wisher of the family. Another meaning of the word //puraḥ// is "first." A priest's first duty is to see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means. Then he is satisfied. A priest should never be interested in performing Vedic rituals for his personal benefit.
