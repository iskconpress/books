{{description>Lord Brahmā said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your material opulence, you failed to receive Bṛhaspati properly when he came to your assembly. Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the brāhmaṇas. Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.}}

**Lord Brahmā said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your material opulence, you failed to receive Bṛhaspati properly when he came to your assembly. Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the brāhmaṇas. Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.**

===== Purport =====

Lord Brahmā recognized the brahminical qualifications of Bṛhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. Bṛhaspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified //brāhmaṇa.// Lord Brahmā chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this //brāhmaṇa,// who was their //guru.// Lord Brahmā wanted to impress upon the demigods that one's //guru// should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When Bṛhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt. Being very much displeased, Bṛhaspati immediately left Indra's palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of Bṛhaspati, and Lord Brahmā, being aware of this, condemned their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //cakṣu-dāna dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei:// the //guru// gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the //guru// should be considered his master, life after life. Under no circumstances should the //guru// be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their //guru.// Therefore //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.17.27) advises, //ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhyāsūyeta:// the //ācārya// should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the //ācārya,// considering him an ordinary human being.
