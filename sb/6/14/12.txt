===== Purport =====

It appears that the King first married one wife, but she could not bear a child. Then he married a second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children. In spite of the material assets of //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]] birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and beauty---he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son. Certainly his grief was natural. //Gṛhastha// life does not mean having a wife and no children. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, //putra-hīnaṁ gṛhaṁ śūnyam:// if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert. The King was certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times. //Kṣatriyas// especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so. Nonetheless, he had no issue.
