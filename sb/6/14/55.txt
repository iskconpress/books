~~Title: Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 6.14.55~~
~~bc:Text 55~~

{{description>My Lord, You may say that there is no law that a father must die in the lifetime of his son and that a son must be born in the lifetime of his father, since everyone lives and dies according to his own fruitive activity. However, if fruitive activity is so strong that birth and death depend upon it, there is no need of a controller, or God. Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children. Since You have cut the bonds of affection that compel a parent to raise his child, You appear inexperienced and unintelligent.}}

===== Purport =====

As stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām:// [Bs. 5.54] one who has taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service, is not affected by the results of //karma.// In this verse, //karma// has been stressed on the basis of //karma-mīmāṁsā// philosophy, which says that one must act according to his //karma// and that a supreme controller must give the results of //karma.// The subtle laws of //karma,// which are controlled by the Supreme, cannot be understood by ordinary conditioned souls. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that one who can understand Him and how He is acting, controlling everything by subtle laws, immediately becomes freed by His grace. That is the statement of //Brahma-saṁhitā// (//karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54]). One should take to devotional service without reservations and surrender everything to the supreme will of the Lord. That will make one happy in this life and the next.
