===== Purport =====

As stated by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita:

> mātā yasya gṛhe nāsti
> bhāryā cāpriya-vādinī
> araṇyaṁ tena gantavyaṁ
> yathāraṇyaṁ tathā gṛham

"A person who has no mother at home and whose wife does not speak sweetly should go to the forest. For such a person, living at home and living in the forest are equal." Similarly, for a woman who has no son, who is not cared for by her husband and whose co-wives neglect her, treating her like a maidservant, to go to the forest is better than to remain at home.
