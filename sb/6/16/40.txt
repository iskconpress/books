**O unconquerable one, when You spoke about bhāgavata-dharma, which is the uncontaminated religious system for achieving the shelter of Your lotus feet, that was Your victory.

===== Purport =====

As stated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu://

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]

"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desires for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service."

The //Nārada-pañcarātra// also says:

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

"One should be free from all material designations and cleansed of all material contamination. He should be restored to his pure identity, in which he engages his senses in the service of the proprietor of the senses. That is called devotional service." This is also called //bhāgavata-dharma.// Without material aspirations, one should simply serve Kṛṣṇa, as advised in //Bhagavad-gītā, Nārada-pañcarātra// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhāgavata-dharma// is the process of religion enunciated by pure devotees, direct representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead like Nārada, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and their humble servants in the disciplic succession. By understanding //bhāgavata-dharma,// one immediately becomes free from material contamination. Living entities, who are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are loitering in this material world suffering. When they are instructed by the Lord Himself about //bhāgavata-dharma// and they adopt it, that is victory for the Lord, for He then reclaims these fallen souls. A devotee following the principles of //bhāgavata-dharma// feels very much obligated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can understand the difference between life without //bhāgavata-dharma// and life with //bhāgavata-dharma// and thus he ever remains obliged to the Lord. Taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and bringing fallen souls to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is victory for Lord Kṛṣṇa.

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yayātmā suprasīdati

"The supreme occupation [//dharma//] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self." [[books:sb:1:2:6|(SB 1.2.6)]] Therefore //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the pure transcendental process of religion.
