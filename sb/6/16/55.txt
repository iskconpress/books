===== Purport =====

When the living entity becomes free from false ego, he understands his superior position as a spirit soul, part and parcel of the pleasure potency of the Lord. Thus, due to Brahman, even while sleeping the living entity can enjoy. The Lord says, "That Brahman, that Paramātmā and that Bhagavān are I Myself." This is noted by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī in his //Krama-sandarbha.//
