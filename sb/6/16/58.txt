{{description>A human being can attain perfection in life by self-realization through the Vedic literature and its practical application.

**A human being can attain perfection in life by self-realization through the Vedic literature and its practical application. This is possible especially for a human being born in India, the land of piety. A man who obtains birth in such a convenient position but does not understand his self is unable to achieve the highest perfection, even if he is exalted to life in the higher planetary systems.**

===== Purport =====

This statement is confirmed in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|(Ādi 9.41)]]. Lord Caitanya said:

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra

Everyone born in India, especially as a human being, can achieve the supreme success through the Vedic literature and its practical application in life. When one is perfect, he can render a service for the self-realization of the entire human society. This is the best way to perform humanitarian work.
