**My dear King, as a pot containing liquor cannot be purified even if washed in the waters of many rivers, nondevotees cannot be purified by processes of atonement even if they perform them very well.**

===== Purport =====

To take advantage of the methods of atonement, one must be at least somewhat devoted; otherwise there is no chance of one's being purified. It is clear from this verse that even those who take advantage of //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// but are not at least slightly devoted cannot be purified simply by following these other paths. The word //prāyaścittāni// is plural in number to indicate both //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa.// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says, //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa.// Thus Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura compares the paths of //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa// to pots of poison. Liquor and poison are in the same category. According to this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// a person who has heard a good deal about the path of devotional service, but who is not attached to it, who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, is like a pot of liquor. Such a person cannot be purified without at least a slight touch of devotional service.
