**The Yamadūtas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamarāja.**

===== Purport =====

The servants of Yamarāja replied quite properly. They did not manufacture principles of religion or irreligion. Instead, they explained what they had heard from the authority Yamarāja. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ:// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]] one should follow the //mahājana,// the authorized person. Yamarāja is one of twelve authorities. Therefore the servants of Yamarāja, the Yamadūtas, replied with perfect clarity when they said //śuśruma// ("we have heard"). The members of modern civilization manufacture defective religious principles through speculative concoction. This is not //dharma.// They do not know what is //dharma// and what is //adharma.// Therefore, as stated in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra:// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]] //dharma// not supported by the //Vedas// is rejected from //śrīmad-bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma// comprises only that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Bhāgavata-dharma// is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]] one must accept the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him and whatever He says. That is //dharma.// Arjuna, for example, thinking that violence was //adharma,// was declining to fight, but Kṛṣṇa urged him to fight. Arjuna abided by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore he is actually a //dharmī// because the order of Kṛṣṇa is //dharma.// Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]], //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// "The real purpose of //veda,// knowledge, is to know Me." One who knows Kṛṣṇa perfectly is liberated. As Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]:

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti so 'rjuna

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One who understands Kṛṣṇa and abides by His order is a candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. It may be concluded that //dharma,// religion, refers to that which is ordered in the //Vedas,// and //adharma,// irreligion, refers to that which is not supported in the //Vedas.//

Dharma is not actually manufactured by Nārāyaṇa. As stated in the //Vedas, asya mahato bhūtasya niśvasitam etad yad ṛg-vedaḥ iti:// the injunctions of //dharma// emanate from the breathing of Nārāyaṇa, the supreme living entity. Nārāyaṇa exists eternally and breathes eternally, and therefore //dharma,// the injunctions of Nārāyaṇa, also exist eternally. Śrīla Madhvācārya, the original //ācārya// for those who belong to the Mādhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya, says:

> vedānāṁ prathamo vaktā
> harir eva yato vibhuḥ
> ato viṣṇv-ātmakā vedā
> ity āhur veda-vādinaḥ

The transcendental words of the //Vedas// emanated from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Vedic principles should be understood to be Vaiṣṇava principles because Viṣṇu is the origin of the //Vedas.// The //Vedas// contain nothing besides the instructions of Viṣṇu, and one who follows the Vedic principles is a Vaiṣṇava. The Vaiṣṇava is not a member of a manufactured community of this material world. A Vaiṣṇava is a real knower of the //Vedas,// as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]).
