**Mahārāja Parīkṣit said: O my lord, O Śukadeva Gosvāmī, you have already described [in the Second Canto] the path of liberation [nivṛtti-mārga]. By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahmā. Thus one's repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.**

===== Purport =====

Since Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a Vaiṣṇava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned souls from the clutches of //māyā// and take them back home, back to Godhead. Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, about the //nivṛtti-mārga,// or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto. Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met Śukadeva Gosvāmī, inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī about the path of liberation at that crucial time. Śukadeva Gosvāmī very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:

> varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ
> kṛto loka-hitaṁ nṛpa
> ātmavit-sammataḥ puṁsāṁ
> śrotavyādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ

"My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people. The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists." [[books:sb:2:1:1|(SB 2.1.1)]]

Parīkṣit Mahārāja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of a Vaiṣṇava. //Vāñchā-kalpa-tarubhyaś ca kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca:// a Vaiṣṇava is an ocean of mercy. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī:// he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Śukadeva Gosvāmī continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The word //asaṁsṛti// is very important in this connection. //Saṁsṛti// refers to continuing on the path of birth and death. //Asaṁsṛti,// on the contrary, refers to //nivṛtti-mārga,// or the path of liberation, by which one's birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (//tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]). Parīkṣit Mahārāja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Śukadeva Gosvāmī about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul.

According to the opinion of the //ācāryas,// the word //krama-yogopalabdhena// indicates that by first performing //karma-yoga// and then //jñāna-yoga// and finally coming to the platform of //bhakti-yoga,// one can be liberated. //Bhakti-yoga,// however, is so powerful that it does not depend on //karma-yoga// or //jñāna-yoga. Bhakti-yoga// itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in //karma-yoga// or an illiterate with no assets in //jñāna-yoga// can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to //bhakti-yoga. Mām evaiṣyasy asaṁśayaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:7|(Bg. 8.7)]] that by the process of //bhakti-yoga// one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. //Yogīs,// however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahmā lives, as indicated here by the word //brahmaṇā.// At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahmā, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world. This is confirmed in the //Vedas// as follows:

> brahmaṇā saha te sarve
> samprāpte pratisañcare
> parasyānte kṛtātmānaḥ
> praviśanti paraṁ padam

"Because of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahmā."
