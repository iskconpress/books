===== Purport =====

The word //prakṛti// means material nature, and //puruṣa// may also refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with //prakṛti,// the female energy of Kṛṣṇa, and be separated from Kṛṣṇa by the illusion that he is able to enjoy //prakṛti,// he must continue in his conditional life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (//puruṣaṁ śāśvatam//), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]], //janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ:// one must simply understand the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes. This will keep one always in the association of Kṛṣṇa. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so'rjuna:// thus after giving up his gross material body, one accepts not another gross body but a spiritual body in which to return home, back to Godhead. Thus one ends the tribulation caused by his association with the material energy. In summary, the living entity is an eternal servant of God, but he comes to the material world and is bound by material conditions because of his desire to lord it over matter. Liberation means giving up this false consciousness and reviving one's original service to the Lord. This return to one's original life is called //mukti,// as confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (//muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]).
