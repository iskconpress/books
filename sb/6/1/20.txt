===== Purport =====

The //Purāṇas,// or old histories, are sometimes neglected by unintelligent men who consider their descriptions mythological. Actually, the descriptions of //the Purāṇas,// or the old histories of the universe, are factual, although not chronological. The //purāṇas// record the chief incidents that have occurred over many millions of years, not only on this planet but also on other planets within the universe. Therefore all learned and realized Vedic scholars speak with references to the incidents in the //Purāṇas.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī accepts the //Purāṇas// to be as important as the //Vedas// themselves. Therefore in //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// he quotes the following verse from the //Brahma-yāmala://

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva kalpate
> [Brs. 1.2.101]

"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the //Upaniṣads, purāṇas// and //Nārada-pañcarātra// is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society." A devotee of Kṛṣṇa must refer not only to the //Vedas,// but also to the //purāṇas.// One should not foolishly consider the //Purāṇas// mythological. If they were mythological, Śukadeva Gosvāmī would not have taken the trouble to recite the old historical incidents concerning the life of Ajāmila. Now the history begins as follows.
