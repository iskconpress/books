===== Purport =====

There are many instances throughout the world in which even a purified person, being attracted by a prostitute, spends all the money he has inherited. Prostitute hunting is so abominable that the desire for sex with a prostitute can ruin one's character, destroy one's exalted position and plunder all one's money. Therefore illicit sex is strictly prohibited. One should be satisfied with his married wife, for even a slight deviation will create havoc. A Kṛṣṇa conscious //gṛhastha// should always remember this. He should always be satisfied with one wife and be peaceful simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Otherwise at any moment he may fall down from his good position, as exemplified in the case of Ajāmila.
