{{description>To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.}}

===== Translation =====

**To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.**

===== Purport =====

//Tapaḥ// is explained in the //smṛti-śāstra// as follows: //manasaś cendriyāṇāṁ ca aikāgryaṁ paramaṁ tapaḥ.// "Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is called //tapaḥ.//" Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on devotional service. This is first-class //tapaḥ. Brahmacarya,// the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is called first-class //brahmacarya.// If a //brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī// talks with a woman in a secluded place, naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone's knowledge. Therefore a complete //brahmacārī// practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect //brahmacārī,// he can very easily control the mind and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue and the process of eating.

In the //bhakti-mārga,// the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by first controlling the tongue (//sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234]). The tongue (//jihvā//) can be controlled if one chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// does not speak of any subjects other than those concerning Kṛṣṇa and does not taste anything not offered to Kṛṣṇa. If one can control the tongue in this way, //brahmacarya// and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the //Vedas,// Śrīla Vīrarāghava Ācārya explains that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (//tapasānāśakena//). Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has also advised that //atyāhāra,// too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:17|(Bg. 6.17)]] Kṛṣṇa says:

> yuktāhāra-vihārasya
> yukta-ceṣṭasya karmasu
> yukta-svapnāvabodhasya
> yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā

"He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the //yoga// system."

In text 14 the word //dhīrāḥ,// meaning "those who are undisturbed under all circumstances," is very significant. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:14|(Bg. 2.14)]]:

> mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya
> śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ
> āgamāpāyino 'nityās
> tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata

"O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." In material life there are many disturbances (//adhyātmika, adhidaivika// and //adhibhautika//). One who has learned to tolerate these disturbances under all circumstances is called //dhīra.//
