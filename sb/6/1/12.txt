===== Translation =====

**My dear King, if a diseased person eats the pure, uncontaminated food prescribed by a physician, he is gradually cured, and the infection of disease can no longer touch him. Similarly, if one follows the regulative principles of knowledge, he gradually progresses toward liberation from material contamination.**

===== Purport =====

One is gradually purified if one cultivates knowledge, even through mental speculation, and strictly follows the regulative principles enjoined in the //śāstras// and explained in the next verse. Therefore the platform of //jñāna,// speculative knowledge, is better than the platform of //karma,// fruitive action. There is every chance of falling from the platform of //karma// to hellish conditions, but on the platform of //jñāna// one is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection. The difficulty is that on the platform of //jñāna// one thinks that he has been liberated and has become Nārāyaṇa, or Bhagavān. This is another phase of ignorance.

Because of ignorance, one speculatively thinks himself liberated from material contamination although actually he is not. Therefore even if one rises to //brahma jñāna,// understanding of Brahman, one nevertheless falls down because of not taking shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Nonetheless, //jñānīs// at least know what is sinful and what is pious, and they very cautiously act according to the injunctions of the //śāstras.//
