===== Purport =====

One should not think that the person who takes to //bhakti// is one who cannot perform the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the //karma-kāṇḍa// section of the //Vedas// or is not sufficiently educated to speculate on spiritual subjects. Māyāvādīs generally allege that the //bhakti// path is for women and illiterates. This is a groundless accusation. The //bhakti// path is followed by the most learned scholars, such as the Gosvāmīs, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Rāmānujācārya. These are the actual followers of the //bhakti// path. Regardless of whether or not one is educated or aristocratic, one must follow in their footsteps. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ:// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]] one must follow the path of the //mahājanas.// The //mahājanas// are those who have taken to the path of devotional service (//suśīlāḥ sādhavo yatra nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ//), for these great personalities are the perfect persons. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:18:12|(5.18.12)]]:

> yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā
> sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ

"One who has unflinching devotion to the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods." The less intelligent, however, misunderstand the //bhakti// path and therefore allege that it is for one who cannot execute ritualistic ceremonies or speculate. As confirmed here by the word //sadhrīcīnaḥ, bhakti// is the path that is appropriate, not the paths of //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa.// Māyāvādīs may be //suśīlāḥ sādhavaḥ// (well-behaved saintly persons), but there is nevertheless some doubt about whether they are actually making progress, for they have not accepted the path of //bhakti.// On the other hand, those who follow the path of the //ācāryas// are //suśīlāḥ// and //sādhavaḥ,// but furthermore their path is //akuto-bhaya,// which means free from fear. One should fearlessly follow the twelve //mahājanas// and their line of disciplic succession and thus be liberated from the clutches of //māyā.//
