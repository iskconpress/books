===== Translation =====

**Ajāmila fully engaged in devotional service. Thus he detached his mind from the process of sense gratification and became fully absorbed in thinking of the form of the Lord.**

===== Purport =====

If one worships the Deity in the temple, one's mind will naturally be absorbed in thought of the Lord and His form. There is no distinction between the form of the Lord and the Lord Himself. Therefore //bhakti-yoga// is the most easy system of //yoga. Yogīs// try to concentrate their minds upon the form of the Supersoul, Viṣṇu, within the heart, but this same objective is easily achieved when one's mind is absorbed in the Deity worshiped in the temple. In every temple there is a transcendental form of the Lord, and one may easily think of this form. By seeing the Lord during //ārati,// by offering //bhoga// and by constantly thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class //yogī.// This is the best process of //yoga,// as confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]:

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." The first-class //yogī// is he who controls his senses and detaches himself from material activities by always thinking of the form of the Lord.
