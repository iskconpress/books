**And where have those four liberated and very beautiful persons gone who released me from arrest and saved me from being dragged down to the hellish regions?**

===== Purport =====

As we have learned from the descriptions in the Fifth Canto, the hellish planets are situated in the lower portions of this universe. Therefore they are called //adho bhuvaḥ.// Ajāmila could understand that the Yamadūtas had come from that region.
