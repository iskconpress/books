===== Purport =====

According to Vedic civilization, everyone has the responsibility for taking care of //brāhmaṇas,// old men, women, children and cows. This is the duty of everyone, especially an upper-class person. Because of his association with a prostitute, Ajāmila abandoned all his duties. Regretting this, Ajāmila now considered himself quite fallen.
