===== Purport =====

As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (11.2.42), //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca:// devotional service is so powerful that one who performs devotional service is immediately freed from all sinful desires. All desires within this material world are sinful because material desire means sense gratification, which always involves action that is more or less sinful. Pure //bhakti,// however, is //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya;// in other words, it is free from material desires, which result from //karma// and //jñāna.// One who is situated in devotional service no longer has material desires, and therefore he is beyond sinful life. Material desires should be completely stopped. Otherwise, although one's austerities, penances and charity may free one from sin for the time being, one's desires will reappear because his heart is impure. Thus he will act sinfully and suffer.
