===== Purport =====

The men of the higher classes---the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas//---do not beget children in the wombs of lower-class women. Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable. Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born in the //vipra-varṇa, kṣatriya-varṇa, vaiśya-varṇa// or //śūdra-varṇa,// according to the three qualities of material nature. This must be examined because a marriage between a boy of the //vipra-varṇa// and a girl of the //śūdra-varṇa// is incompatible; married life would be miserable for both husband and wife. Consequently a boy should marry a girl of the same category. Of course, this is //trai-guṇya,// a material calculation according to the //Vedas,// but if the boy and girl are devotees there need be no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very happy combination.
