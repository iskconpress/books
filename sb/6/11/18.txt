Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings:

> ei chaya gosāñi yāra, mui tāra dāsa
> tāṅ' sabāra pada-reṇu mora pañca-grāsa

"I am the servant of the six Gosvāmīs, and the dust of their lotus feet provides my five kinds of food." A Vaiṣṇava always desires the dust of the lotus feet of previous //ācāryas// and Vaiṣṇavas. Vṛtrāsura was certain that he would be killed in the battle with Indra, because this was the desire of Lord Viṣṇu. He was prepared for death because he knew that after his death he was destined to return home, back to Godhead. This is a great destination, and it is achieved by the grace of a Vaiṣṇava. //Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// no one has ever gone back to Godhead without being favored by a Vaiṣṇava. In this verse, therefore, we find the words //manasvināṁ pāda-rajaḥ prapatsye:// "I shall receive the dust of the lotus feet of great devotees." The word //manasvinām// refers to great devotees who always think of Kṛṣṇa. They are always peaceful, thinking of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore they are called //dhīra.// The best example of such a devotee is Nārada Muni. If one receives the dust of the lotus feet of a //manasvī,// a great devotee, he certainly returns home, back to Godhead.
