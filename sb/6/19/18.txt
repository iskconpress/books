Therefore if the wife is unable to execute this process, the husband should carefully do so, and the faithful wife will share the result.**

The relationship between husband and wife is firmly established when the wife is faithful and the husband sincere. Then even if the wife, being weaker, is unable to execute devotional service with her husband, if she is chaste and sincere she shares half of her husband's activities.
