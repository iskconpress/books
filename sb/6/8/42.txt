**King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Viśvarūpa. After conquering the demons, he enjoyed all the opulences of the three worlds.**

===== Purport =====

This mystical mantric armor given by Viśvarūpa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the effect that Indra was able to conquer the //asuras// and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without impediments. In this regard, Madhvācārya points out:

> vidyāḥ karmāṇi ca sadā
> guroḥ prāptāḥ phala-pradāḥ
> anyathā naiva phaladāḥ
> prasannoktāḥ phala-pradāḥ

One must receive all kinds of //mantras// from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the //mantras// will not be fruitful. This is also indicated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(Bg. 4.34)]]:

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ

"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth." All //mantras// should be received through the authorized //guru,// and the disciple must satisfy the //guru// in all respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet. In the //Padma Purāṇa// it is also said, //sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā matāḥ.// There are four //sampradāyas,// or disciplic successions, namely the Brahma-sampradāya, the Rudra-sampradāya, the Śrī sampradāya and the Kumāra-sampradāya. If one wants to advance in spiritual power, one must receive his //mantras// from one of these bona fide //sampradāyas;// otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.

//Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the// Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, //entitled "The Nārāyaṇa-kavaca Shield."//
