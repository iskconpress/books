===== Purport =====

According to Vedic astronomical calculations, day and night are each divided into thirty //ghaṭikās// (twenty-four minutes), instead of twelve hours. Generally, each day and each night is divided into six parts consisting of five //ghaṭikās.// In each of these six portions of the day and night, the Lord may be addressed for protection according to different names. Lord Keśava, the proprietor of the holy place of Mathurā, is the Lord of the first portion of the day, and Govinda, the Lord of Vṛndāvana. is the master of the second portion.
