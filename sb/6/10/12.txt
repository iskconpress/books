===== Purport =====

The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:5|(Bg. 8.5)]]:

> anta-kāle ca mām eva
> smaran muktvā kalevaram
> yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ
> yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ

"Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt." Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect //yogī,// namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Kṛṣṇa. He does not feel his material body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti:// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]] the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again, but is transferred back home, back to Godhead. This //yoga, bhakti-yoga,// is the highest //yoga// system, as explained by the Lord Himself in //Bhagavad-gītā//  (6.47):

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." The //bhakti-yogī// always thinks of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to Kṛṣṇaloka, without even perceiving the pains of death.
