===== Purport =====

As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:6|(Bg. 4.6)]]:

> ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā
> bhūtānām īśvaro 'pi san
> prakṛtiṁ svām adhiṣṭhāya
> sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā

"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." When the Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates, He does not need any help from the external energy, for He appears as He is by His own potency. The spiritual potency is also called //māyā.// It is said, //ato māyāmayaṁ viṣṇuṁ pravadanti manīṣiṇaḥ:// the body accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called //māyāmaya.// This does not mean that He is formed of the external energy; this //māyā// refers to His internal potency.
