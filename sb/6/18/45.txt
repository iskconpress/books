**Kaśyapa Muni said: My dear gentle wife, if you follow my instructions regarding this vow for at least one year, you will surely get a son who will be able to kill Indra. However, if you deviate from this vow of following the Vaiṣṇava principles, you will get a son who will be favorable to Indra.**

===== Purport =====

The word //indra-hā// refers to an //asura// who is always eager to kill Indra. An enemy of Indra is naturally a friend to the //asuras,// but the word //indra-hā// also refers to one who follows Indra or who is obedient to him. When one becomes a devotee of Indra, he is certainly a friend to the demigods. Thus the words //indra-hādeva-bāndhavaḥ// are equivocal, for they say, "Your son will kill Indra, but he will be very friendly to the demigods." If a person actually became a friend of the demigods, he certainly would not be able to kill Indra.
