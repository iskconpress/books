**After Viśvarūpa was killed, his father, Tvaṣṭā, performed ritualistic ceremonies to kill Indra. He offered oblations in the sacrificial fire, saying, "O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your enemy without delay."**

===== Purport =====

There was some defect in Tvaṣṭā's chanting of the //mantra// because he chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed. Tvaṣṭā intended to chant the word //indra-śatro,// meaning, "O enemy of Indra." In this //mantra,// the word //indra// is in the possessive case (//ṣaṣṭhī//), and the word //indra-śatro// is called a //tat-puruṣa// compound (//tatpuruṣa-samāsa//). Unfortunately, instead of chanting the //mantra// short, Tvaṣṭā chanted it long, and its meaning changed from "the enemy of Indra" to "Indra, who is an enemy." Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra's, there emerged the body of Vṛtrāsura, of whom Indra was the enemy.
