{{description>O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Kṛṣṇa, Your reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything. This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful.

===== Purport =====

The demigods certainly wanted Lord Viṣṇu to relieve their anxiety, but now they directly approach Lord Kṛṣṇa, for although there is no difference between Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa descends to this planet in His Vāsudeva feature for the purpose of //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]---protecting His devotees and annihilating the miscreants. Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or devotees, and therefore Kṛṣṇa descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees. Kṛṣṇa, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Viṣṇu and Nārāyaṇa, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord. As explained in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.46):

> dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya
> dīpāyate vivṛta-hetu-samāna-dharmā
> yas tādṛg eva hi ca viṣṇutayā vibhāti
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

Kṛṣṇa expands Himself as Viṣṇu the way a bright candle kindles another. Although there is no difference between the power of one candle and another, Kṛṣṇa is compared to the original candle.

The word //mṛṣṭa-yaśase// is significant herein because Kṛṣṇa is always famous for relieving His devotee from danger. A devotee who has sacrificed everything for the service of Kṛṣṇa and whose only source of relief is the Lord is known as //akiñcana.//

As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kuntī, the Lord is //akiñcana-vitta,// the property of such a devotee. Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world, where they achieve five kinds of liberation---//sāyujya, sālokya, sārūpya, sārṣṭi// and //sāmīpya// [[books:cc:madhya:6:266|[Cc. Madhya 6.266]]]. They personally associate with the Lord in five mellows---//śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya// and //mādhurya.// These //rasas// are all emanations from Kṛṣṇa. As described by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the original mellow, //ādi-rasa,// is conjugal love. Kṛṣṇa is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love.
