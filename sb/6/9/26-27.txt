{{description>By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as Vāmanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Paraśurāma, the incarnation among saints; Nṛsiṁhadeva and Varāha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kūrma, incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Rāma.

===== Purport =====

In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation. Śrīdhara Svāmī, in his commentary //Bhāvārtha-dīpikā,// replies to the idea that //prakṛti// and //puruṣa// are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, //paraṁ pradhānaṁ puruṣaṁ viśvam anyam:// "He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [//virāṭ rūpa//]." The word //prakṛti,// which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word //puruṣa// refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the //prakṛti// and //puruṣa// ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām//).

Although //prakṛti// and //puruṣa// superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of //prakṛti// and //puruṣa.// He is the original cause (//sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]). The //Nāradīya Purāṇa// says:

> avikāro 'pi paramaḥ
> prakṛtis tu vikāriṇī
> anupraviśya govindaḥ
> prakṛtiś cābhidhīyate

Both the //prakṛti// and //puruṣa,// which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//gām āviśya [[books:bg:15:13|[Bg. 15.13]]]//), the Lord enters the //prakṛti,// and then the //prakṛti// creates different manifestations. The //prakṛti// is not independent or beyond His energies. Vāsudeva, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the original cause of everything. Therefore the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:8|(Bg. 10.8)]]:

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ

"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts." In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:9:33|(2.9.33)]] the Lord also says, //aham evāsam evāgre:// "Only I existed before the creation." This is confirmed in the //Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa// as follows:

> smṛtir avyavadhānena
> prakṛtitvam iti sthitiḥ
> ubhayātmaka-sūtitvād
> vāsudevaḥ paraḥ pumān
> prakṛtiḥ puruṣaś ceti
> śabdair eko 'bhidhīyate

To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the //puruṣa// and directly as the //prakṛti.// Because both energies emanate from Lord Vāsudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is known as both //prakṛti// and //puruṣa.// Therefore Vāsudeva is the cause of everything (//sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]).
