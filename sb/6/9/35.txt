===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]---to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees. These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls. When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is //apāpa-viddham;// He is never contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received //sārūpya;// in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord's position says that God is unkind to him but merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:29|(Bg. 9.29)]], //samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ:// "I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend." But He also says, //ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā mayi te teṣu cāpy aham:// "If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders unto Me, I give him special attention."
