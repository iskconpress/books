===== Purport =====

Several words in this verse are very important. The word //mahā-puruṣa// refers to advanced devotees and also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Mahā// means "the supreme," and //puruṣa// means "person." One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called //mahā-pauruṣika.// Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Mahārāja Parīkṣit are sometimes addressed as //mahā-pauruṣika.// A devotee should always aspire to engage in the service of advanced devotees. As Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:

> tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta-sane vāsa
> janame janame haya, ei abhilāṣa

A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service of the Lord through the //paramparā// system. One should serve the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu through the instructions of the great Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana. This is called //tāṅdera caraṇa sevi.// While serving the lotus feet of the Gosvāmīs, one should live in the association of devotees (//bhakta-sane vāsa//). This is the business of a devotee. A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material loss. When Aṅgirā Ṛṣi and Nārada saw that Mahārāja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance.

Another significant word is //brahmaṇya.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed by the prayer //namo brahmaṇya-devāya,// which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the devotees. Therefore this verse states, //brahmaṇyo bhagavad-bhakto nāvāsāditum arhasi.// This is the symptom of an advanced devotee. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. For a devotee---an advanced, self-realized soul---there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation. He is always transcendental to conditional life.
