===== Purport =====

The word //jñāna-hetavaḥ// is very significant because great personalities like those listed in these verses wander on the surface of the globe not to mislead the populace, but to distribute real knowledge. Without this knowledge, human life is wasted. The human form of life is meant for realization of one's relationship with Kṛṣṇa, or God. One who lacks this knowledge is categorized among the animals. The Lord Himself says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:15|(Bg. 7.15)]]:

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ

"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me."

Ignorance is the bodily conception of life (//yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke ...sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13]). Practically everyone throughout the universe, especially on this planet, Bhūrloka, thinks that there is no separate existence of the body and soul and therefore no need of self-realization. But that is not a fact. Therefore all the //brāhmaṇas// listed here, being devotees, travel all over the world to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the hearts of such foolish materialists.

The //ācāryas// mentioned in these verses are described in the //Mahābhārata.// The word //pañcaśikha// is also important. One who is liberated from the conceptions of //annamaya, prāṇamaya, manomaya, vijñānamaya// and //ānandamaya// and who is perfectly aware of the subtle coverings of the soul is called //pañcaśikha.// According to the statements of the //Mahābhārata// (//Sānti-parva,// Chapters 218-219), an //ācārya// named Pañcaśikha took birth in the family of Mahārāja Janaka, the ruler of Mithila. The Sāṅkhya philosophers accept Pañcaśikhācārya as one of them. Real knowledge pertains to the living entity dwelling within the body. Unfortunately, because of ignorance, the living entity identifies himself with the body and therefore feels pleasure and pain.
