===== Purport =====

Every Vedic //mantra// is called //brahma// because each //mantra// is preceded by the //brahmākṣara// (//aum// or //oṁkāra//). For example, //oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Lord Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā (7.8), praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu:// "In all the Vedic //mantras,// I am represented by //praṇava,// or //oṁkāra.//" hus chanting of the Vedic //mantras// beginning with //oṁkāra// is directly chanting of Kṛṣṇa's name. There is no difference. Whether one //chants oṁkāra// or addresses the Lord as "Kṛṣṇa," the meaning is the same, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended that in this age one chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// (//harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]). Although there is no difference between Hare Kṛṣṇa and the Vedic //mantras// beginning with //oṁkāra,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the leader of the spiritual movement for this age, has recommended that one chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
