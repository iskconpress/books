Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //sannyāsīra alpa chidra sarva-loke gāya// [[books:cc:madhya:12:51|(Cc. Madhya 12.51)]]. In society one will find many //sannyāsīs, vānaprasthas, gṛhasthas// and //brahmacārīs,// but if all of them properly live in accordance with their duties, they are understood to be //sādhus.// Prajāpati Dakṣa was certainly a //sādhu// because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, had appeared before him. Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality. He improperly thought Nārada Muni to be //asādhu,// or nonsaintly, because Nārada had foiled his intentions. Desiring to train his sons to become //gṛhasthas// fully equipped with knowledge, Dakṣa had sent them to execute austerities by Nārāyaṇa-saras. Nārada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vaiṣṇavas in the renounced order. This is the duty of Nārada Muni and his followers. They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead. Prajāpati Dakṣa, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties Nārada Muni performed in relation to his sons. Unable to appreciate Nārada Muni's behavior, Dakṣa accused Nārada of being //asādhu.//

The words //bhikṣor mārga,// "the path of the renounced order," are very significant in this regard. A //sannyāsī// is called //tridaṇḍi-bhikṣu// because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of //gṛhasthas// and to give the //gṛhasthas// spiritual instructions. A //sannyāsī// is allowed to beg from door to door, but a //gṛhastha// cannot do so. //Gṛhasthas// may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A //brāhmaṇa gṛhastha// may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore it is said that only //brāhmaṇas// may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as //prasāda// whatever people offer the Deity. Although a //brāhmaṇa// may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a //brāhmaṇa// does not stock anything for his future use. Similarly, //kṣatriyas// may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. //Vaiśyas// should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and //śūdras// should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes. Unless one becomes a //brāhmaṇa,// one cannot take //sannyāsa. Sannyāsīs// and //brahmacārīs// may beg alms door to door, but a //gṛhastha// cannot.

Prajāpati Dakṣa condemned Nārada Muni because Nārada, a //brahmacārī// who could beg from door to door, had made //sannyāsīs// of Dakṣa's sons, who were being trained to be //gṛhasthas.// Dakṣa was extremely angry at Nārada because he thought that Nārada had done him a great injustice. According to Dakṣa's opinion, Nārada Muni had misled Dakṣa's inexperienced sons (//asādhv akāry arbhakāṇām//). Dakṣa regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when Nārada showed them the renounced order of life. Because of all these considerations, Prajāpati Dakṣa charged that Nārada Muni was //asādhu// and should not have adopted the dress of a //sādhu.//

Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by //gṛhasthas,// especially when he instructs their young sons to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Generally a //gṛhastha// thinks that unless one enters //gṛhastha// life he cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of Nārada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We allow //gṛhastha// life, but a //gṛhastha// also follows the path of renunciation. Even a //gṛhastha// has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no's, one's life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Prajāpati Dakṣa disliked the activities of Nārada and accused Nārada of dishonesty. Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from Nārada Muni.

People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of //gṛhastha// life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They do not know that the householder's concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one's fiftieth year one must give up household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of Nārada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement immediately. There is nothing wrong in this.
