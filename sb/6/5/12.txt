**[Nārada Muni had said that there is a kingdom where there is only one male. The Haryaśvas realized the purport of this statement.] The only enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who observes everything, everywhere. He is full of six opulences and fully independent of everyone else. He is never subject to the three modes of material nature, for He is always transcendental to this material creation.

===== Purport =====

Nārada Muni had mentioned a kingdom where there is only one king with no competitor. The complete spiritual world, and specifically the cosmic manifestation, has only one proprietor or enjoyer---the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond this material manifestation. The Lord has therefore been described as //turya,// existing on the fourth platform. He has also been described as //abhava.// The word //bhava,// which means "takes birth," comes from the word //bhū,// "to be." As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:19|(Bg. 8.19)]], //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate:// the living entities in the material world must be repeatedly born and destroyed. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is neither //bhūtvā// nor //pralīyate;// He is eternal. In other words, He is not obliged to take birth like human beings or animals, which repeatedly take birth and die because of ignorance of the soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is not subjected to such changes of body, and one who thinks otherwise is considered a fool (//avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]). Nārada Muni advises that human beings not waste their time simply jumping like cats and monkeys, without real benefit. The duty of the human being is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
