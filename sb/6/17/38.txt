===== Translation =====

**Being cursed by mother Durgā [Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva], that same Citraketu accepted birth in a demoniac species of life. Although still fully equipped with transcendental knowledge and practical application of that knowledge in life, he appeared as a demon at the fire sacrifice performed by Tvaṣṭā, and thus he became famous as Vṛtrāsura.**

===== Purport =====

The word //yoni// is generally understood to mean //jāti//-family, group or species. Although Vṛtrāsura appeared in a family of demons, it is clearly said that his knowledge of spiritual life still existed. //Jñāna-vijñāna-saṁyutaḥ:// his spiritual knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge in life were not lost. Therefore it is said that even if a devotee falls down for some reason, he is still not lost.

> yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ
> ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ
> [[books:sb:1:5:17|(SB 1.5.17)]]

Once one is advanced in devotional service, his spiritual assets are never lost under any circumstances. Whatever spiritual advancement he has achieved continues. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā.// Even if a //bhakti-yogī// falls, he takes birth in a rich family or family of //brāhmaṇas,// in which he again starts devotional activities from the point where he left off. Although Vṛtrāsura was known as an //asura,// or demon, he did not lose his consciousness of Kṛṣṇa or devotional service.
