===== Translation =====

**Ordinary conditioned persons generally embrace their wives and enjoy their company in solitary places. How wonderful it is that Lord Mahādeva, although a great master of austerity, is embracing his wife openly in the midst of an assembly of great saints.**

===== Purport =====

The word //mahā-vrata-dharaḥ// indicates a //brahmacārī// who has never fallen down. Lord Śiva is counted among the best of //yogīs,// yet he embraced his wife in the midst of great saintly persons. Citraketu appreciated how great Lord Śiva was to be unaffected even in that situation. Therefore Citraketu was not an offender; he merely expressed his wonder.
