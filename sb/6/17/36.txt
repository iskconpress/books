===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that the word //śānta-dhīḥ// means //svīya-pūrva-svabhāva-smṛtyā.// When Pārvatī remembered her former behavior in cursing Citraketu, she became very much ashamed and covered her face with the skirt of her sari, admitting that she was wrong in cursing Citraketu.
