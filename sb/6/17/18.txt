As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:27|(Bg. 3.27)]]:

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate

"The bewildered soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." Actually a conditioned soul is completely under the control of material nature. Wandering here and there---always and everywhere---he is subjected to the results of his past deeds. This is carried out by the laws of nature, but one foolishly thinks himself the doer, which in fact he is not. To get free from the //karma-cakra,// the wheel of the results of one's //karma,// one should take to //bhakti-mārga//---devotional service, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the only remedy. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].
