===== Purport =====

As confirmed in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa, parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat:// whatever manifestations we experience are nothing but various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. These energies cannot create anything independently. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]]: //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.// "This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving living beings." Only under the direction of the Lord, the Supreme Person, can //prakṛti,// which is manifested in twenty-four elements, create different situations for the living entity. In the //Vedas// the Lord says:

> madīyaṁ mahimānaṁ ca
> parabrahmeti śabditam
> vetsyasy anugṛhītaṁ me
> sampraśnair vivṛtaṁ hṛdi

"Since everything is a manifestation of My energy, I am known as Parabrahman. Therefore everyone should hear from Me about My glorious activities." The Lord also says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:2|(Bg. 10.2)]], //aham ādir hi devānām:// "I am the origin of all the demigods." Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything, and no one is independent of Him. Śrīla Madhvācārya also says, //anīśa jīva-rūpeṇa:// the living entity is //anīśa,// never the controller, but is always controlled. Therefore when a living entity becomes proud of being an independent //īśvara,// or god, that is his foolishness. Such foolishness is described in the following verse.
