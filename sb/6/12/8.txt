===== Purport =====

The difference between the //suras// and the //asuras// is that the //suras// know that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the //asuras// cannot understand the supreme will of the Lord. In this fight, Vṛtrāsura is actually the //sura,// whereas Indra is the //asura.// No one can act independently; rather, everyone acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore victory and defeat come according to the results of one's //karma,// and the judgment is given by the Supreme Lord (//karmaṇā-daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]). Since we act under the control of the Supreme according to our //karma,// no one is independent, from Brahmā down to the insignificant ant. Whether we are defeated or victorious, the Supreme Lord is always victorious because everyone acts under His directions.
