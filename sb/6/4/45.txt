===== Purport =====

There are various types of incarnations or expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The expansions of His personal self, or //viṣṇu-tattva,// are called //svāṁśa// expansions, whereas the living entities, who are not //viṣṇu-tattva// but //jīva-tattva,// are called //vibhinnāṁśa,// separated expansions. Although Prajāpati Dakṣa is not on the same level as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, he is compared to them because he engages in the service of the Lord. In the service of the Personality of Godhead, it is not that Lord Brahmā is considered very great while an ordinary human being trying to preach the glories of the Lord is considered very low. There are no such distinctions. Regardless of whether materially high or materially low, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is spiritually very dear to Him. In this regard, Śrīla Madhvācārya gives this quotation from the //Tantra-nirṇaya://

> viśeṣa-vyakti-pātratvād
> brahmādyās tu vibhūtayaḥ
> tad-antaryāmiṇaś caiva
> matsyādyā vibhavāḥ smṛtāḥ

From Lord Brahmā down, all the living entities engaged in the service of the Lord are extraordinary and are called //vibhūti.// As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:41|(Bg. 10.41)]]:

> yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
> śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
> tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
> mama tejo-'ṁśa-sambhavam

"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor." A living entity especially empowered to act on behalf of the Lord is called //vibhūti,// whereas the //viṣṇu-tattva// incarnations of the Lord, such as the Matsya //avatāra// (//keśava dhṛta-mīna-śarīra jaya jagad-īśa hare//), are called //vibhava.//
