===== Translation =====

**In the womb of that girl the Pracetās all begot a son named Dakṣa, who filled the three worlds with living entities.**

===== Purport =====

Dakṣa was first born during the reign of Svāyambhuva Manu, but because of offending Lord Śiva he was punished by having the head of a goat substituted for his own head. Thus insulted, he had to give up that body, and in the sixth //manvantara,// called the Cākṣuṣa //manvantara,// he was born of the womb of Māriṣā as Dakṣa. In this connection Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura quotes this verse:

> cākṣuṣe tv antare prāpte
> prāk-sarge kāla-vidrute
> yaḥ sasarja prajā iṣṭāḥ
> sa dakṣo daiva-coditaḥ

"His previous body had been destroyed, but he, the same Dakṣa, inspired by the supreme will, created all the desired living entities in the Cākṣuṣa //manvantara.//"(//SB// 4.30.49) Thus Dakṣa regained his previous opulence and again begot thousands and millions of children to fill the three worlds.
