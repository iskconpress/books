===== Purport =====

As the Lord Himself confirms in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:15|(Bg. 8.15)]], one reaches the highest perfection when he attains the fortune of realizing the Supreme Personality of Godhead:

> mām upetya punar janma
> duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam
> nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ
> saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ

"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are //yogīs// in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection." Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement teaches one to follow the path toward the topmost perfection simply by performing devotional service.
