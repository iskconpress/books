===== Purport =====

As stated in the previous verse, //dharmaṁ bhāgavatam,// real religious principles, are //bhāgavata-dharma,// the principles described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// itself or in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the preliminary study of the //Bhāgavatam.// What are these principles? The //Bhāgavatam// says, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra:// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]] in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there are no cheating religious systems. Everything in the //Bhāgavatam// is directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The //Bhāgavatam// further says, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje:// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]] the supreme religion is that which teaches its followers how to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of experimental knowledge. Such a religious system begins with //tan-nāma-grahaṇa,// chanting of the holy name of the Lord (//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]). After chanting the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually sees the form of the Lord, the pastimes of the Lord and the transcendental qualities of the Lord. This way one fully understands the situation of the Personality of Godhead. One can come to this understanding of the Lord, how He descends into the material world, how He takes His births and what activities He performs, but one can know this only by executing devotional service. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti:// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]] simply by devotional service one can understand everything about the Supreme Lord. If one fortunately understands the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti:// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]] after giving up his material body, he no longer has to take birth in this material world. Instead, he returns home, back to Godhead. That is the ultimate perfection. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:15|(Bg. 8.15)]]:

> mām upetya punar janma
> duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam
> nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ
> saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ

"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are //yogīs// in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection."
