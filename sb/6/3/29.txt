===== Translation =====

**My dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to chant the holy name and qualities of Kṛṣṇa, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa even once, and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord Kṛṣṇa. Send me those who do not perform their duties toward Viṣṇu, which are the only duties in human life. Please bring me all such fools and rascals.**

===== Purport =====

The word //viṣṇu-kṛtyān// is very important in this verse because the purpose of human life is to please Lord Viṣṇu. //Varṇāśrama-dharma// is also meant for that purpose. As stated in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// (3.8.9):

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

Human society is meant to follow strictly the //varṇāśrama-dharma,// which divides society into four social divisions (//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//) and four spiritual divisions (//brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa//). //Varṇāśrama-dharma// easily brings one nearer to Lord Viṣṇu, who is the only true objective in human society. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]] unfortunately, however, people do not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Viṣṇu. //Durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ:// instead, they are simply bewildered. Every human being is expected to perform duties meant for approaching Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore Yamarāja advises the Yamadūtas to bring him those persons who have forgotten their duties toward Viṣṇu (//akṛta-viṣṇu-kṛtyān//). One who does not chant the holy name of Viṣṇu (Kṛṣṇa), who does not bow down to the Deity of Viṣṇu, and who does not remember the lotus feet of Viṣṇu is punishable by Yamarāja. In summary, all //avaiṣṇavas,// persons unconcerned with Lord Viṣṇu, are punishable by Yamarāja.
