===== Translation =====

**According to the rules and regulations mentioned above, one who is twice-born, namely a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya or vaiśya, should reside in the guru-kula under the care of the spiritual master. There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along with their supplements and the Upaniṣads, according to his ability and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual master requests, and then, following the master's order, the disciple should leave and accept one of the other āśramas, namely the gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama or sannyāsa-āśrama, as he desires.**

===== Purport =====

To study the //Vedas// and understand them, of course, requires some special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of society---namely the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas//---must learn the Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand. In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone but the //śūdras// and //antyajas.// The Vedic literature gives the knowledge that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth---Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān. //Guru-kula,// or the reformatory educational institution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the present time there are many educational institutions for training and technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the //śūdras,// whereas the //Vedas// are meant for the //dvijas.// Consequently this verse states, //dvijo 'dhītyāvabudhya ca trayīṁ sāṅgopaniṣadam.// At the present time, in the age of Kali, practically everyone is a //śūdra,// and no one is a //dvija.// Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated.

Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the //brahmacārī-āśrama// one may accept the //sannyāsa-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama// or //gṛhastha-āśrama.// It is not compulsory for a //brahmacārī// to become a //gṛhastha.// Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different //āśramas.// Thus one may proceed to the //sannyāsa-āśrama// directly from the //brahmacārī-āśrama.// Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura accepted the //sannyāsa-āśrama// directly from the //brahmacārī-āśrama.// In other words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura did not think it compulsory to accept the //gṛhastha-āśrama// or //vānaprastha-āśrama.//
