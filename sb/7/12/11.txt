===== Purport =====

It is sometimes misunderstood that a //gṛhastha,// a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of //gṛhastha// life. In spiritual life, whether one is a //gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsī// or //brahmacārī,// everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For //brahmacārīs// and //sannyāsīs// there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for //gṛhasthas. Gṛhasthas// should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the //guru.// Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (//guru-vṛttir vikalpena//). When the spiritual master orders, the //gṛhastha// may accept sex life. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:11|(Bg. 7.11)]]. //Dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo 'smi:// indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The //gṛhastha// is allowed to indulge in sex life during the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master's order. If the spiritual master's orders allow a //gṛhastha// to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the //gṛhastha// may do so; otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the //gṛhastha// should abstain. The //gṛhastha// must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of //garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.// Then he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A //brāhmaṇa// generally remains a //brahmacārī// throughout his entire life, but although some //brāhmaṇas// become //gṛhasthas// and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The //kṣatriya// is allowed to marry more than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a //gṛhastha// he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one's whole life under the guidance of the //guru.// Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ .// If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter. //Yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// Without the spiritual master's order, even the //gṛhastha// should not indulge in sex life.
