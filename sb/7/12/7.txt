**A brahmacārī, or one who has not accepted the gṛhastha-āśrama [family life], must rigidly avoid talking with women or about women, for the senses are so powerful that they may agitate even the mind of a sannyāsī, a member of the renounced order of life.**

===== Purport =====

//Brahmacarya// essentially means the vow not to marry but to observe strict celibacy (//bṛhad-vrata//). A //brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī// should avoid talking with women or reading literature concerning talks between man and woman. The injunction restricting association with women is the basic principle of spiritual life. Associating or talking with women is never advised in any of the Vedic literatures. The entire Vedic system teaches one to avoid sex life so that one may gradually progress from //brahmacarya// to //gṛhastha,// from //gṛhastha// to //vānaprastha,// and from //vānaprastha// to //sannyāsa// and thus give up material enjoyment, which is the original cause of bondage to this material world. The word //bṛhad-vrata// refers to one who has decided not to marry, or in other words, not to indulge in sex life throughout his entire life.
