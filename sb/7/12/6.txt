===== Purport =====

A //brahmacārī// should be very careful not to mix with women or with men addicted to women. Although when he goes out to beg alms it is necessary to talk with women and with men very much attached to women, this association should be very short, and he should talk with them only about begging alms, and not more. A //brahmacārī// should be very careful in associating with men who are attached to women.
