**By practicing in this way, whether one be in the brahmacārī-āśrama, gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama or sannyāsa-āśrama, one must always realize the all-pervading presence of the Supreme Lord, for in this way it is possible to understand the Absolute Truth.**

===== Purport =====

This is the beginning of self-realization. One must first understand how Brahman is present everywhere and how He is acting. This education is called //brahma jijñāsā// and is the real concern of human life. Without such knowledge, one cannot claim to be a human being; rather, he remains in the animal kingdom. As it is said, //sa eva go-kharaḥ:// [SB 10.84.13] without such knowledge, one is no better than a cow or an ass.
