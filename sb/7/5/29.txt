===== Purport =====

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that devotional service is actually //bhadrā satī,// not //abhadra asatī.// In other words, knowledge of devotional service can be neither inauspicious nor contrary to etiquette. To learn devotional service is the duty of everyone. Therefore the spontaneous education of Prahlāda Mahārāja is supported as auspicious and perfect.
