===== Purport =====

In this verse, Hiraṇyakaśipu inquires from his son what he has learned from his //guru.// Prahlāda Mahārāja's //gurus// were of two kinds---Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka, the sons of Śukrācārya in the seminal disciplic succession, were the //gurus// appointed by his father, but his other //guru// was the exalted Nārada Muni, who had instructed Prahlāda when Prahlāda was within the womb of his mother. Prahlāda Mahārāja responded to the inquiry of his father with the instructions he had received from his spiritual master, Nārada. Thus there was again a difference of opinion because Prahlāda Mahārāja wanted to relate the best thing he had learned from his spiritual master, whereas Hiraṇyakaśipu expected to hear about the politics and diplomacy Prahlāda had learned from Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka. Now the dissension between the father and son became increasingly intense as Prahlāda Mahārāja began to say what he had learned from his //guru// Nārada Muni.
