===== Translation =====

**The great saint Nārada Muni continued: The great soul Prahlāda Mahārāja became silent after saying this to his teachers, Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka, the seminal sons of Śukrācārya. These so-called brāhmaṇas then became angry at him. Because they were servants of Hiraṇyakaśipu, they were very sorry, and to chastise Prahlāda Mahārāja they spoke as follows.**

===== Purport =====

The word //śukra// means "semen." The sons of Śukrācārya were //brāhmaṇas// by birthright, but an actual //brāhmaṇa// is one who possesses the brahminical qualities. The //brāhmaṇas// Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka, being seminal sons of Śukrācārya, did not actually possess real brahminical qualifications, for they engaged as servants of Hiraṇyakaśipu. An actual //brāhmaṇa// is very much satisfied to see anyone, not to speak of his disciple, become a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Such //brāhmaṇas// are meant to satisfy the supreme master. A //brāhmaṇa// is strictly prohibited from becoming a servant of anyone else, for that is the business of dogs and //śūdras.// A dog must satisfy his master, but a //brāhmaṇa// does not have to satisfy anyone; he is simply meant to satisfy Kṛṣṇa (//ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]). That is the real qualification of a //brāhmaṇa.// Because Ṣaṇḍa and Amarka were seminal //brāhmaṇas// and had become servants of such a master as Hiraṇyakaśipu, they unnecessarily wanted to chastise Prahlāda Mahārāja.
