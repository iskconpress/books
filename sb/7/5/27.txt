===== Purport =====

Being anxious about the education of his boy Prahlāda, Hiraṇyakaśipu was very much dissatisfied. When Prahlāda began teaching about devotional service, Hiraṇyakaśipu immediately regarded the teachers as his enemies in the garb of friends. In this verse the words //rogaḥ pātakinām iva// refer to disease, which is the most sinful and miserable of the conditions of material life (//janma-mṛtyu jarā-vyādhi [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]//). Disease is the symptom of the body of a sinful person. The //smṛti-śāstras// say,

> brahma-hā kṣaya-rogī syāt
> surāpaḥ śyāvadantakaḥ
> svarṇa-hārī tu kunakhī
> duścarmā guru-talpagaḥ

Murderers of //brāhmaṇas// are later afflicted by tuberculosis, drunkards become toothless, those who have stolen gold are afflicted by diseased nails, and sinful men who have sexual connections with the wife of a superior are afflicted by leprosy and similar skin diseases.
