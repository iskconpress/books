===== Purport =====

Hiraṇyakaśipu considered his son Prahlāda Mahārāja to be the killer of his brother because Prahlāda Mahārāja was engaged in the devotional service of Lord Viṣṇu. In other words, Prahlāda Mahārāja would be elevated to //sārūpya// liberation, and in that sense he resembled Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore Prahlāda was to be killed by Hiraṇyakaśipu. Devotees, Vaiṣṇavas, attain the liberations of //sārūpya, sālokya, sārṣṭi// and //sāmīpya,// whereas the Māyāvādīs are supposed to attain the liberation known as //sāyujya. Sāyujya-mukti,// however, is not very secure, whereas //sārūpya-mukti, sālokya-mukti, sārṣṭi-mukti// and //sāmīpya-mukti// are most certain. Although the servants of Lord Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, in the Vaikuṇṭha planets are equally situated with the Lord, the devotees there know very well that the Lord is the master whereas they are servants.
