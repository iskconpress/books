One should give up this position and go to the forest [vana]. More clearly, one should go to Vṛndāvana, where only Kṛṣṇa consciousness is prevalent, and should thus take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.}}

**Prahlāda Mahārāja replied: O best of the asuras, King of the demons, as far as I have learned from my spiritual master, any person who has accepted a temporary body and temporary household life is certainly embarrassed by anxiety because of having fallen in a dark well where there is no water but only suffering. One should give up this position and go to the forest [vana]. More clearly, one should go to Vṛndāvana, where only Kṛṣṇa consciousness is prevalent, and should thus take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

Hiraṇyakaśipu thought that Prahlāda, being nothing but a small boy with no actual experience, might reply with something pleasing but nothing practical. Prahlāda Mahārāja, however, being an exalted devotee, had acquired all the qualities of education.

"One who has unflinching devotional faith in Kṛṣṇa consistently manifests all the good qualities of Kṛṣṇa and the demigods. However, he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence, which is the external feature of the Lord." [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]] So-called educated philosophers and scientists who are simply on the mental platform cannot distinguish between what is actually //sat,// eternal, and what is //asat,// temporary. The Vedic injunction is //asato mā jyotir gama:// everyone should give up the platform of temporary existence and approach the eternal platform. The soul is eternal, and topics concerning the eternal soul are actually knowledge. Elsewhere it is said, //apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām:// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]] those who are attached to the bodily conception of life and who thus stick to life as a //gṛhastha,// or householder, on the platform of material sense enjoyment, cannot see the welfare of the eternal soul. Prahlāda Mahārāja confirmed this by saying that if one wants success in life, he should immediately understand from the right sources what his self-interest is and how he should mold his life in spiritual consciousness. One should understand himself to be part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa and thus completely take shelter of His lotus feet for guaranteed spiritual success. Everyone in the material world is in the bodily conception, struggling hard for existence, life after life. Prahlāda Mahārāja therefore recommended that to stop this material condition of repeated birth and death, one should go to the forest (//vana//).

In the //varṇāśrama// system, one first becomes a //brahmacārī,// then a //gṛhastha,// a //vānaprastha// and finally a //sannyāsī.// Going to the forest means accepting //vānaprastha// life, which is between //gṛhastha// life and //sannyāsa.// As confirmed in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// (3.8.9), //varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate:// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]] by accepting the institution of //varṇa// and //āśrama,// one can very easily elevate himself to the platform of worshiping Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Otherwise, if one remains in the bodily conception, one must rot within this material world, and his life will be a failure. Society must have divisions of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra,// and for spiritual advancement one must gradually develop as a //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsī.// Prahlāda Mahārāja recommended that his father accept //vānaprastha// life because as a //gṛhastha// he was becoming increasingly demoniac due to bodily attachment. Prahlāda recommended to his father that accepting //vānaprastha// life would be better than going deeper and deeper into //gṛham andha-kūpam,// the blind well of life as a //gṛhastha.// In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we therefore invite all the elderly persons of the world to come to Vṛndāvana and stay there in retired life, making advancement in spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
