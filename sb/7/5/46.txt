===== Purport =====

The word //śunaḥ// means "of a dog," and //śepa// means "tail." The example is ordinary. However one may try to straighten a dog's tail, it is never straight but always curved. //Śunaḥ śepa// is also the name of the second son of Ajīgarta. He was sold to Hariścandra, but he later took shelter of Viśvāmitra, Hariścandra's enemy, and never left his side.
