===== Purport =====

There are four processes for human society---//dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa//---and they culminate in liberation. Human society must follow a process of religion to advance, and on the basis of religion one should try to develop his economic condition so that he can fulfill his needs for sense gratification according to the religious rules and regulations. Then liberation from material bondage will be easier to attain. That is the Vedic process. When one is above the stages of //dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa,// one becomes a devotee. He is then on the platform from which he is guaranteed not to fall again to material existence (//yad gatvā na nivartante [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]//). As advised in //Bhagavad-gītā// if one transcends these four processes and is actually liberated, one engages in devotional service. Then he is guaranteed not to fall to material existence again.
