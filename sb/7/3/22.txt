===== Purport =====

Lord Brahmā is the first created being within this universe and is empowered by the Supreme Lord to create. //Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye:// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]] the //ādi deva,// or //ādi-kavi//---the first living creature---was personally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the heart. There was no one to teach him, but since the Lord is situated within Brahmā's heart, Brahmā was educated by the Lord Himself. Lord Brahmā, being especially empowered, is infallible in doing whatever he wants. This is the meaning of the word //amogha rādhasā.// He desired to restore Hiraṇyakaśipu's original body, and therefore, by sprinkling transcendental water from his waterpot, he immediately did so.
