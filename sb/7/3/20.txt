===== Purport =====

In regard to the word //jitaḥ,// Śrīla Madhva Muni gives the following quotation from the //Śabda-nirṇaya: parābhūtaṁ vaśa-sthaṁ ca jitabhid ucyate budhaiḥ.// "If one comes under someone else's control or is defeated by another, he is called //jitaḥ.//" iraṇyakaśipu's austerity was so great and wonderful that even Lord Brahmā agreed to be conquered by him.
