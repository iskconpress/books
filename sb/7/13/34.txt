Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern demoniac civilization. Vedic civilization concerned itself with how to achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was recommended to have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was divided into //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras,// and the members of this society would limit their endeavors to meeting their minimum demands. The //brāhmaṇas,// in particular, would have no material desires. Because the //kṣatriyas// had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to have money and prestige. But the //vaiśyas// were satisfied with agricultural produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess, trade was allowed. The //śūdras// were also happy, for they would get food and shelter from the three higher classes. In the demoniac civilization of the present day, however, there is no question of //brāhmaṇas// or //kṣatriyas;// there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile class who have no goal in life.

According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take //sannyāsa,// but at the present moment people do not know why //sannyāsa// is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one accepts //sannyāsa// to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept //sannyāsa// to escape from responsibility to society. Generally one accepts //sannyāsa// at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as a //brahmacārī// then becomes a //gṛhastha,// a //vānaprastha// and finally a //sannyāsī// to take advantage of the duration of one's life by engaging oneself fully in self-realization. //Sannyāsa// does not mean begging from door to door to accumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga people are more or less prone to sense gratification, immature //sannyāsa// is not recommended. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in his //Nectar of Instruction//:

> atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca

"One's devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters; (4) practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements." A //sannyāsī// should have an institution meant to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness; he need not accumulate money for himself. We recommend that as soon as money accumulates in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it should be invested in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures, especially in establishing centers all over the world. The managers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard to this point. Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, material attachment, material poverty, and unnecessary hard work. When I was alone in Vṛndāvana, I never attempted to construct //maṭhās// or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small amount of money I could gather by selling //Back to Godhead,// and thus I would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when Europeans and Americans began to give money profusely, I started temples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed. Whatever money is collected should be spent for Kṛṣṇa, and not a farthing for sense gratification. This is the //Bhāgavata// principle.
