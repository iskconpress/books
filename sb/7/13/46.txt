**Nārada Muni continued: After Prahlāda Mahārāja, the King of the demons, heard these instructions from the saint, he understood the occupational duties of a perfect person [paramahaṁsa]. Thus he duly worshiped the saint, took his permission and then left for his own home.**

===== Purport =====

As quoted in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|(Madhya 8.128)]], Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said:

> kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei 'guru' haya

A //guru,// or spiritual master, can be anyone who is well conversant with the science of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore although Prahlāda Mahārāja was a //gṛhastha// ruling over the demons, he was a //paramahaṁsa,// the best of human beings, and thus he is our //guru.// In the list of //gurus,// or authorities, Prahlāda Mahārāja's name is therefore mentioned:

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam

The conclusion is that a //paramahaṁsa// is an exalted devotee (//bhagavat-priya//). Such a //paramahaṁsa// may be in any stage of life---//brahmacāri, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// or //sannyāsa//---and be equally liberated and exalted.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Behavior of a Perfect Person."
