**My dear King, although you know everything, you have posed some questions, which I shall try to answer according to what I have learned by hearing from authorities. I cannot remain silent in this regard, for a personality like you is just fit to be spoken to by one who desires self-purification.**

===== Purport =====

A saintly person doesn't wish to speak to anyone and everyone, and he is therefore grave and silent. Generally a common man does not need to be advised. Unless one is prepared to take instructions, it is said that a saintly person should not address him, although sometimes, because of great kindness, a saintly person speaks to ordinary men. As for Prahlāda Mahārāja, however, since he was not a common, ordinary man, whatever questions he posed would have to be answered, even by a great and exalted personality. Therefore the saintly //brāhmaṇa// did not remain silent, but began to answer. These answers, however, were not concocted by him. This is indicated by the words //yathā-śrutam,// meaning "as I have heard from the authorities." In the //paramparā// system, when the questions are bona fide the answers are bona fide. No one should attempt to create or manufacture answers. One must refer to the //śāstras// and give answers according to Vedic understanding. The words //yathā-śrutam// refer to Vedic knowledge. The //Vedas// are known as //śruti// because this knowledge is received from authorities. The statements of the //Vedas// are known as //śruti-pramāṇa.// One should quote evidence from the //śruti//---the //Vedas// or Vedic literature---and then one's statements will be correct. Otherwise one's words will proceed from mental concoction.
