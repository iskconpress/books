Prahlāda Mahārāja studied the bodily features of the saintly person, and through the saint's physiognomy Prahlāda Mahārāja could understand that he was intelligent and expert, although he was lying down and not doing anything. Prahlāda was naturally inquisitive about why he was lying there inactive.
