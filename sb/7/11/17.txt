===== Translation =====

**Except in a time of emergency, lower persons should not accept the occupational duties of those who are higher. When there is such an emergency, of course, everyone but the kṣatriya may accept the means of livelihood of others.**

===== Purport =====

The occupational duty of a //brāhmaṇa// should not be accepted by persons in lower social orders, especially //vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// For example, an occupational duty of the //brāhmaṇa// is to teach Vedic knowledge, but unless there is an emergency, this professional duty should not be accepted by the //kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// or //śūdras.// Even a //kṣatriya// cannot accept the duties of a //brāhmaṇa// unless there is an emergency, and then even if he does so he should not accept charity from anyone else. Sometimes //brāhmaṇas// protest against our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for creating //brāhmaṇas// from Europeans, or, in other words, from //mlecchas// and //yavanas.// This movement, however, is here supported in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// At the present moment, society is in a chaotic condition, and everyone has given up the cultivation of spiritual life, which is especially meant for the //brāhmaṇas.// Because spiritual culture has been stopped all over the world, there is now an emergency, and therefore it is now time to train those who are considered lower and condemned, so that they may become //brāhmaṇas// and take up the work of spiritual progress. The spiritual progress of human society has been stopped, and this should be considered an emergency. Here is solid support from Nārada Muni of the movement known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
