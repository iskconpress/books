===== Purport =====

Herein it is clearly stated by Nārada Muni that one should not be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra// according to birth, for although this is going on now, it is not accepted by the //śāstras.// As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]], //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.// Thus the four divisions of society---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//---are to be ascertained according to qualities and activities. If one was born in a //brāhmaṇa// family and has acquired the brahminical qualifications, he is to be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa;// otherwise, he should be considered a //brahma-bandhu.// Similarly, if a //śūdra// acquires the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa,// although he was born in a //śūdra// family, he is not a //śūdra;// because he has developed the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa,// he should be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa.// The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regardless of the community in which one was born, if one develops the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa// he should be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa,// and he then may be offered the order of //sannyāsa.// Unless one is qualified in terms of the brahminical symptoms, one cannot take //sannyāsa.// In designating a person a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// or //śūdra,// birth is not the essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein Nārada Muni distinctly says that one may be accepted according to the caste of his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but otherwise he should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a //brāhmaṇa,// regardless of where he was born, should be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa.// Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a //śūdra// or a //caṇḍāla,// regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes."
