===== Purport =====

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains the position of //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// as follows. //Brāhmaṇas// have six occupational duties, of which three are compulsory---namely, studying the //Vedas,// worshiping the Deity and giving charity. By teaching, by inducing others to worship the Deity, and by accepting gifts, the //brāhmaṇas// receive the necessities of life. This is also confirmed in the //Manu-saṁhitā://

> ṣaṇṇāṁ tu karmaṇām asya
> trīṇi karmāṇi jīvikā
> yajanādhyāpane caiva
> viśuddhāc ca pratigrahaḥ

Of the six occupational duties of the //brāhmaṇas,// three are compulsory---namely, worship of the Deity, study of the //Vedas// and the giving of charity. In exchange, a //brāhmaṇa// should receive charity, and this should be his means of livelihood. A //brāhmaṇa// cannot take up any professional occupational duty for his livelihood. The //śāstras// especially stress that if one claims to be a //brāhmaṇa,// he cannot engage in the service of anyone else; otherwise he at once falls from his position and becomes a //śūdra.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī belonged to a very respectful family, but because they engaged in the service of Nawab Hussain Shah---not even as ordinary clerks, but as ministers---they were ostracized from brahminical society. Indeed, they became like Mohammedans and even changed their names. Unless a //brāhmaṇa// is very pure, he cannot accept charity from others. Charity should be given to those who are pure. Even if one is born in a family of //brāhmaṇas,// if one acts as a //śūdra// one cannot accept charity, for this is strictly prohibited. Although the //kṣatriyas// are almost as qualified as the //brāhmaṇas,// even they cannot accept charity. This is strictly prohibited in this verse by the word //apratigraha.// What to speak of the lower social orders, even the //kṣatriyas// must not accept charity. The king or government may levy taxes upon the citizens in various ways---by revenue duties, customs duties, realization of fines, and so on---provided the king is able to give full protection to his subjects to assure the security of their life and property. Unless he is able to give protection, he cannot levy taxes. However, a king must not levy any tax upon the //brāhmaṇas// and the Vaiṣṇavas fully engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
