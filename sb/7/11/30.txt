===== Purport =====

The four principal divisions of society---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//---have been defined, and now there is a description of the //antyaja,// the mixed classes. Among the mixed classes, there are two divisions---//pratilomaja// and //anulomaja.// If a woman of a high caste marries a man of a lower caste, their union is called //pratiloma.// If a woman of a low caste, however, marries a man of a higher caste, their union is called //anuloma.// The members of such dynasties have their traditional duties as barbers, washermen and so on. Among the //antyajas,// those who are still somewhat pure in that they do not steal and are not addicted to meat-eating, drinking, illicit sex and gambling are called //antevasāyī.// Among people of the lower classes, intermarriage and the drinking of wine are allowed, for these people do not recognize such conduct as sinful among themselves.
