{{description>In time of emergency, one may accept any of the various types of professions known as ṛta, amṛta, mṛta, pramṛta and satyānṛta, but one should not at any time accept the profession of a dog. The profession of uñchaśila, collecting grains from the field, is called ṛta. Collecting without begging is called amṛta, begging grains is called mṛta, tilling the ground is called pramṛta, and trade is called satyānṛta. Engaging in the service of low-grade persons, however, is called śva-vṛtti, the profession of the dogs. Specifically, brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas should not engage in the low and abominable service of śūdras. Brāhmaṇas should be well acquainted with all the Vedic knowledge, and kṣatriyas should be well acquainted with the worship of demigods.}}

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]], //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:// the four divisions of human society were created by the Supreme Lord according to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them. Formerly, the principle of dividing human society into four sections---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra//---was strictly followed, but because of gradual neglect of the //varṇāśrama// principles, //varṇa-saṅkara// population developed, and the entire institution has now been lost. In this age of Kali, practically everyone is a //śūdra// (//kalau śūdra-sambhavāḥ//), and finding anyone who is a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// is very difficult. Although the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is a movement of //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas, it is trying to reestablish the divine //varṇāśrama// institution, for without this division of society there cannot be peace and prosperity anywhere.
