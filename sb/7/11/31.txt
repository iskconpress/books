===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:35|(Bg. 3.35)]] it is said, //śreyān sva-dharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt svanuṣṭhitāt:// "It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though they may be faulty, than another's duties." The //antyajas,// the men of the lower classes, are accustomed to stealing, drinking and illicit sex, but that is not considered sinful. For example, if a tiger kills a man, this is not sinful but if a man kills another man, this is considered sinful, and the killer is hanged. What is a daily affair among the animals is a sinful act in human society. Thus according to the symptoms of higher and lower sections of society, there are different varieties of occupational duties. According to the experts in Vedic knowledge, these duties are prescribed in terms of the age concerned.
