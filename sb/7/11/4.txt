===== Purport =====

Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja knew that Nārada Muni is the supreme spiritual master of human society who can teach the path of spiritual liberation leading to the understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, it is for this purpose that Nārada Muni compiled his //Bhakti-sūtra// and gave directions in the //Nārada-pañcarātra.// To learn about religious principles and the perfection of life, one must take instruction from the disciplic succession of Nārada Muni. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is directly in the line of the Brahma-sampradāya. Nārada Muni received instructions from Lord Brahmā and in turn transmitted the instructions to Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva instructed his son Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who spoke //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Bhagavad-gītā.// Because //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī and //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken by Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference between them. If we strictly follow the principle of disciplic succession, we are certainly on the right path of spiritual liberation, or eternal engagement in devotional service.
