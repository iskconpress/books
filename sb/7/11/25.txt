===== Purport =====

It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow the vow of her husband. Any disagreement with the husband's vow will disrupt family life. In this regard, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita gives a very valuable instruction: //dampatyoḥ kalaho nāsti tatra śrīḥ svayam āgatāḥ.// When there are no fights between husband and wife, the goddess of fortune automatically comes to the home. A woman's education should be conducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a chaste woman is to be always favorably disposed toward her husband. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:1:40|(Bg. 1.40)]] it is said, //strīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya jāyate varṇa-saṅkaraḥ:// if the women are polluted, there will be //varṇa-saṅkara// population. In modern terms, the //varṇa-saṅkara// are the hippies, who do not follow any regulative injunctions. Another explanation is that when the population is //varṇa-saṅkara,// no one can know who is on what platform. The //varṇāśrama// system scientifically divides society into four //varṇas// and four //āśramas,// but in //varṇa-saṅkara// society there are no such distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one can distinguish between a //brāhmaṇa,// a //kṣatriya,// a //vaiśya// and a //śūdra.// For peace and happiness in the material world, the //varṇāśrama// institution must be introduced. The symptoms of one's activities must be defined, and one must be educated accordingly. Then spiritual advancement will automatically be possible.
