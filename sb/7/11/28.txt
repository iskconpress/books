===== Purport =====

According to the injunction of Yājñavalkya, an authority on religious principles, //āśuddheḥ sampratikṣyo hi mahāpātaka-dūṣitaḥ.// One is considered contaminated by the reactions of great sinful activities when one has not been purified according to the methods of the //daśa-vidhā-saṁskāra.// In //Bhagavad-gītā,// however, the Lord says, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ:// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]] "Those miscreants who do not surrender unto Me are the lowest of mankind." The word //narādhama// means "nondevotee." Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said, //yei bhaje sei baḍa, abhakta-hīna// [[books:cc:antya:4:67|[Cc. Antya 4.67]]],// chāra.// Anyone who is a devotee is sinless. One who is not a devotee, however, is the most fallen and condemned. It is recommended, therefore, that a chaste wife not associate with a fallen husband. A fallen husband is one who is addicted to the four principles of sinful activity---namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Specifically, if one is not a soul surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is understood to be contaminated. Thus a chaste woman is advised not to agree to serve such a husband. It is not that a chaste woman should be like a slave while her husband is //narādhama,// the lowest of men. Although the duties of a woman are different from those of a man, a chaste woman is not meant to serve a fallen husband. If her husband is fallen, it is recommended that she give up his association. Giving up the association of her husband does not mean, however, that a woman should marry again and thus indulge in prostitution. If a chaste woman unfortunately marries a husband who is fallen, she should live separately from him. Similarly, a husband can separate himself from a woman who is not chaste according to the description of the //śāstra.// The conclusion is that a husband should be a pure Vaiṣṇava and that a woman should be a chaste wife with all the symptoms described in this regard. Then both of them will be happy and make spiritual progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
