===== Purport =====

Everyone is sure to die, for no one is excused from the hands of death, which is but a feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]). When one becomes a devotee, however, he is not destined to die according to a limited duration of life. Everyone has a limited duration of life, but a devotee's lifetime can be extended by the mercy of the Supreme Lord, who is able to nullify the results of one's //karma. Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ// [Bs. 5.54]. This is the statement of //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.54). A devotee is not under the laws of //karma.// Therefore even a devotee's scheduled death can be avoided by the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord. God protects the devotee even from the extreme danger of death.
