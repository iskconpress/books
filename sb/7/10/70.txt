===== Translation =====

**The Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, appeared as a human being, yet He performed many uncommon and wonderful pastimes by His own potency. How can I say more about His activities than what has already been said by great saintly persons? Everyone can be purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the right source.**

===== Purport =====

//Bhagavad-gītā// and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, appears in human society as an ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the well-being of the entire world. One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being. Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that Kṛṣṇa is everything (//vāsudevaḥ samam iti//). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if one studies the entire //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, Kṛṣṇa is very easy to understand. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just trying to make Kṛṣṇa known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]). If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Prahlāda, the Best Among Exalted Devotees."
