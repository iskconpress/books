===== Purport =====

//Vairānubandhena.// Acting like the Lord's enemy is also beneficial for the living entity. //Kāmād dveṣād bhayāt snehād.// Whether in lusty desire, anger, fear or envy of the Lord, somehow or other, as recommended by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (//tasmāt kenāpy upāyena// [[books:sb:7:1:32|[SB 7.1.32]]]), one should become attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and ultimately achieve the goal of returning home, back to Godhead. What, then, is to be said of one who is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover?
