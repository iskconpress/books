**My dear child, your father has already been purified just by the touch of My body at the time of his death.

===== Purport =====

In this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that although Hiraṇyakaśipu was already purified, he had to take birth on a higher planetary system to become a devotee again. Prahlāda Mahārāja was advised to perform the ritualistic ceremony as a matter of etiquette, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead under no circumstances wants to stop the regulative principles. Madhva Muni also instructs:

> madhu-kaiṭabhau bhakty-abhāvā
> dūrau bhagavato mṛtau
> tama eva kramād āptau
> bhaktyā ced yo hariṁ yayau

When the demons Madhu and Kaiṭabha were killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, their kinsmen also observed the ritualistic ceremonies so that these demons could return home, back to Godhead.
