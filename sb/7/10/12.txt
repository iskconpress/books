===== Purport =====

When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of his fruitive activities. A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself. Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the Lord. A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such //karma.// Rather, a devotee knows that //karma-kāṇḍa// is meant for the less intelligent man. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says in his //prema-bhakti-candrikā, karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa:// both //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa//-fruitive activities and speculation about the Supreme Lord---are like pots of poison. One who is attracted to //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa// spoils his existence as a human being. Therefore a devotee is never interested in //karma-kāṇḍa// or //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// but is simply interested in favorable service to the Lord (//ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]), or cultivation of spiritual activities in devotional service.
