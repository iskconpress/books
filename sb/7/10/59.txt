===== Purport =====

The //asuras// are generally extremely powerful because of their mystic yogic power. However, as Lord Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]]:

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." The actual purpose of mystic //yoga// is to concentrate one's attention fully on the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and always think of Him (//mad-gatenāntarātmanā//). To attain such perfection, one must undergo a certain process---//haṭha-yoga//---and through this //yoga// system the practitioner achieves some uncommon mystic power. The //asuras,// however, instead of becoming devotees of Kṛṣṇa, utilize this mystic power for their personal sense gratification. Maya Dānava, for example, is mentioned here as //mahā-yogī,// a great mystic, but his business was to help the //asuras.// Nowadays we are actually seeing that there are some //yogīs// who cater to the senses of materialists, and there are imposters who advertise themselves as God. Maya Dānava was such a person, a god among the demons, and he could perform some wonderful feats, one of which is described here: he made a well filled with nectar and dipped the //asuras// into that nectarean well. This nectar was known as //mṛta-sanjīvayitari,// for it could bring a dead body to life. //Mṛta-sanjīvayitari// is also an Āyur-vedic preparation. It is a kind of liquor that invigorates even a person on the verge of death.
