===== Purport =====

As we have already mentioned, Śrīla Advaita Ācārya, during the generally observed ceremony to offer oblations to the forefathers, invited only Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Thus He followed this principle: //na me'bhaktaś catur-vedī mad-bhaktaḥ śva-pacaḥ priyaḥ.// The Lord says, "It is not necessary that one become very expert in Vedic knowledge before he can become My //bhakta,// or devotee. Even if one is born in a family of dog-eaters, he can become My devotee and be very dear to Me, in spite of having taken birth in such a family. Therefore, offerings should be given to My devotee, and whatever My devotee has offered Me should be accepted." Following this principle, one should invite a first-class //brāhmaṇa// or Vaiṣṇava---a realized soul---and feed him while observing the //śrāddha// ceremony to offer oblations to one's forefathers.
