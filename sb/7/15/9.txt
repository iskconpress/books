They may give up the process of ritualistic ceremonies.**

===== Purport =====

People are generally very much interested in //karma-kāṇḍa// ritualistic ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary systems, but when one awakens his spiritual knowledge, he becomes uninterested in such elevation and engages himself fully in //jñāna-yajña// to find the objective of life. The objective of life is to stop completely the miseries of birth and death and to return home, back to Godhead. When one cultivates knowledge for this purpose, he is considered to be on a higher platform than one who is engaged in //karma-yajña,// or fruitive activities.
