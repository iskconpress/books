===== Purport =====

Here is a statement exalting a Vaiṣṇava. In human society, a //brāhmaṇa// is the most respected person. A //brāhmaṇa// is one who can understand Brahman, the impersonal Brahman, but hardly ever can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described by Arjuna in //Bhagavad-gītā// as //paraṁ brahma.// A //brāhmaṇa// may be extremely fortunate in having achieved //brahma jñāna,// but the Pāṇḍavas were so exalted that the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was living in their house like an ordinary human being. The word //bhūri-bhāgāḥ// indicates that the Pāṇḍavas were in a still higher position than //brahmacārīs// and //brāhmaṇas.// In the following verses, Nārada Muni repeatedly glorifies the position of the Pāṇḍavas.
