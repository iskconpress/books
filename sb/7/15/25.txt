===== Purport =====

Just by treating the root cause of an ailment, one can conquer all bodily pains and sufferings. Similarly, if one is devoted and faithful to the spiritual master, he can conquer the influence of //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// very easily. //Yogīs// and //jñānīs// practice in many ways to conquer the senses, but the //bhakta// immediately attains the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the mercy of the spiritual master. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo .// If the spiritual master is favorably inclined, one naturally receives the mercy of the Supreme Lord, and by the mercy of the Supreme Lord one immediately becomes transcendental, conquering all the influences of //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// within this material world. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]). If one is a pure devotee acting under the directions of the //guru,// one easily gets the mercy of the Supreme Lord and thus becomes immediately situated on the transcendental platform. This is explained in the next verse.
