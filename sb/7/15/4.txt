**If one arranges to feed many brāhmaṇas or relatives during the śrāddha ceremony, there will be discrepancies in the time, place, respectability and ingredients, the person to be worshiped, and the method of offering worship.**

===== Purport =====

Nārada Muni has prohibited unnecessarily gorgeous arrangements to feed relatives or //brāhmaṇas// during the //śrāddha// ceremony. Those who are materially opulent spend lavishly during this ceremony. Indians spend especially lavishly on three occasions---at the birth of a child, at marriage and while observing the //śrāddha// ceremony---but the //śāstras// prohibit the excessive expenditures involved in inviting many //brāhmaṇas// and relatives, especially during the //śrāddha// ceremony.
