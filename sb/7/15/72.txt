===== Translation =====

**Nārada Muni continued: Being invited to that festival, I also joined, and, surrounded by women, I began musically singing the glories of the demigods. Because of this, the prajāpatis, the great demigods in charge of the affairs of the universe, forcefully cursed me with these words: "Because you have committed an offense, may you immediately become a śūdra, devoid of beauty."**

===== Purport =====

As far as //kīrtana// is concerned, the //śāstras// say, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ:// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]] one should chant the glories of the Supreme Lord and the holy name of the Supreme Lord. This is clearly stated. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ:// one should chant about and glorify Lord Viṣṇu, not any demigod. Unfortunately, there are foolish persons who invent some process of //kīrtana// on the basis of a demigod's name. This is an offense. //Kīrtana// means glorifying the Supreme Lord, not any demigod. Sometimes people invent //kālī-kīrtana// or //śiva-kīrtana,// and even big //sannyāsīs// in the Māyāvāda school say that one may chant any name and still get the same result. But here we find that millions and millions of years ago, when Nārada Muni was a Gandharva, he neglected the order to glorify the Lord, and being mad in the association of women, he began to chant otherwise. Thus he was cursed to become a //śūdra.// His first offense was that he went to join the //saṅkīrtana// party in the company of lusty women, and another offense was that he considered ordinary songs, like cinema songs and other such songs, to be equal to //saṅkīrtana.// For this offense he was punished with becoming a //śūdra.//
