===== Purport =====

This instruction is given for men in all statuses of life. Generally society is divided into //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, brahmacārīs, vānaprasthas, sannyāsīs// and //gṛhasthas.// Everyone must act according to his position and try to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for that will make one's life successful. This was instructed in Naimiṣāraṇya:

> ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā
> varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ
> svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya
> saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam

"O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties [//dharma//] according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari." [[books:sb:1:2:13|(SB 1.2.13)]] Everyone should act according to his occupational duties just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then everyone will be happy.
