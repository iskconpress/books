===== Purport =====

//Brahma-sukha-spṛṣṭam// is also described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]]:

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām

"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward every living entity. In this situation, he begins transcendental activities, or devotional service to the Lord." Generally, once elevated to the transcendental platform of //brahma-sukha,// transcendental bliss, one never comes down. But if one does not engage in devotional service, there is a chance of his returning to the material platform. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ:// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]] one may rise to the platform of //brahma-sukha,// transcendental bliss, but even from that platform one may fall down to the material platform if he does not engage himself in devotional service.
