**A person desiring liberation for his forefathers or himself should give charity to a brāhmaṇa who adheres to impersonal monism [jñāna-niṣṭhā]. In the absence of such an advanced brāhmaṇa, charity may be given to a brāhmaṇa addicted to fruitive activities [karma-kāṇḍa].**

===== Purport =====

There are two processes by which to get free from material bondage. One involves //jñāna-kāṇḍa// and //karma-kāṇḍa,// and the other involves //upāsanā-kāṇḍa.// Vaiṣṇavas never want to merge into the existence of the Supreme; rather, they want to be everlastingly servants of the Lord to render loving service unto Him. In this verse the words //ānantyam icchatā// refer to persons who desire to achieve liberation from material bondage and merge into the existence of the Lord. Devotees, however, whose objective is to associate personally with the Lord, have no desire to accept the activities of //karma-kāṇḍa// or //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// for pure devotional service is above both //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.1.11]. In pure devotional service there is not even a pinch of //jñāna// or //karma.// Consequently, when Vaiṣṇavas distribute charity, they do not need to find a //brāhmaṇa// performing the activities of //jñāna-kāṇḍa// or //karma-kāṇḍa.// The best example in this regard is provided by Advaita Gosvāmī, who, after performing the //śrāddha// ceremony for his father, offered charity to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, although it was known to everyone that Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Mohammedan family, not a //brāhmaṇa// family, and was not interested in the activities of //jñāna-kāṇḍa// or //karma-kāṇḍa.//

Charity, therefore, should be given to the first-class transcendentalist, the devotee, because the //śāstras// recommend:

> muktānām api siddhānāṁ
> nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇaḥ
> sudurlabhaḥ praśāntātmā
> koṭiṣv api mahā-mune

"O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare." [[books:sb:6:14:5|(SB 6.14.5)]] A Vaiṣṇava is in a higher position than a //jñānī,// and therefore Advaita Ācārya selected Haridāsa Ṭhākura to be the person to accept His charity. The Supreme Lord also says:

> na me 'bhaktaś catur-vedī
> mad-bhaktaḥ śva-pacaḥ priyaḥ
> tasmai deyaṁ tato grāhyaṁ
> sa ca pūjyo yathā hy aham

"Even though a person is a very learned scholar of the Sanskrit Vedic literatures, he is not accepted as My devotee unless he is pure in devotional service. However, even though a person is born in a family of dog-eaters, he is very dear to Me if he is a pure devotee who has no motive to enjoy fruitive activity or mental speculation. Indeed, all respect should be given to him, and whatever he offers should be accepted. Such devotees are as worshipable as I am." (//Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// 10.127) Therefore, even if not born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, a devotee, because of his devotion to the Lord, is above all kinds of //brāhmaṇas,// whether they be //karma-kāṇḍīs// or //jñāna-kāṇḍīs.//

In this regard, it may be mentioned that //brāhmaṇas// in Vṛndāvana who are //karma-kāṇḍīs// and //jñāna-kāṇḍīs// sometimes decline to accept invitations to our temple because our temple is known as the //aṅgarejī// temple, or "Anglican temple." But in accordance with the evidence given in the //śāstra// and the example set by Advaita Ācārya, we give //prasāda// to devotees regardless of whether they come from India, Europe or America. It is the conclusion of the //śāstra// that instead of feeding many //jñāna-kāṇḍī// or //karma-kāṇḍī brāhmaṇas,// it is better to feed a pure Vaiṣṇava, regardless of where he comes from. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:30|(Bg. 9.30)]]:

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ

"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated." Thus it doesn't matter whether a devotee comes from a //brāhmaṇa// family or non-//brāhmaṇa// family; if he is fully devoted to Kṛṣṇa, he is a //sādhu.//
