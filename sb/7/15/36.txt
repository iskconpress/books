===== Translation =====

**One who accepts the sannyāsa order gives up the three principles of materialistic activities in which one indulges in the field of household life---namely religion, economic development and sense gratification. One who first accepts sannyāsa but then returns to such materialistic activities is to be called a vāntāśī, or one who eats his own vomit. He is indeed a shameless person.**

===== Purport =====

Materialistic activities are regulated by the institution of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Without //varṇāśrama-dharma,// materialistic activities constitute animal life. Yet even in human life, while observing the principles of //varṇa// and //āśrama-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa//---one must ultimately accept //sannyāsa,// the renounced order, for only by the renounced order can one be situated in //brahma-sukha,// or transcendental bliss. In //brahma-sukha// one is no longer attracted by lusty desires. Indeed, when one is no longer disturbed, especially by lusty desires for sexual indulgence, he is fit to become a //sannyāsī.// Otherwise, one should not accept the //sannyāsa// order. If one accepts //sannyāsa// at an immature stage, there is every possibility of his being attracted by women and lusty desires and thus again becoming a so-called //gṛhastha// or a victim of women. Such a person is most shameless, and he is called //vāntāśī,// or one who eats that which he has already vomited. He certainly leads a condemned life. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement it is advised, therefore, that the //sannyāsīs// and //brahmacārīs// keep strictly aloof from the association of women so that there will be no chance of their falling down again as victims of lusty desires.
