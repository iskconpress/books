===== Purport =====

Here the Vedic aphorism //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma// is explained. It is also explained in the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]. //Aham evāsam evāgre.// The Supreme Lord existed in the beginning, He exists after the creation and maintains everything, and after destruction everything merges in Him, as stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām//). Thus the Supreme Lord is actually everything. In the conditioned state, we are bewildered in our understanding, but in the perfect stage of liberation we can understand that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of everything.

"Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." (Bs. 5.1) This is the perfection of knowledge.
