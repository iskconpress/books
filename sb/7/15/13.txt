===== Purport =====

To create a new type of //dharma// has become fashionable in this age. So-called //svāmīs// and //yogīs// support that one may follow any type of religious system, according to one's own choice, because all systems are ultimately the same. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// however, such fashionable ideas are called //vidharma// because they go against one's own religious system. The real religious system is described by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. The real religious system is that of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord. In the Sixth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in connection with Ajāmila's deliverance, Yamarāja says, //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam:// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]] real religion is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as real law is that which is given by the government. No one can manufacture actual law at home, nor can one manufacture actual religion. Elsewhere it is said, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje:// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]] the real religious system is that which leads one to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, anything opposed to this religious system of progressive Kṛṣṇa consciousness is called //vidharma, para-dharma, upadharma// or //chala-dharma.// Misinterpretation of //Bhagavad-gītā// is //chala-dharma.// When Kṛṣṇa directly says something and some rascal interprets it to mean something different, this is //chala-dharma//---a religious system of cheating---or //śabda-bhit,// a jugglery of words. One should be extremely careful to avoid these various types of cheating systems of religion.
