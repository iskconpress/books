{{description>While continuously staring at the tip of the nose, a learned yogī practices the breathing exercises through the technical means known as pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka—controlling inhalation and exhalation and then stopping them both. In this way the yogī restricts his mind from material attachments and gives up all mental desires. As soon as the mind, being defeated by lusty desires, drifts toward feelings of sense gratification, the yogī should immediately bring it back and arrest it within the core of his heart.}}

===== Translation =====

**While continuously staring at the tip of the nose, a learned yogī practices the breathing exercises through the technical means known as pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka---controlling inhalation and exhalation and then stopping them both. In this way the yogī restricts his mind from material attachments and gives up all mental desires. As soon as the mind, being defeated by lusty desires, drifts toward feelings of sense gratification, the yogī should immediately bring it back and arrest it within the core of his heart.**

===== Purport =====

The practice of //yoga// is concisely explained herein. When this practice of //yoga// is perfect, one sees the Supersoul, the Paramātmā feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within the core of one's heart. However, in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]] the Supreme Lord says:

> yoginām api sarveṣām
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." A devotee can immediately become a perfect //yogī// because he practices keeping Kṛṣṇa constantly within the core of his heart. This is another way to practice //yoga// easily. The Lord says:

> man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
> mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru

"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me." [[books:bg:18:65|(Bg. 18.65)]] If one practices devotional service by always keeping Kṛṣṇa within the core of his heart (//man-manāḥ//), he immediately becomes a first-class //yogī.// Furthermore, keeping Kṛṣṇa within the mind is not a difficult task for the devotee. For an ordinary man in the bodily concept of life, the practice of //yoga// may be helpful, but one who immediately takes to devotional service can immediately become a perfect //yogī// without difficulty.
