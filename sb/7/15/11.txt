===== Purport =====

The word //dharmavit,// meaning "one who knows the actual purpose of religion," is very significant. As explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]], //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious is the topmost stage in understanding of religious principles. One who reaches this stage performs the //arcanā// process in devotional service. Anyone, whether a //gṛhastha// or a //sannyāsī,// can keep small Deities of the Lord suitably packed or, if possible, installed, and thus worship the Deities of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Sītā-Rāma, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, Lord Jagannātha or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu by offering food prepared in ghee and then offering the sanctified //prasāda// to the forefathers, demigods and other living entities as a matter of routine daily work. All the centers of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have Deity worship programs very nicely going on in which food is offered to the Deity and distributed to the first-class //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas and even to the people in general. This performance of sacrifice brings complete satisfaction. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement engage daily in such transcendental activities. Thus in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there is no question at all of killing animals.
