===== Translation =====

**A pretentious religious system manufactured by one who willfully neglects the prescribed duties of his order of life is called ābhāsa [a dim reflection or false similarity]. But if one performs the prescribed duties for his particular āśrama or varṇa, why are they not sufficient to mitigate all material distresses?**

===== Purport =====

It is indicated here that everyone should strictly follow the principles of //varṇa// and //āśrama// as given in the //śāstra.// In the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// (3.8.9) it is said:

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

One should focus upon the destination for progress, which is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is the aim and end of all //varṇas// and //āśramas.// However, if Viṣṇu is not worshiped, the followers of the //varṇāśrama// institution manufacture some concocted God. Thus it has now become fashionable for any rascal or fool to be elected God, and there are many missionaries who have concocted their own gods, giving up their relationship with the real God. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly said that one who worships the demigods has lost his intelligence. Nonetheless we find that even an illiterate person who has lost all intelligence is elected God, and although he has a temple, it has meat-eating //sannyāsīs,// and many polluted activities go on there. This type of religious system, which misguides its poor followers, is strictly forbidden. Such pretentious religions should be stopped altogether.

The original system is that a //brāhmaṇa// should actually become a //brāhmaṇa;// he should not only take birth in a //brāhmaṇa// family, but must also be qualified. Also, even if one is not born in a //brāhmaṇa// family but has brahminical qualifications, he must be considered a //brāhmaṇa.// By strictly following this system, one can be happy without extra endeavor. //Sva-bhāva-vihito dharmaḥ kasya neṣṭaḥ praśāntaye.// The real aim of life is to mitigate distress, and one can do this very easily by following the principles of //śāstra.//
