===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(Bg. 9.32)]]:

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim

"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth---women, //vaiśyas// [merchants], as well as //śūdras// [workers]---can approach the supreme destination." It doesn't matter whether a person is born as a //śūdra,// a woman or a //vaiśya;// if he associates with devotees repeatedly or always (//sādhu-saṅgena//), he can be elevated to the highest perfection. Nārada Muni is explaining this in relation to his own life. The //saṅkīrtana// movement is important, for regardless of whether one is a //śūdra, vaiśya, mleccha, yavana// or whatever, if one associates with a pure devotee, follows his instructions and serves the pure devotee, his life is successful. This is //bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]].// Bhakti// consists of serving Kṛṣṇa and His devotees very favorably. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.1.11]. If one has no desire other than to serve Kṛṣṇa and His devotee, then his life is successful. This is explained by Nārada Muni through this practical example from his own life.
