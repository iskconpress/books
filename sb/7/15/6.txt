===== Purport =====

As mentioned above, it is recommended that everyone distribute //prasāda,// considering every living being a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Even in feeding the poor, one should distribute //prasāda.// In Kali-yuga there is a scarcity of food almost every year, and thus philanthropists spend lavishly to feed the poor. For this they invent the term //daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.// This is prohibited. One should distribute sumptuous //prasāda,// considering everyone a part of the Supreme Lord, but one should not juggle words to make a poor man Nārāyaṇa. Everyone is related to the Supreme Lord, but one should not mistakenly think that because one is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has become the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa. Such a Māyāvāda philosophy is extremely dangerous, especially for a devotee. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore strictly forbidden us to associate with Māyāvādī philosophers. //Māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa:// if one associates with the Māyāvāda philosophy, his devotional life is doomed.
