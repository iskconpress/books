===== Purport =====

In human life there are four principles to be fulfilled-//dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa// (religion, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation). First one should be religious, observing various rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for maintenance of his family and the satisfaction of his senses. The most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sexual intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Although sexual intercourse is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men require some sense gratification because of material propensities. One should be satisfied with married life and not expend energy for extra sense gratification or sex life.

As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be entrusted mainly to the //vaiśyas// and //gṛhasthas.// Human society should be divided into //varṇas// and //āśramas-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// Economic development is necessary for //gṛhasthas. Brāhmaṇa gṛhasthas// should be satisfied with a life of //adhyayana, adhyāpana, yajana// and //yājana//---being learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, and also teaching others how to worship Lord Viṣṇu, or even the demigods. A //brāhmaṇa// should do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a person whom he teaches how to be a human being. As for the //kṣatriyas,// they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land should be distributed to the //vaiśyas// for agricultural activities, cow protection and trade. //Śūdras// must work; sometimes they should engage in occupational duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brass-smiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce food grains.

These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn their livelihood, and in this way human society should be simple. At the present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological advancement, which is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as //ugra-karma//---extremely severe endeavor. This //ugra-karma// is the cause of agitation within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories, as well as nightclubs and other establishments for sense enjoyment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these activities, of course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with the use of the word //api,// that even though one is a householder, one should not engage himself in severe hardships. One's means of livelihood should be extremely simple. As for those who are not //gṛhasthas//---the //brahmacārīs, vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs//---they don't have to do anything but strive for advancement in spiritual life. This means that three fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and simply be engaged in the advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Only one fourth of the population should be //gṛhastha,// and that should be according to laws of restricted sense gratification. The //gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas, brahmacārīs// and //sannyāsīs// should endeavor together with their total energy to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This type of civilization is called //daiva-varṇāśrama.// One of the objectives of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to establish this //daiva-varṇāśrama,// but not to encourage so-called //varṇāśrama// without scientifically organized endeavor by human society.
