===== Purport =====

The //Vedas// recommend many ritualistic ceremonies to be performed with one's wife, on the birthdays of one's children, or during funeral ceremonies, and there are also personal reformatory methods like initiation. These must be observed according to time and circumstances and the directions of the //śāstra. Bhagavad-gītā// strongly recommends, //jñātvā śāstra-vidhānoktam:// everything must be performed as indicated in the //śāstras.// For Kali-yuga, the //śāstras// enjoin that //saṅkīrtana-yajña// be performed always: //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ//  [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. All the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the //śāstras// must be preceded and followed by //saṅkīrtana.// This is the recommendation of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī.
