===== Purport =====

Whenever we perform some religious act in terms of //dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa,// we must perform it according to the time, place and person (//kāla, deśa, pātra//). Nārada Muni has already described the //deśa// (place) and //kāla// (time). The //kāla// has been described in verses twenty through twenty-four, beginning with the words //ayane viṣuve kuryād vyatīpāte dina-kṣaye.// And the places for giving charity or performing ritualistic ceremonies have been described in verses thirty through thirty-three, beginning with //sarāṁsi puṣkarādīni kṣetrāṇy arhāśritāny uta.// Now, to whom everything must be given is decided in this verse. //Harir evaika urvīśa yan-mayaṁ vai carācaram.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the root of everything, and therefore He is the best //pātra,// or person, to whom everything must be given. In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]] it is said:

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati

If one wants to enjoy real peace and prosperity, he should give everything to Kṛṣṇa, who is the real enjoyer, real friend and real proprietor. It is therefore said:

> yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena
> tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ
> prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ
> tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā
> [[books:sb:4:31:14|(SB 4.31.14)]]

By worshiping or satisfying Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, one can satisfy everyone, just as one can water the branches, leaves and flowers of a tree simply by watering its root or as one satisfies all the senses of the body by giving food to the stomach. Therefore, a devotee simply offers everything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead to receive the best results of charity, religious performances, sense gratification and even liberation (//dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]] [[books:cc:adi:1:90|[Cc. Ādi 1.90]]]).
