===== Purport =====

In the previous chapters the great sage Nārada has explained how a //brahmacārī,// a //vānaprastha// and a //sannyāsī// should act. He first explained the dealings of a //brahmacārī, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsī// because these three //āśramas,// or statuses of life, are extremely important for fulfillment of the goal of life. One should note that in the //brahmacārī-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama// and //sannyāsa-āśrama// there is no scope for sex life, whereas sex is allowed in //gṛhastha// life under regulations. Nārada Muni, therefore, first described //brahmacarya, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa// because he wanted to stress that sex is not at all necessary, although one who absolutely requires it is allowed to enter //gṛhastha// life, or household life, which is also regulated by the //śāstras// and //guru.// Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja could understand all this. Therefore, as a //gṛhastha,// he presented himself as //gṛha-mūḍha-dhīḥ,// one who is completely ignorant of the goal of life. A person who remains a householder in family life is certainly ignorant of life's goal; he is not very much advanced in intelligence. As soon as possible, one should give up his so-called comfortable life at home and prepare to undergo austerity, or //tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. According to the instructions given by Ṛṣabhadeva to His sons, we should not create a so-called comfortable situation, but must prepare to undergo austerity. This is how a human being should actually live to fulfill life's ultimate goal.
