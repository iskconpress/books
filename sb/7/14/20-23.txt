{{description>One should perform the śrāddha ceremony on the Makara-saṅkrānti [the day when the sun begins to move north] or on the Karkaṭa-saṅkrānti [the day when the sun begins to move south]. One should also perform this ceremony on the Meṣa-saṅkrānti day and the Tulā-saṅkrānti day, in the yoga named Vyatīpāta, on that day in which three lunar tithis are conjoined, during an eclipse of either the moon or the sun, on the twelfth lunar day, and in the Śravaṇa-nakṣatra. One should perform this ceremony on the Akṣaya-tṛtīyā day, on the ninth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Kārtika, on the four aṣṭakās in the winter season and cool season, on the seventh lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Māgha, during the conjunction of Maghā-nakṣatra and the full-moon day, and on the days when the moon is completely full, or not quite completely full, when these days are conjoined with the nakṣatras from which the names of certain months are derived. One should also perform the śrāddha ceremony on the twelfth lunar day when it is in conjunction with any of the nakṣatras named Anurādhā, Śravaṇa, Uttara-phalgunī, Uttarāṣāḍhā or Uttara-bhādrapadā. Again, one should perform this ceremony when the eleventh lunar day is in conjunction with either Uttara-phalgunī, Uttarāṣāḍhā or Uttara-bhādrapadā. Finally, one should perform this ceremony on days conjoined with one's own birth star [janma-nakṣatra] or with Śravaṇa-nakṣatra.}}

===== Purport =====

The word //ayana// means "path" or "going." The six months when the sun moves toward the north are called //uttarāyaṇa,// or the northern path, and the six months when it moves south are called //dakṣiṇāyana,// or the southern path. These are mentioned in //Bhagavad-gītā// (8.24-25). The first day when the sun begins to move north and enter the zodiacal sign of Capricorn is called Makara-saṅkrānti, and the first day when the sun begins to move south and enter the sign of Cancer is called Karkaṭa-saṅkrānti. On these two days of the year, one should perform the //śrāddha// ceremony.

Viṣuva, or Viṣuva-saṅkrānti, means Meṣa-saṅkrānti, or the day on which the sun enters the sign Aries. Tulā-saṅkrānti is the day on which the sun enters the sign Libra. Both of these days occur only once within a year. The word //yoga// refers to a certain relationship between the sun and moon as they move in the sky. There are twenty-seven different degrees of //yoga,// of which the seventeenth is called Vyatīpāta. On the day when this occurs, one should perform the //śrāddha// ceremony. A //tithi,// or lunar day, consists of the distance between the longitude of the sun and that of the moon. Sometimes a //tithi// is less than twenty-four hours. When it starts after sunrise on a certain day and ends before the sunrise of the following day, the previous //tithi// and the following //tithi// both "touch" the twenty-four-hour day between the sunrises. This is called //tryaha-sparśa,// or a day touched by some portion of three //tithis.//

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has given quotations from many //śāstras// stating that the //śrāddha// ceremony of oblations to the forefathers should not be performed on Ekādaśī //tithi.// When the //tithi// of the death anniversary falls on the Ekādaśī day, the //śrāddha// ceremony should be held not on Ekādaśī but on the next day, or //dvādaśī.// In the //Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa// it is said:

> ye kurvanti mahīpāla
> śrāddhaṁ caikādaśi-dine
> trayas te narakaṁ yānti
> dātā bhoktā ca prerakaḥ

If one performs the //śrāddha// ceremony of oblations to the forefathers on the Ekādaśī //tithi,// then the performer, the forefathers for whom the //śrāddha// is observed, and the //purohita,// or the family priest who encourages the ceremony, all go to hell.
