**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the enjoyer of sacrificial offerings. Yet although His Lordship eats the oblations offered in the fire, my dear King, He is still more satisfied when nice food made of grains and ghee is offered to Him through the mouths of qualified brāhmaṇas.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]], //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:// all fruitive activities should be performed for sacrifice, which should be directed toward pleasing Kṛṣṇa. As stated elsewhere in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:29|(Bg. 5.29)]], //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram:// He is the Supreme Lord and enjoyer of everything. However, although sacrifice may be offered to please Kṛṣṇa, He is more pleased when grains and ghee, instead of being offered in the fire, are prepared as //prasāda// and distributed, first to the //brāhmaṇas// and then to others. This system pleases Kṛṣṇa more than anything else. Furthermore, at the present time there is very little chance to offer sacrifices by pouring oblations of food grains and ghee into the fire. Especially in India, there is practically no ghee; for everything that should be done with ghee, people use a certain type of oil preparation. Oil, however, is never recommended for offering in a sacrificial fire. In Kali-yuga, the available quantity of food grains and ghee is gradually diminishing, and people are embarrassed that they cannot produce sufficient ghee and food grains. Under the circumstances, the //śāstras// enjoin, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:// [SB 11.5.32] in this age, those who are intellectual offer //yajña,// or perform sacrifices, through the //saṅkīrtana// movement. Everyone should join the //saṅkīrtana// movement, offering to the fire of this movement the oblations of his knowledge and riches. In our //saṅkīrtana// movement, or Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, we offer sumptuous //prasāda// to the Deity and later distribute the same //prasāda// to the //brāhmaṇas,// the Vaiṣṇavas and then to the people in general. Kṛṣṇa's //prasāda// is offered to the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas, and the //prasāda// of the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas is offered to the general populace. This kind of sacrifice---chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and distribution of //prasāda//---is the most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of Yajña, or Viṣṇu.
