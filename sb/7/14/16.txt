===== Purport =====

If a //gṛhastha,// or householder, is sufficiently educated in Vedic knowledge and has become sufficiently rich to offer worship to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must perform //yajñas// as directed by the authorized scriptures. //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]] clearly says, //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:// everyone may be engaged in his occupational duties, but the result of these duties should be offered for sacrifice to satisfy the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to possess transcendental knowledge as well as the money with which to perform sacrifices, one must do it according to the directions given in the //śāstras.// It is said in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.3.52):

> kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
> tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
> dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
> kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt

The entire Vedic civilization aims at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was possible in Satya-yuga by meditation upon the Supreme Lord within the core of one's heart and in Tretā-yuga by the performance of costly //yajñas.// The same goal could be achieved in Dvāpara-yuga by worship of the Lord in the temple, and in this age of Kali one can achieve the same goal by performing //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// Therefore one who has education and wealth must use them to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by helping the //saṅkīrtana// movement that has already begun---the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. All educated and wealthy persons must join this movement, since money and education are meant for service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If money and education are not engaged in the service of the Lord, these valuable assets must be engaged in the service of //māyā.// The education of so-called scientists, philosophers and poets is now engaged in the service of //māyā,// and the wealth of the rich is also engaged in //māyā's// service. The service of //māyā,// however, creates a chaotic condition in the world. Therefore the wealthy man and the educated man should sacrifice their knowledge and opulence by dedicating them for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and joining this //saṅkīrtana// movement (//yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]).
