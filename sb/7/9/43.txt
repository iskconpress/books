===== Purport =====

Throughout the entire world, everyone is making big, big plans to adjust the miseries of the material world, and this is true at present, in the past and in the future. Nonetheless, although they make elaborate political, social and cultural plans, they have all been described herein as //vimūḍha//---fools. The material world has been described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]---temporary and miserable---but these fools are trying to turn the material world into //sukhālayam,// a place of happiness, not knowing how everything acts by the arrangement of material nature, which works in her own way.

"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." [[books:bg:3:27|(Bg. 3.27)]]

There is a plan for material nature, personally known as Durgā, to punish the demons. Although the //asuras,// the godless demons, struggle for existence, they are directly attacked by the goddess Durgā, who is well equipped with ten hands with different types of weapons to punish them. She is carried by her lion carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance. Everyone struggles very hard to fight through the modes of passion and ignorance and conquer material nature, but at the end everyone is vanquished by nature's laws.

There is a river known as Vaitaraṇī between the material and spiritual worlds, and one must cross this river to reach the other side, or the spiritual world. This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:14|(Bg. 7.14)]], //daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā:// "This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome." The same word //duratyaya,// meaning "very difficult," is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans, they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as //vimūḍha//---first-class fools. As for Prahlāda Mahārāja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the material world, he was full of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, trying to serve the Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is struggling for existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahlāda Mahārāja was happy and unhappy simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being Kṛṣṇa conscious, yet he felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material world.
