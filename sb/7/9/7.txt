===== Translation =====

**Prahlāda Mahārāja fixed his mind and sight upon Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva with full attention in complete trance. With a fixed mind, he began to offer prayers in love with a faltering voice.**

===== Purport =====

The word //susamāhitaḥ// means "very attentive" or "fully fixed." The ability to fix the mind in this way is a result of //yoga-siddhi,// mystic perfection. As it is stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (12.13.1), //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ.// One attains yogic perfection when he is freed from all material diversions and his mind is fixed upon the lotus feet of the Lord. This is called //samādhi// or trance. Prahlāda Mahārāja attained that stage beyond the senses. Because he was engaged in service, he felt transcendentally situated, and naturally his mind and attention became saturated in transcendence. In that condition, he began to offer his prayers as follows.
