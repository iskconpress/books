===== Purport =====

The //Vedas// enjoin: //nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo na medhayā na bahunā śrutena.// One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by studying the //Vedas// and offering prayers. Only by the grace of the Supreme Lord can one understand Him. The process of understanding the Lord, therefore, is //bhakti.// Without //bhakti,// simply following the Vedic injunctions to understand the Absolute Truth will not be helpful at all. The process of //bhakti// is understood by the //paramahaṁsa,// one who has accepted the essence of everything. The results of //bhakti// are reserved for such a //paramahaṁsa,// and this stage cannot be obtained by any Vedic process other than devotional service. Other processes, such as //jñāna// and //yoga,// can be successful only when mixed with //bhakti.// When we speak of //jñāna-yoga, karma-yoga// and //dhyāna-yoga// the word //yoga// indicates //bhakti. Bhakti-yoga,// or //buddhi-yoga,// executed with intelligence and full knowledge, is the only successful method for going back home, back to Godhead. If one wants to be liberated from the pangs of material existence, he should take to devotional service for quick attainment of this goal.
