===== Translation =====

**Prahlāda Mahārāja continued: One may possess wealth, an aristocratic family, beauty, austerity, education, sensory expertise, luster, influence, physical strength, diligence, intelligence and mystic yogic power, but I think that even by all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one can satisfy the Lord simply by devotional service. Gajendra did this, and thus the Lord was satisfied with him.**

===== Purport =====

No kind of material qualification is the means for satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// only by devotional service can the Lord be known (//bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]). Unless the Lord is pleased by the service of a devotee, the Lord does not reveal Himself (//nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]). This is the verdict of all //śāstras.// Neither by speculation nor by material qualifications can one understand or approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
