===== Purport =====

The words //dhīrāḥ sarva-bhāvena// do not mean "in whichever way you like." //Bhāva// is the preliminary condition of love of Godhead.

> athāsaktis tato bhāvas
> tataḥ premābhyudañcati
> sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ
> prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ
> (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.4.16)

The //bhāva// stage is the final division before one reaches love of Godhead. The word //sarva-bhāva// means that one can love the Supreme Personality of Godhead in different transcendental modes of mellows, beginning with //dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya// and //mādhurya.// In the //śānta// stage, one is on the border of loving service to the Lord. Pure love of Godhead begins from //dāsya// and develops to //sakhya, vātsalya// and then //mādhurya.// Still, in any of these five mellows one can render loving service to the Supreme Lord. Since our main business is to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can render service from any of the above-mentioned platforms of love.
