{{description>O Supreme Lord, You are actually the air, the earth, fire, sky and water. You are the objects of sense perception, the life airs, the five senses, the mind, consciousness and false ego. Indeed, You are everything, subtle and gross. The material elements and anything expressed, either by the words or by the mind, are nothing but You.}}

===== Translation =====

**O Supreme Lord, You are actually the air, the earth, fire, sky and water. You are the objects of sense perception, the life airs, the five senses, the mind, consciousness and false ego. Indeed, You are everything, subtle and gross. The material elements and anything expressed, either by the words or by the mind, are nothing but You.**

===== Purport =====

This is the all-pervasive conception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which explains how He spreads everywhere and anywhere. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:// everything is Brahman---the Supreme Brahman, Kṛṣṇa. Nothing exists without Him. As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:4|(Bg. 9.4)]]:

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ

"I exist everywhere, and everything exists in Me, yet I am not visible everywhere." The Lord can be visible only through devotional service. //Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ:// the Supreme Lord stays only where His devotees chant His glories.
