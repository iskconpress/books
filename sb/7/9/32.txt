{{description>O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, after the annihilation the creative energy is kept in You, who appear to sleep with half-closed eyes. Actually, however, You do not sleep like an ordinary human being, for You are always in a transcendental stage, beyond the creation of the material world, and You always feel transcendental bliss. As Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, You thus remain in Your transcendental status, not touching material objects. Although You appear to sleep, this sleeping is distinct from sleeping in ignorance.}}

===== Translation =====

**O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, after the annihilation the creative energy is kept in You, who appear to sleep with half-closed eyes. Actually, however, You do not sleep like an ordinary human being, for You are always in a transcendental stage, beyond the creation of the material world, and You always feel transcendental bliss. As Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, You thus remain in Your transcendental status, not touching material objects. Although You appear to sleep, this sleeping is distinct from sleeping in ignorance.**

===== Purport =====

As explained very clearly in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.47):

> yaḥ kāraṇārṇava-jale bhajati sma yoga-
> nidrām ananta-jagad-aṇḍa-sa-roma-kūpaḥ
> ādhāra-śaktim avalambya parāṁ sva-mūrtiṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

"I worship the primeval Lord Govinda, who lies down in the Causal Ocean in His plenary portion as Mahā-Viṣṇu, with all the universes generating from the pores of hair on His transcendental body, and who accepts the mystic slumber of eternity." The //ādi-puruṣa,// the original Supreme Personality of Godhead---Kṛṣṇa, Govinda---expands Himself as Mahā-Viṣṇu. After the annihilation of this cosmic manifestation, He keeps Himself in transcendental bliss. The word //yoga-nidrām// is used in reference to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should understand that this //nidrā,// or sleep, is not like our //nidrā// in the mode of ignorance. The Lord is always situated in transcendence. He is //sac-cid-ānanda// [Bs. 5.1]---eternally in bliss---and thus He is not disturbed by sleep like ordinary human beings. It should be understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in transcendental bliss in all stages. Śrīla Madhvācārya concisely states that the Lord is //turya-sthitaḥ,// always situated in transcendence. In transcendence there is no such thing as //jāgaraṇa-nidrā-susupti//---wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep.

The practice of //yoga// is similar to the //yoga-nidrā// of Mahā-Viṣṇu. //Yogīs// are advised to keep their eyes half closed, but this state is not at all one of sleep, although imitation //yogīs,// especially in the modern age, manifest their so-called //yoga// by sleeping. In the //śāstra, yoga// is described as //dhyānāvasthita,// a state of full meditation, but this is meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā:// the mind should always be situated at the lotus feet of the Lord. //Yoga// practice does not mean sleeping. The mind should always be actively fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord. Then one's practice of //yoga// will be successful.
