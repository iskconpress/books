===== Translation =====

**When Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva saw the small boy Prahlāda Mahārāja prostrated at the soles of His lotus feet, He became most ecstatic in affection toward His devotee. Raising Prahlāda, the Lord placed His lotus hand upon the boy's head because His hand is always ready to create fearlessness in all of His devotees.**

===== Purport =====

The necessities of the material world are four-//āhāra, nidrā, bhaya// and //maithuna// (eating, sleeping, defending and mating). In this material world, everyone is in fearful consciousness (//sadā samudvigna-dhiyām//), and the only means to make everyone fearless is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared, all the devotees became fearless. The devotee's hope of becoming fearless is to chant the holy name of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. //Yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ:// wherever we go, we must always think of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. Thus there will be no fear for the devotee of the Lord.
