===== Translation =====

**The great saint Nārada said: Thus Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva was pacified by the devotee Prahlāda Mahārāja with prayers offered from the transcendental platform. The Lord gave up His anger, and being very kind to Prahlāda, who was offering prostrated obeisances, He spoke as follows.**

===== Purport =====

The word //nirguṇa// is important. The Māyāvādī philosophers accept the Absolute Truth as //nirguṇa// or //nirākāra.// The word //nirguṇa// refers to one who possesses no material qualities. The Lord, being full of spiritual qualities, gave up all His anger and spoke to Prahlāda.
