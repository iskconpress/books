===== Purport =====

The //śāstras// enjoin, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet:// [MU 1.2.12] when one is perplexed by the difficult problems of life, to solve them one must approach a //guru// like Nārada or his representative in the disciplic succession. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira therefore requested Nārada to explain the cause for such a wonderful event.
