===== Purport =====

Śiśupāla and Dantavakra were formerly Jaya and Vijaya, the doorkeepers of Vaikuṇṭha. Merging into the body of Kṛṣṇa was not their final destination. For some time they remained merged, and later they received the liberations of //sārūpya// and //sālokya,// living on the same planet as the Lord in the same bodily form. The //śāstras// give evidence that if one blasphemes the Supreme Lord, his punishment is to remain in hellish life for many millions of years more than one suffers by killing many //brāhmaṇas.// Śiśupāla, however, instead of entering hellish life, immediately and very easily received //sāyujya-mukti.// That such a privilege had been offered to Śiśupāla was not merely a story. Everyone saw it happen; there was no scarcity of evidence. How did it happen? Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was very much surprised.
