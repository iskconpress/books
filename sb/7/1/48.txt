===== Translation =====

**Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira inquired: O my lord, Nārada Muni, why was there such enmity between Hiraṇyakaśipu and his beloved son Prahlāda Mahārāja? How did Prahlāda Mahārāja become such a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa? Kindly explain this to me.**

===== Purport =====

All the devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are called //acyutātmā// because they follow in the footsteps of Prahlāda Mahārāja. Acyuta refers to the infallible Lord Viṣṇu, whose heart is always infallible. Because the devotees are attached to the infallible, they are called //acyutātmā.//

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, First Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Supreme Lord Is Equal to Everyone."
