===== Translation =====

**Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira inquired: What kind of great curse could affect even liberated viṣṇu-bhaktas, and what sort of person could curse even the Lord's associates? For unflinching devotees of the Lord to fall again to this material world is impossible. I cannot believe this.**

===== Purport =====

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:16|(Bg. 8.16)]] the Lord clearly states, //mām upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate:// one who is purified of material contamination and returns home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material world. Elsewhere in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]] Kṛṣṇa says:

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti so 'rjuna

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, therefore, was surprised that a pure devotee could return to this material world. This is certainly a very important question.
