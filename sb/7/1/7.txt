===== Purport =====

The original position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one of equality. There is no question of His being influenced by //sattva-guṇa, rujo-guṇa// or //tamo-guṇa,// for these material qualities cannot touch the Supreme Lord. The Lord is therefore called the supreme //īśvara. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ:// [Bs. 5.1] He is the supreme controller. He controls the material qualities (//daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]). //Mayādhyakṣena prakṛtiḥ sūyate: [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]// material nature (//prakṛti//) works under His order. How, then, can He be under the qualities of //prakṛti//? Kṛṣṇa is never influenced by the material qualities. Therefore there is no question of partiality in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
