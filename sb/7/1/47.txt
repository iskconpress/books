===== Translation =====

**These two associates of Lord Viṣṇu---Jaya and Vijaya---maintained a feeling of enmity for a very long time. Because of always thinking of Kṛṣṇa in this way, they regained the shelter of the Lord, having returned home, back to Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

Whatever their position, certainly Jaya and Vijaya always thought of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore at the end of the //mausala-līlā,// these two associates of the Lord returned to Kṛṣṇa. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's body and Nārāyaṇa's body. Therefore although they visibly entered the body of Kṛṣṇa, they actually reentered Vaikuṇṭhaloka as the doorkeepers of Lord Viṣṇu. Through Lord Kṛṣṇa's body, they returned to Vaikuṇṭha, although they seemed to have attained //sāyujya-mukti// in Kṛṣṇa's body.
