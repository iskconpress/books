===== Translation =====

**Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira inquired: It is very wonderful that the demon Śiśupāla merged into the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead even though extremely envious. This sāyujya-mukti is impossible to attain even for great transcendentalists. How then did the enemy of the Lord attain it?**

===== Purport =====

There are two classes of transcendentalists---the //jñānīs// and the //bhaktas.// The //bhaktas// do not aspire to merge into the existence of the Lord, but the //jñānīs// do. Śiśupāla, however, was neither a //jñānī// nor a //bhakta,// yet simply by envy of the Lord he attained an exalted position by merging into the Lord's body. Certainly this was astonishing, and therefore Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira inquired about the cause for the Lord's mysterious mercy to Śiśupāla.
