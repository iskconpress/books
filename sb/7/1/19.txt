===== Purport =====

Kṛṣṇa is described by Arjuna in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:12-13|(Bg. 10.12)]] as follows: //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.// "You are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode and purifier." Herein this is confirmed. //Viṣṇuṁ yad brahma param avyayam.// The Supreme Viṣṇu is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the cause of Viṣṇu, not vice versa. Similarly, Brahman is not the cause of Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa is the cause of Brahman. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the Parabrahman (//yad brahma param avyayam//).
