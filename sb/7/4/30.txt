"In one who has unflinching devotional faith in Kṛṣṇa, all the good qualities of Kṛṣṇa and the demigods are consistently manifest." [[books:sb:5:18:12|(SB 5.18.12)]] Prahlāda Mahārāja is praised herein for having all good qualities because of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, a pure devotee, who has no motives, has all good qualities, material and spiritual. If one is spiritually advanced, being a staunch, liberal devotee of the Lord, all good qualities are manifest in his body. On the other hand, //harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ:// if one is not a devotee, even if he has some materially good qualities, they have no value. That is the verdict of the //Vedas.//
