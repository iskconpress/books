===== Purport =====

The less intelligent men who are always busy worshiping the demigods should note that when the demigods are harassed by the demons, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief. Since the demigods resort to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why should the worshipers of the demigods not approach the Supreme Lord for whatever benefits they desire? //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:2:3:10|(2.3.10)]] says:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param

"Whether one desires everything or nothing, or whether he desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service." Whether one is a //karmī, jñānī// or //yogī,// if one wants a particular benediction fulfilled, even if it be material, one should approach the Supreme Lord and pray to Him, for then it will be fulfilled. There is no need to approach any demigod separately for the fulfillment of any desire.
