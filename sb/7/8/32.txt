{{description>The hair on Nṛsiṁhadeva's head shook the clouds and scattered them here and there, His glaring eyes stole the effulgence of the luminaries in the sky, and His breathing agitated the seas and oceans. Because of His roaring, all the elephants in the world began to cry in fear.}}

===== Purport =====

As the Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:41|(Bg. 10.41)]]:

> yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ
> śrīmad ūrjitam eva vā
> tat tad evāvagaccha tvaṁ
> mama tejo-'ṁśa-sambhavam

"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor." The illumination of the planets and stars in the sky is but a partial manifestation of the Lord's effulgence. There are many wonderful qualities of different living entities, but whatever extraordinary things exist are but part of the Lord's //tejas,// His illumination or brilliance. The deep waves of the seas and oceans and the many other wonders within the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead all become insignificant when the Lord, in His special feature, incarnates within this material world. Everything is insignificant in comparison to His personal, all-defeating transcendental qualities.
