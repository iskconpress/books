===== Translation =====

**O my friends, O sons of demons, everyone, including you (the Yakṣas and Rākṣasas), the unintelligent women, śūdras and cowherd men, the birds, the lower animals and the sinful living entities, can revive his original, eternal spiritual life and exist forever simply by accepting the principles of bhakti-yoga.**

===== Purport =====

The devotees are referred to as //acyuta-gotra,// or the dynasty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is called Acyuta, as indicated in //Bhagavad-gītā// (//senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta [[books:bg:1:21-22|[Bg. 1.21]]]//). The Lord is infallible in the material world because He is the supreme spiritual person. Similarly, the //jīvas,// who are part and parcel of the Lord, can also become infallible. Although Prahlāda's mother was in the conditional state and was the wife of a demon, even Yakṣas, Rākṣasas, women, //śūdras// and even birds and other lower living entities can be elevated to the //acyuta-gotra,// the family of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the highest perfection. As Kṛṣṇa never falls, when we revive our spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we never fall again to material existence. One should understand the position of the supreme Acyuta, Kṛṣṇa, who says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:9|(Bg. 4.9)]]:

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti so 'rjuna

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One should understand Acyuta, the supreme infallible, and how we are related with Him, and one should take to the service of the Lord. This is the perfection of life. Śrīla Madhvācārya says, //acyutatāṁ cyuti-varjanam.// The word //acyutatām// refers to one who never falls to this material world but always remains in the Vaikuṇṭha world, fully engaged in the service of the Lord.
