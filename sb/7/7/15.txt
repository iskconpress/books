===== Purport =====

Here it is said, //dharmasya tattvaṁ jñānaṁ ca. .. nirmalam.// The word //nirmalam// refers to spotless //dharma,// spotless religion---or, in other words, //bhāgavata-dharma.// Ordinary ritualistic activities constitute contaminated religion, by which one benefits by developing material wealth and prosperity, but uncontaminated, pure religion consists of understanding one's relationship with God and acting accordingly, thus fulfilling the highest mission of life and returning home, back to Godhead. Prahlāda Mahārāja advised that one elevate oneself to the standard of //bhāgavata-dharma// from the very beginning of life (//kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]). The Lord Himself also speaks of pure, uncontaminated religion when He says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]] One must understand one's relationship with God and then act accordingly. This is //bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma// means //bhakti-yoga.//

> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam

"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." [[books:sb:1:2:7|(SB 1.2.7)]] To be situated on the platform of pure religion, one should perform //bhakti-yoga// in relationship with Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva.
