**The real problem of life is the repetition of birth and death, which is like a wheel rolling repeatedly up and down. This wheel, however, completely stops when one is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, by the transcendental bliss realized from constant engagement in devotional service, one is completely liberated from material existence. All learned men know this. Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the asuras, immediately begin meditating upon and worshiping the Supersoul within everyone's heart.**

===== Purport =====

Generally it is understood that by merging into the existence of Brahman, the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth, one becomes completely happy.  The words //brahma-nirvāṇa// refer to connecting with the Absolute Truth, who is realized in three features: //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]].  One feels //brahma-sukha,// spiritual happiness, by merging into the impersonal Brahman because the //brahmajyoti// is the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi// [Bs. 5.40].  //Yasya prabhā,// the impersonal Brahman, consists of the rays of Kṛṣṇa's transcendental body.  Therefore whatever transcendental bliss one feels from merging in Brahman is due to contact with Kṛṣṇa.  Contact with Kṛṣṇa is perfect //brahma-sukha.//  When the mind is in touch with the impersonal Brahman one becomes satisfied, but one must advance further to render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for one's remaining merged in the Brahman effulgence is not always assured.  As it is said, //āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ:// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]] one may merge in the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth, but there is a chance that one may fall because of not being acquainted with Adhokṣaja, or Vāsudeva.  Of course, such //brahma-sukha// undoubtedly eliminates material happiness, but when one advances through impersonal Brahman and localized Paramātmā to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in relationship with Him as a servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover, one's happiness becomes all-pervading.  Then one automatically feels transcendental bliss, just as one becomes happy seeing the shining of the moon.  One acquires natural happiness upon seeing the moon, but when one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's transcendental happiness increases hundreds and thousands of times.  As soon as one is very intimately connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one surely becomes free from all material contamination.  //Yā nirvṛtis tanu-bhṛtām.//  This cessation of all material happiness is called //nirvṛti// or //nirvāṇa.//  Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says in //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// (1.1.38):

> brahmānando bhaved eṣa
> cet parārdha-guṇī-kṛtaḥ
> naiti bhakti-sukhāmbhodheḥ
> paramāṇu-tulām api

"If //brahmānanda,// the bliss of merging in the Brahman effulgence, were multiplied one hundred trillion times, it would still not equal even an atomic fragment of the ocean of transcendental bliss felt in devotional service."

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām

"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto the Lord." [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]] If one advances further from the //brahma-nirvāṇa// platform, one enters the stage of devotional service (//mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām//). The word //adhokṣajālambham// refers to keeping the mind always engaged in the Absolute Truth, who is beyond the mind and material speculation. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]].// This is the result of Deity worship. By constantly engaging in the service of the Lord and thinking of His lotus feet, one is automatically freed from all material contamination. Thus the word //brahma-nirvāṇa-sukham// indicates that when one is in touch with the Absolute Truth, material sense gratification is completely nullified.
