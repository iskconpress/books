**Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the demons, your duty is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which can burn the seed of fruitive activities artificially created by the modes of material nature and stop the flow of the intelligence in wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. In other words, when one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his ignorance is immediately dissipated.**

===== Purport =====

This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:14:26|(Bg. 14.26)]]:

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate

"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." By the practice of //bhakti-yoga,// one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. The root of ignorance is material consciousness, which must be killed by spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The word //bīja-nirharaṇam// refers to burning the root cause of material life to ashes. In the Medinī dictionary, //yoga// is explained by its result: //yoge 'pūrvārtha-samprāptau saṅgati-dhyāna-yuktiṣu.// When one is put into an awkward position because of ignorance, the process by which one can be freed from this entanglement is called //yoga.// This is also called liberation. //Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. //Mukti// means giving up one's position in ignorance or illusion, by which one thinks in a way contrary to his constitutional position. Returning to one's constitutional position is called //mukti,// and the process by which one does this is called //yoga.// Thus //yoga// is above //karma, jñāna// and //sāṅkhya.// Indeed, //yoga// is the ultimate goal of life. Kṛṣṇa therefore advised Arjuna to become a //yogī// (//tasmād yogī bhavārjuna//). Lord Kṛṣṇa further advised in //Bhagavad-gītā// that the first-class //yogī// is he who has come to the platform of devotional service.

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ

"Of all //yogīs,// he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in //yoga// and is the highest of all." [[books:bg:6:47|(Bg. 6.47)]] Thus one who always thinks of Kṛṣṇa within the core of his heart is the best //yogī.// By practicing this best of all //yoga// systems, one is liberated from the material condition.
