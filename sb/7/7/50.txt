===== Purport =====

Prahlāda Mahārāja, by his living example, requested his friends to engage in devotional service. Whether in demigod society, //asura// society, human society or Gandharva society, every living entity should take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda and thus become perfect in good fortune.
