===== Purport =====

//Hariḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// This statement is sometimes misunderstood by unscrupulous persons who wrongly conclude that because Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is situated in every living entity, every living entity is therefore Hari. Such foolish persons do not distinguish between the //ātmā// and the Paramātmā, who are situated in every body. The //ātma// is the living entity, and the Paramātmā is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual living entity, however, is different from the Paramātmā, the Supreme Lord. Therefore //hariḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu// means that Hari is situated as Paramātmā, not as //ātmā,// although //ātmā// is a part of Paramātmā. Offering respect to every living entity means offering respect to the Paramātmā situated in every living entity. One should not misunderstand every living entity to be the Paramātmā. Sometimes unscrupulous persons designate a living entity as //daridra-nārāyaṇa, svāmī-nārāyaṇa,// this Nārāyaṇa or that Nārāyaṇa. One should clearly understand that although Nārāyaṇa is situated in the core of the heart of every living entity, the living entity never becomes Nārāyaṇa.
