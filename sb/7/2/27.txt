===== Purport =====

The words //itihāsaṁ purātanam// mean "an old history." The //Purāṇas// are not chronologically recorded, but the incidents mentioned in the //Purāṇas// are actual histories of bygone ages. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the //Mahā-Purāṇa,// the essence of all the //Purāṇas.// The Māyāvādī scholars do not accept the //Purāṇas,// but Śrīla Madhvācārya and all other authorities accept them as the authoritative histories of the world.
