===== Purport =====

The followers of demoniac principles, as described here, are thoroughly envious of the general populace. In the present day, scientific advancement exemplifies such envy. The discovery of nuclear energy has been disastrous to people in general because demons all over the world are manufacturing nuclear weapons. The word //kadana-priyāḥ// is very significant in this regard. The demoniac persons who want to kill the Vedic culture are extremely envious of the feeble citizens, and they act in such a way that ultimately their discoveries will be inauspicious for everyone (//jagato 'hitāḥ//). The Sixteenth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// fully explains how the demons engage in sinful activities for the destruction of the populace.
