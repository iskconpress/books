===== Translation =====

**Thus disturbed again and again by the unnatural occurrences caused by the followers of Hiraṇyakaśipu, all the people had to cease the activities of Vedic culture. Not receiving the results of yajña, the demigods also became disturbed. They left their residential quarters in the heavenly planets and, unobserved by the demons, began wandering on the planet earth to see the disasters.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the performance of //yajña// brings reciprocal good fortune for both the human beings and the demigods. When the performances of //yajña// were stopped by the disturbances of the demons, the demigods were naturally bereft of the results of //yajña// and hampered in executing their respective duties. Therefore they came down to the planet earth to see how people had become disturbed and to consider what to do.
