===== Purport =====

According to the //mīmāṁsā// philosophers, everything is eternal, //nitya,// and according to the Sāṅkhya philosophers everything is //mithyā,// or //anitya//---impermanent. Nonetheless, without real knowledge of //ātma//---, the soul, such philosophers must be bewildered and must continue to lament as //śūdras.// Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī therefore said to Parīkṣit Mahārāja:

> śrotavyādīni rājendra
> nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ
> apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ
> gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām

"Those who are materially engrossed, being blind to knowledge of the ultimate truth, have many subjects for hearing in human society, O Emperor." [[books:sb:2:1:2|(SB 2.1.2)]] For ordinary persons engaged in material activities there are many, many subject matters to understand because such persons do not understand self-realization. One must therefore be educated in self-realization so that under any circumstances in life he will remain steady in his vows.
