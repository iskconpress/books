===== Purport =====

People in general are all engaged in senseless work. They are systematically unmindful of the real beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the //arcanā// regulations. The //arcanā// regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the //Nārada-pañcarātra// and are strictly followed by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Viṣṇu, who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the //Bhāgavatam// and in //Bhagavad-gītā// such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in realization of Viṣṇu. The //Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:7:5:30|(7.5.30-32)]] says:

> matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā
> mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām
> adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ
> punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām
>
> na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ
> durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ
> andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās
> te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ
>
> naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ
> spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ
> mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-'bhiṣekaṁ
> niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat

"Persons who are determined to totally rot in false, material happiness cannot become Kṛṣṇa-minded either by instructions from teachers, by self-realization or by parliamentary discussions. They are dragged by the unbridled senses into the darkest region of ignorance, and thus they madly engage in what is called 'chewing the chewed.'

"Because of their foolish activities, they are unaware that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve Viṣṇu, the Lord of the cosmic manifestation, and so their struggle for existence is in the wrong direction of material civilization, which is under the external energy. They are led by similar foolish persons, just as one blind man is led by another blind man and both fall in the ditch.

"Such foolish men cannot be attracted towards the activities of the Supreme Powerful, who is actually the neutralizing measure for their foolish activities, unless and until they have the good sense to be guided by the great souls who are completely freed from material attachment."

In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord asks everyone to give up all other occupational duties and absolutely engage in //arcanā// activities, or in pleasing the Lord. But almost no one is attracted to such //arcanā// activity. Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme Lord. The systems of //jñāna// and //yoga// are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no auspicious activity except //arcanā// of the Lord. //Jñāna// and //yoga// are sometimes accepted within the purview of //arcanā// when the ultimate aim is Viṣṇu, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence without any actual benefit.
