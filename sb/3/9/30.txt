===== Purport =====

The mercy the Lord bestows upon a particular person engaged in executing the responsible work entrusted unto him is beyond imagination. But His mercy is received due to our penance and perseverance in executing devotional service. Brahmā was entrusted with the work of creating the planetary systems. The Lord instructed him that when he meditated he would very easily know where and how the planetary systems must be arranged. The directions were to come from within, and there was no necessity for anxiety in that task. Such instructions of //buddhi-yoga// are directly imparted by the Lord from within, as confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]].
