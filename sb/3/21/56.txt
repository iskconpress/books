===== Purport =====

When a guest comes to a friend's house, it is understood that there is some special purpose. Kardama Muni could understand that such a great king as Svāyambhuva, although traveling to inspect the condition of his kingdom, must have had some special purpose to come to his hermitage. Thus he prepared himself to fulfill the King's desire. Formerly it was customary that the sages used to go to the kings and the kings used to visit the sages in their hermitages; each was glad to fulfill the other's purpose. This reciprocal relationship is called //bhakti-kārya.// There is a nice verse describing the relationship of mutual beneficial interest between the //brāhmaṇa// and the //kṣatriya// (//kṣatraṁ dvijatvam//). //Kṣatram// means "the royal order," and //dvijatvam// means "the brahminical order." The two were meant for mutual interest. The royal order would give protection to the //brāhmaṇas// for the cultivation of spiritual advancement in society, and the //brāhmaṇas// would give their valuable instruction to the royal order on how the state and the citizens can gradually be elevated in spiritual perfection.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Conversation Between Manu and Kardama."
