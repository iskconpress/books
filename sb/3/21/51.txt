===== Purport =====

Since the sage Kardama was a //brāhmaṇa// and Svāyambhuva was a //kṣatriya,// the sage was not supposed to offer obeisances to the King because socially his position was greater than the King's. But he offered his obeisances to Svāyambhuva Manu because as Manu, king and emperor, he was the representative of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always worshipable, regardless of whether one is a //brāhmaṇa,// a //kṣatriya// or a //śūdra.// As the representative of the Supreme Lord, the King deserved respectful obeisances from everyone.
