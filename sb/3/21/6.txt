===== Purport =====

It is understood herein that Kardama Muni meditated in //yoga// for ten thousand years before attaining perfection. Similarly, we have information that Vālmīki Muni also practiced //yoga// meditation for sixty thousand years before attaining perfection. Therefore, //yoga// practice can be successfully performed by persons who have a very long duration of life, such as one hundred thousand years; in that way it is possible to have perfection in //yoga.// Otherwise, there is no possibility of attaining the real perfection. Following the regulations, controlling the senses and practicing the different sitting postures are merely the preliminary practices. We do not know how people can be captivated by the bogus //yoga// system in which it is stated that simply by meditating fifteen minutes daily one can attain the perfection of becoming one with God. This age (Kali-yuga) is the age of bluffing and quarrel. Actually there is no possibility of attaining //yoga// perfection by such paltry proposals. The Vedic literature, for emphasis, clearly states three times that in this age of Kali-//kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva//---there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative than //harer nāma// [Adi 17.21], chanting the holy name of the Lord.
