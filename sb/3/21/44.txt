**Its shores abounded with deer, boars, porcupines, gavayas, elephants, baboons, lions, monkeys, mongooses and musk deer.**

===== Purport =====

Musk deer are not found in every forest, but only in places like Bindu-sarovara. They are always intoxicated by the aroma of musk secreted from their navels. //Gavayas,// the species of cow mentioned herein, bear a bunch of hair at the end of their tails. This bunch of hair is used in temple worship to fan the Deities. //Gavayas// are sometimes called //camarīs,// and they are considered very sacred. In India there are still gypsies or forest mercantile people who flourish by trading //kastūrī,// or musk, and the bunches of hair from the //camarīs.// These are always in great demand for the higher classes of Hindu population, and such business still goes on in large cities and villages in India.
