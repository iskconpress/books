===== Purport =====

Because the scientific division of four //varṇas// and four //āśramas// is now being extinguished, the entire world is being governed by unwanted men who have no training in religion, politics or social order, and it is in a very deplorable condition. In the institution of four //varṇas// and four //āśramas// there are regular training principles for the different classes of men. Just as, in the modern age, there is a necessity for engineers, medical practitioners and electricians, and they are properly trained in different scientific institutions, similarly, in former times, the higher social orders, namely the intelligent class (the //brāhmaṇas//), the ruling class (the //kṣatriyas//) and the mercantile class (the //vaiśyas//), were properly trained. //Bhagavad-gītā// describes the duties of the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// When there is no such training, one simply claims that because he is born in a //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya// family, he is therefore a //brāhmaṇa// or a //kṣatriya,// even though he performs the duties of a //śūdra.// Such undue claims to being a higher-caste man make the system of scientific social orders into a caste system, completely degrading the original system. Thus society is now in chaos, and there is neither peace nor prosperity. It is clearly stated herein that unless there is the vigilance of a strong king, impious, unqualified men will claim a certain status in society, and that will make the social order perish.
