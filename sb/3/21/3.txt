===== Purport =====

Here we are speaking of Svāyambhuva Manu, but in //Bhagavad-gītā// we hear about Vaivasvata Manu. The present age belongs to the Vaivasvata Manu. Svāyambhuva Manu was previously ruling, and his history begins from the Varāha age, or the millennium when the Lord appeared as the boar. There are fourteen Manus in one day of the life of Brahmā, and in the life of each Manu there are particular incidents. The Vaivasvata Manu of //Bhagavad-gītā// is different from Svāyambhuva Manu.
