===== Purport =====

The realization of the personal form of the Lord is the highest perfectional stage of //yoga.// In the Sixth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā,// where //yoga// practice is described, this realization of the personal form of the Lord is called the perfection of //yoga.// After practicing the sitting postures and other regulative principles of the system, one finally reaches the stage of //samādhi//---absorption in the Supreme. In the //samādhi// stage one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His partial form as Paramātmā, or as He is. //Samādhi// is described in authoritative //yoga// scriptures, such as the //Patañjali-sūtras,// to be a transcendental pleasure. The //yoga// system described in the books of Patañjali is authoritative, and the modern so-called //yogīs// who have manufactured their own ways, not consulting the authorities, are simply ludicrous. The Patañjali //yoga// system is called //aṣṭāṅga-yoga.// Sometimes impersonalists pollute the Patañjali //yoga// system because they are monists. Patañjali describes that the soul is transcendentally pleased when he meets the Supersoul and sees Him. If the existence of the Supersoul and the individual is admitted, then the impersonalist theory of monism is nullified. Therefore some impersonalists and void philosophers twist the Patañjali system in their own way and pollute the whole //yoga// process.

According to Patañjali, when one becomes free from all material desires he attains his real, transcendental situation, and realization of that stage is called spiritual power. In material activities a person engages in the modes of material nature. The aspirations of such people are (1) to be religious, (2) to be economically enriched, (3) to be able to gratify the senses and, at last, (4) to become one with the Supreme. According to the monists, when a //yogī// becomes one with the Supreme and loses his individual existence, he attains the highest stage, called //kaivalya.// But actually, the stage of realization of the Personality of Godhead is //kaivalya.// The oneness of understanding that the Supreme Lord is fully spiritual and that in full spiritual realization one can understand what He is---the Supreme Personality of Godhead---is called //kaivalya,// or, in the language of Patañjali, realization of spiritual power. His proposal is that when one is freed from material desires and fixed in spiritual realization of the self and the Superself, that is called //cit-śakti.// In full spiritual realization there is a perception of spiritual happiness, and that happiness is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as the supreme happiness, which is beyond the material senses. Trance is described to be of two kinds, //samprajñāta// and //asamprajñāta,// or mental speculation and self-realization. In //samādhi// or //asamprajñāta// one can realize, by his spiritual senses, the spiritual form of the Lord. That is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization.

According to Patañjali, when one is fixed in constant realization of the supreme form of the Lord, one has attained the perfectional stage, as attained by Kardama Muni. Unless one attains this stage of perfection---beyond the perfection of the preliminaries of the //yoga// system---there is no ultimate realization. There are eight perfections in the //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system. One who has attained them can become lighter than the lightest and greater than the greatest, and he can achieve whatever he likes. But even achieving such material success in //yoga// is not the perfection or the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is described here: Kardama Muni saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form. Devotional service begins with the relationship of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, or Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's devotees, and when one attains it there is no question of falling down. If, through the //yoga// system, one wants to attain the stage of seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, but is attracted instead to attainment of some material power, then he is detoured from proceeding further. Material enjoyment, as encouraged by bogus //yogīs,// has nothing to do with the transcendental realization of spiritual happiness. Real devotees of //bhakti-yoga// accept only the material necessities of life absolutely needed to maintain the body and soul together; they refrain completely from all exaggerated material sense gratification. They are prepared to undergo all kinds of tribulation, provided they can make progress in the realization of the Personality of Godhead.
