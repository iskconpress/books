===== Purport =====

It is definitely recommended herein that one concentrate his mind upon the form of Viṣṇu. There are twelve different forms of Viṣṇu, which are described in //Teachings of Lord Caitanya.// One cannot concentrate his mind on anything void or impersonal; the mind should be fixed on the personal form of the Lord, whose attitude is cheerful, as described in this verse. //Bhagavad-gītā// states that meditation on the impersonal or void features is very troublesome to the meditator. Those who are attached to the impersonal or void features of meditation have to undergo a difficult process because we are not accustomed to concentrating our minds upon anything impersonal. Actually such concentration is not even possible. //Bhagavad-gītā// also confirms that one should concentrate his mind on the Personality of Godhead.

The color of the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is described here as //nīlotpala-dala,// meaning that it is like that of a lotus flower with petals tinted blue and white. People always ask why Kṛṣṇa is blue. The color of the Lord has not been imagined by an artist. It is described in authoritative scripture. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// also, the color of Kṛṣṇa's body is compared to that of a bluish cloud. The color of the Lord is not poetical imagination. There are authoritative descriptions in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā// and many of the //purāṇas// of the Lord's body, His weapons and all other paraphernalia. The Lord's appearance is described here as //padma-garbhāruṇekṣaṇam.// His eyes resemble the inside of a lotus flower, and in His four hands He holds the four symbols: conchshell, discus, mace and lotus.
