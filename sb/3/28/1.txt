===== Purport =====

The //yoga// process explained by Lord Kapiladeva in this chapter is authorized and standard, and therefore these instructions should be followed very carefully. To begin, the Lord says that by //yoga// practice one can make progress towards understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the previous chapter it has been clearly stated that the desired result of //yoga// is not to achieve some wonderful mystic power. One should not be at all attracted by such mystic power, but should attain progressive realization on the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā,// which states in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter that the greatest //yogī// is he who constantly thinks of Kṛṣṇa within himself, or he who is Kṛṣṇa conscious.

It is stated here that by following the system of //yoga// one can become joyful. Lord Kapila, the Personality of Godhead, who is the highest authority on //yoga,// here explains the //yoga// system known as //aṣṭāṅga-yoga,// which comprises eight different practices, namely //yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna// and //samādhi.// By all these stages of practice one must realize Lord Viṣṇu, who is the target of all //yoga.// There are so-called //yoga// practices in which one concentrates the mind on voidness or on the impersonal, but this is not approved by the authorized //yoga// system as explained by Kapiladeva. Even Patañjali explains that the target of all //yoga// is Viṣṇu. //Aṣṭāṅga-yoga// is therefore part of Vaiṣṇava practice because its ultimate goal is realization of Viṣṇu. The achievement of success in //yoga// is not acquisition of mystic power, which is condemned in the previous chapter, but, rather, freedom from all material designations and situation in one's constitutional position. That is the ultimate achievement in //yoga// practice.
