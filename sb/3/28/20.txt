===== Purport =====

The word //muni// is very significant. //Muni// means one who is very expert in mental speculation or in thinking, feeling and willing. He is not mentioned here as a devotee or //yogī.// Those who try to meditate on the form of the Lord are called //munis,// or less intelligent, whereas those who render actual service to the Lord are called //bhakti-yogīs.// The thought process described below is for the education of the //muni.// In order to convince the //yogī// that the Absolute Truth, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never impersonal at any time, the following verses prescribe observing the Lord in His personal form, limb after limb. To think of the Lord as a whole may sometimes be impersonal; therefore, it is recommended here that one first think of His lotus feet, then His ankles, then the thighs, then the waist, then the chest, then the neck, then the face and so on. One should begin from the lotus feet and gradually rise to the upper limbs of the transcendental body of the Lord.
