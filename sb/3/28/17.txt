===== Translation =====

**The Lord is eternally very beautiful, and He is worshipable by all the inhabitants of every planet. He is ever youthful and always eager to bestow His blessing upon His devotees.**

===== Purport =====

The word //sarva-loka-namaskṛtam// means that He is worshipable by everyone on every planet. There are innumerable planets in the material world and innumerable planets in the spiritual world as well. On each planet there are innumerable inhabitants who worship the Lord, for the Lord is worshipable by all but the impersonalists. The Supreme Lord is very beautiful. The word //śaśvat// is significant. It is not that He appears beautiful to the devotees but is ultimately impersonal. //Śaśvat// means "ever existing." That beauty is not temporary. It is ever existing---He is always youthful. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.33) it is also stated: //advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// The original person is one without a second, yet He never appears old; He always appears as ever fresh as a blooming youth.

The Lord's facial expression always indicates that He is ready to show favor and benediction to the devotees; for the nondevotees, however, He is silent. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// although He acts equally to everyone because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and because all living entities are His sons, He is especially inclined to those engaged in devotional service. The same fact is confirmed here: He is always anxious to show favor to the devotees. Just as the devotees are always eager to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is also very eager to bestow benediction upon the pure devotees.
