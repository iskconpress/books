===== Translation =====

**After controlling one's mind and sitting postures, one should spread a seat in a secluded and sanctified place, sit there in an easy posture, keeping the body erect, and practice breath control.**

===== Purport =====

Sitting in an easy posture is called //svasti samāsīnaḥ.// It is recommended in the //yoga// scripture that one should put the soles of the feet between the two thighs and ankles and sit straight; that posture will help one to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This very process is also recommended in //Bhagavad-gītā,// Sixth Chapter. It is further suggested that one sit in a secluded, sanctified spot. The seat should consist of deerskin and //kuśa// grass, topped with cotton.
