===== Purport =====

This process of purifying the mind is also recommended by Lord Caitanya; He says that one should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. He says further, //paraṁ vijayate:// "All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa //saṅkīrtana!//" All glories are given to the chanting of the holy names of Kṛṣṇa because as soon as one begins this process of chanting, the mind becomes purified. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]] by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa one is cleansed of the dirt that accumulates in the mind. One can purify the mind either by the breathing process or by the chanting process, just as one can purify gold by putting it in a fire and fanning it with a bellows.
