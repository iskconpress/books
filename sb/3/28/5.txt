===== Purport =====

The yogic practices in general and //haṭha-yoga// in particular are not ends in themselves; they are means to the end of attaining steadiness. First one must be able to sit properly, and then the mind and attention will become steady enough for practicing //yoga.// Gradually, one must control the circulation of vital air, and with such control he will be able to withdraw the senses from sense objects. In the previous verse it is stated that one must observe celibacy. The most important aspect of sense control is controlling sex life. That is called //brahmacarya.// By practicing the different sitting postures and controlling the vital air, one can control and restrain the senses from unrestricted sense enjoyment.
