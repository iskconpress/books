===== Purport =====

The word //rasāyām// is sometimes interpreted to mean Rasātala, the lowest planetary system, but that is not applicable in this connection, according to Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. The earth is seven times superior to the other planetary systems, namely Tala, Atala, Talātala, Vitala, Rasātala, Pātāla, etc. Therefore the earth cannot be situated in the Rasātala planetary system. It is described in the //Viṣṇu-dharma://

> pātāla-mūleśvara-bhoga-saṁhatau
> vinyasya pādau pṛthivīṁ ca bibhrataḥ
> yasyopamāno na babhūva so 'cyuto
> mamāstu māṅgalya-vivṛddhaye hariḥ

Therefore the Lord found the earth on the bottom of the Garbhodaka Ocean, where the planets rest during the devastation at the end of Brahmā's day.
