===== Purport =====

The //veda-vādīs// say that there is nothing more than the //Vedas// and the performances of sacrifice mentioned in the //Vedas.// They have recently made a rule in their group to formally observe daily sacrifice; they simply ignite a small fire and offer something whimsically, but they do not strictly follow the sacrificial rules and regulations mentioned in the //Vedas.// It is understood that by regulation there are different plates of sacrifice required, such as //srak, sruvā, barhis, cātur-hotra, iḍā, camasa, prāśitra, graha// and //agni-hotra.// One cannot achieve the results of sacrifice unless one observes the strict regulations. In this age there is practically no facility for performing sacrifices in strict discipline. Therefore, in this age of Kali there is a stricture regarding such sacrifices: it is explicitly directed that one should perform //saṅkīrtana-yajña// and nothing more. The incarnation of the Supreme Lord is Yajñeśvara, and unless one has respect for the incarnation of the Lord, he cannot perfectly perform sacrifice. In other words, taking shelter of the Lord and rendering service unto Him is the factual performance of all sacrifices, as explained herein. Different plates of sacrifice correspond to the different parts of the body of the Lord's incarnation. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Eleventh Canto, it is explicitly directed that one should perform //saṅkīrtana-yajña// to please the Lord's incarnation as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This should be rigidly followed in order to achieve the result of //yajña// performance.
