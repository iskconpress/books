===== Translation =====

**In this manner the Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, the maintainer of all living entities, raised the earth from within the water, and having placed it afloat on the water, He returned to His own abode.**

===== Purport =====

The Personality of Godhead Lord Viṣṇu descends by His will to the material planets in His innumerable incarnations for particular purposes, and again He goes back to His own abode. When He descends He is called an //avatāra// because //avatāra// means "one who descends." Neither the Lord Himself nor His specific devotees who come to this earth are ordinary living entities like us.
