===== Translation =====

**Playing like an elephant, He entered into the water after roaring again in reply to the Vedic prayers by the great devotees. The Lord is the object of the Vedic prayers, and thus He understood that the devotees' prayers were meant for Him.**

===== Purport =====

The form of the Lord in any shape is always transcendental and full of knowledge and mercy. The Lord is the destroyer of all material contamination because His form is personified Vedic knowledge. All the //Vedas// worship the transcendental form of the Lord. In the Vedic //mantras// the devotees request the Lord to remove the glaring effulgence because it covers His real face. That is the version of the //Īśopaniṣad.// The Lord has no material form, but His form is always understood in terms of the //Vedas.// The //Vedas// are said to be the breath of the Lord, and that breath was inhaled by Brahmā, the original student of the //Vedas.// The breathing from the nostril of Brahmā caused the appearance of Lord Boar, and therefore the boar incarnation of the Lord is the personified //Vedas.// The glorification of the incarnation by the sages on the higher planets consisted of factual Vedic hymns. Whenever there is glorification of the Lord, it is to be understood that Vedic //mantras// are being rightly vibrated. The Lord was therefore pleased when such Vedic //mantras// were chanted, and to encourage His pure devotees, He roared once more and entered the water to rescue the submerged earth.
