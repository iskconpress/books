===== Purport =====

A person in the renounced order of life, a //sannyāsī,// is also called a //sādhu// because he renounces everything---his home, his comfort, his friends, his relatives, and his duties to friends and to family. He renounces everything for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A //sannyāsī// is generally in the renounced order of life, but his renunciation will be successful only when his energy is employed in the service of the Lord with great austerity. It is said here, therefore, //bhaktiṁ kurvanti ye dṛḍhām.// A person who seriously engages in the service of the Lord and is in the renounced order of life is a //sādhu.// A //sādhu// is one who has given up all responsibility to society, family, and worldly humanitarianism, simply for the service of the Lord. As soon as he takes his birth in the world, a person has so many responsibilities and obligations---to the public, to the demigods, to the great sages, to the general living beings, to his parents, to the family forefathers and to many others. When he gives up all such obligations for the sake of the service of the Supreme Lord, he is not punished for such renunciation of obligation. But if for sense gratification a person renounces all such obligations, he is punished by the law of nature.
