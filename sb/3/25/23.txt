===== Purport =====

There are multifarious miseries in material existence---those pertaining to the body and the mind, those imposed by other living entities and those imposed by natural disturbances. But a //sādhu// is not disturbed by such miserable conditions because his mind is always filled with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus he does not like to talk about anything but the activities of the Lord. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa did not speak of anything but the pastimes of the Lord. //Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|(SB 9.4.18)]]. He engaged his words only in glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Sādhus// are always interested in hearing about the activities of the Lord or His devotees. Since they are filled with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are forgetful of the material miseries. Ordinary conditioned souls, being forgetful of the activities of the Lord, are always full of anxieties and material tribulations. On the other hand, since the devotees always engage in the topics of the Lord, they are forgetful of the miseries of material existence.
