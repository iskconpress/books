===== Purport =====

Kapila Muni is accepted as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Here the word //ādyaḥ// means "the origin of all living entities," and //puṁsām īśvaraḥ// means "the Lord (//īśvara//) of the living entities" (//īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]). Kapila Muni is the direct expansion of Kṛṣṇa, who is the sun of spiritual knowledge. As the sun dissipates the darkness of the universe, so when the light of the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes down, it at once dissipates the darkness of //māyā.// We have our eyes, but without the light of the sun our eyes are of no value. Similarly, without the light of the Supreme Lord, or without the divine grace of the spiritual master, one cannot see things as they are.
