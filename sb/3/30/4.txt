===== Translation =====

**The living entity, in whatever species of life he appears, finds a particular type of satisfaction in that species, and he is never averse to being situated in such a condition.**

===== Purport =====

The satisfaction of the living entity in a particular type of body, even if it is most abominable, is called illusion. A man in a higher position may feel dissatisfaction with the standard of life of a lower-grade man, but the lower-grade man is satisfied in that position because of the spell of //māyā,// the external energy. //Māyā// has two phases of activities. One is called //prakṣepātmikā,// and the other is called //āvaraṇātmikā. Āvaraṇātmikā// means "covering," and //prakṣepātmikā// means "pulling down." In any condition of life, the materialistic person or animal will be satisfied because his knowledge is covered by the influence of //māyā.// In the lower grade or lower species of life, the development of consciousness is so poor that one cannot understand whether he is happy or distressed. This is called //āvaraṇātmikā.// Even a hog, who lives by eating stool, finds himself happy, although a person in a higher mode of life sees that the hog is eating stool. How abominable that life is!
