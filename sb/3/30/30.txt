===== Translation =====

**After leaving this body, the man who maintained himself and his family members by sinful activities suffers a hellish life, and his relatives suffer also.**

===== Purport =====

The mistake of modern civilization is that man does not believe in the next life. But whether he believes or not, the next life is there, and one has to suffer if one does not lead a responsible life in terms of the injunctions of authoritative scriptures like the //Vedas// and //purāṇas.// Species lower than human beings are not responsible for their actions because they are made to act in a certain way, but in the developed life of human consciousness, if one is not responsible for his activities, then he is sure to get a hellish life, as described herein.
