===== Purport =====

Materialistic life is based on sex life. The existence of all the materialistic people, who are undergoing severe tribulation in the struggle for existence, is based on sex. Therefore, in the Vedic civilization sex life is allowed only in a restricted way; it is for the married couple and only for begetting children. But when sex life is indulged in for sense gratification illegally and illicitly, both the man and the woman await severe punishment in this world or after death. In this world also they are punished by virulent diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea, and in the next life, as we see in this passage of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// they are put into different kinds of hellish conditions to suffer. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// First Chapter, illicit sex life is also very much condemned, and it is said that one who produces children by illicit sex life is sent to hell. It is confirmed here in the //Bhāgavatam// that such offenders are put into hellish conditions of life in Tāmisra, Andha-tāmisra and Raurava.
