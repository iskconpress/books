===== Purport =====

The entire universe is moving under the three modes of material nature. Those living entities who are in goodness are called the pious species---pious lands, pious trees, etc. It is similar with the planets also; many planets are considered pious, and others are considered impious. Saturn and Mars are considered impious. When the pious planets shine very brightly, it is an auspicious sign, but when the inauspicious planets shine very brightly, this is not a very good sign.
