**Varuṇa continued: On reaching Him you will be rid of your pride at once and will lie down on the field of battle, surrounded by dogs, for eternal sleep. It is in order to exterminate wicked fellows like you and to show His grace to the virtuous that He assumes His various incarnations like Varāha.**

===== Purport =====

//Asuras// do not know that their bodies consist of the five elements of material nature and that when they fall they become objects of pastimes for dogs and vultures. Varuṇa advised Hiraṇyākṣa to meet Viṣṇu in His boar incarnation so that his hankering for aggressive war would be satisfied and his powerful body would be vanquished.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Victory of Hiraṇyākṣa Over All the Directions of the Universe."
