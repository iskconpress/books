===== Translation =====

**After experiencing the inhabitable time of the three modes of material nature, known as two parārdhas, Lord Brahmā closes the material universe, which is covered by layers of earth, water, air, fire, ether, mind, ego, etc., and goes back to Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

The word //avyākṛtam// is very significant in this verse. The same meaning is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// in the word //sanātana.// This material world is //vyākṛta,// or subject to changes, and it finally dissolves. But after the dissolution of this material world, the manifestation of the spiritual world, the //sanātana-dhāma,// remains. That spiritual sky is called //avyākṛta,// that which does not change, and there the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. When, after ruling over the material universe under the influence of the time element, Lord Brahmā desires to dissolve it and enter into the kingdom of God, others then enter with him.
