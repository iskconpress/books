===== Translation =====

**The greatest common understanding for all yogīs is complete detachment from matter, which can be achieved by different kinds of yoga.**

===== Purport =====

There are three kinds of //yoga,// namely //bhakti-yoga, jñāna-yoga// and //aṣṭāṅga-yoga.// Devotees, //jñānīs// and //yogīs// all try to get out of the material entanglement. The //jñānīs// try to detach their sensual activities from material engagement. The //jñāna-yogī// thinks that matter is false and that Brahman is truth; he tries, therefore, by cultivation of knowledge, to detach the senses from material enjoyment. The //aṣṭāṅga-yogīs// also try to control the senses. The devotees, however, try to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore it appears that the activities of the //bhaktas,// devotees, are better than those of the //jñānīs// and //yogīs.// The mystic //yogīs// simply try to control the senses by practicing the eight divisions of //yoga-yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra,// etc.---and the //jñānīs// try by mental reasoning to understand that sense enjoyment is false. But the easiest and most direct process is to engage the senses in the service of the Lord.

The purpose of all //yoga// is to detach one's sense activities from this material world. The final aims, however, are different. //Jñānīs// want to become one with the Brahman effulgence, //yogīs// want to realize Paramātmā, and devotees want to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness and transcendental loving service to the Lord. That loving service is the perfect stage of sense control. The senses are actually active symptoms of life, and they cannot be stopped. They can be detached only if there is superior engagement. As it is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā, paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 9.59]]] the activities of the senses can be stopped if they are given superior engagements. The supreme engagement is engagement of the senses in the service of the Lord. That is the purpose of all //yoga.//
