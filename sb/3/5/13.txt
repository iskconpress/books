===== Purport =====

We must certainly know that on the absolute plane //kṛṣṇa-kathā// and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. The Lord is the Absolute Truth, and therefore His name, form, quality, etc., which are all understood to be //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// are nondifferent from Him. //Bhagavad-gītā,// being spoken by the Lord, is as good as the Lord Himself. When a sincere devotee reads //Bhagavad-gītā,// this is as good as seeing the Lord face to face in his personal presence, but this is not so for the mundane wrangler. All the potencies of the Lord are there when one reads //Bhagavad-gītā,// provided it is read in the way recommended in the //Gītā// by the Lord Himself. One cannot foolishly manufacture an interpretation of //Bhagavad-gītā// and still bring about transcendental benefit. Anyone who tries to squeeze some artificial meaning or interpretation from //Bhagavad-gītā// for an ulterior motive is not //śraddadhāna-puṁsaḥ// (one engaged anxiously in bona fide hearing of //kṛṣṇa-kathā//). Such a person cannot derive any benefit from reading //Bhagavad-gīta,// however great a scholar he may be in the estimation of a layman. The //śraddadhāna,// or faithful devotee, can actually derive all the benefits of //Bhagavad-gītā// because by the omnipotency of the Lord he achieves the transcendental bliss which vanquishes attachment and nullifies all concomitant material miseries. Only the devotee, by his factual experience, can understand the import of this verse spoken by Vidura. The pure devotee of the Lord enjoys life by constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord by hearing //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// For such a devotee there is no such thing as material existence, and the much advertised bliss of //brahmānanda// is like a fig for the devotee who is in the midst of the transcendental ocean of bliss.
