===== Purport =====

Some important things are mentioned here about //yoga.// The word //bahu janma-vipakvena// means "after many, many births of mature //yoga// practice." And another word, //samyag-yoga-samādhinā,// means "by complete practice of the //yoga// system." Complete practice of //yoga// means //bhakti-yoga;// unless one comes to the point of //bhakti-yoga,// or surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's //yoga// practice is not complete. This same point is corroborated in the //Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante:// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]] after many, many births, the //jñānī// who has matured in transcendental knowledge surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kardama Muni repeats the same statement. After many, many years and many, many births of complete practice of //yoga,// one can see the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord in a secluded place. It is not that after one practices some sitting postures he immediately becomes perfect. One has to perform //yoga// a long time---"many, many births"---to become mature, and a //yogī// has to practice in a secluded place. One cannot practice //yoga// in a city or in a public park and declare that he has become God simply by some exchange of dollars. This is all bogus propaganda. Those who are actually //yogīs// practice in a secluded place, and after many, many births they become successful, provided they surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the completion of //yoga.//
