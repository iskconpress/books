===== Purport =====

Whenever there is //bhakti,// there must be three things present---the devotee, the devotion and the Lord. Without these three---//bhakta, bhakti// and Bhagavān---there is no meaning to the word //bhakti.// Kardama Muni fixed his mind on the Supreme Brahman and realized Him through //bhakti,// or devotional service. This indicates that he fixed his mind on the personal feature of the Lord because //bhakti// cannot be executed unless one has realization of the personal feature of the Absolute Truth. //Guṇāvabhāse:// He is beyond the three modes of material nature, but it is due to Him that the three modes of material nature are manifested. In other words, although the material energy is an emanation of the Supreme Lord, He is not affected, as we are, by the modes of material nature. We are conditioned souls, but He is not affected, although the material nature has emanated from Him. He is the supreme living entity and is never affected by //māyā,// but we are subordinate, minute living entities, prone to be affected by the limitations of //māyā.// If he is in constant contact with the Supreme Lord by devotional service, the conditioned living entity also becomes freed from the infection of //māyā.// This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā: sa guṇān samatītyaitān// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. A person engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is at once liberated from the influence of the three modes of material nature. In other words, once the conditioned soul engages himself in devotional service, he also becomes liberated like the Lord.
