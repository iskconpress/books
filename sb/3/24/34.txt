===== Purport =====

Actually, //sannyāsa,// or renunciation of material household life, necessitates complete absorption in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and immersion in the self. One does not take //sannyāsa,// freedom from family responsibility in the renounced order of life, to make another family or to create an embarrassing transcendental fraud in the name of //sannyāsa.// The //sannyāsī's// business is not to become proprietor of so many things and amass money from the innocent public. A //sannyāsī// is proud that he is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa within himself. Of course, there are two kinds of devotees of the Lord. One is called //goṣṭhy-ānandī,// which means those who are preachers and have many followers for preaching the glories of the Lord and who live among those many, many followers just to organize missionary activities. Other devotees are //ātmānandī,// or self-satisfied, and do not take the risk of preaching work. They remain, therefore, alone with God. In this classification was Kardama Muni. He wanted to be free from all anxieties and remain alone within his heart with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Parivrāja// means "an itinerant mendicant." A mendicant //sannyāsī// should not live anywhere for more than three days. He must be always moving because his duty is to move from door to door and enlighten people about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
