===== Translation =====

**Not considering the negligence of ordinary householders like us, that very same Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in our homes just to support His devotees.**

===== Purport =====

Devotees are so affectionate toward the Personality of Godhead that although He does not appear before those who practice //yoga// in a secluded place even for many, many births, He agrees to appear in a householder's home where devotees engage in devotional service without material //yoga// practice. In other words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a householder, although a //yogī,// but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila Muni as his son.

Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of transcendental realization. The Lord says, therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuṇṭha nor in the heart of a //yogī,// but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as //bhakta-vatsala.// He is never described as //jñānī-vatsala// or //yogī-vatsala.// He is always described as //bhakta-vatsala// because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward other transcendentalists. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is confirmed that only a devotee can understand Him as He is. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti:// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]] "One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise." That understanding alone is real because although //jñānīs,// mental speculators, can realize only the effulgence, or the bodily luster, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and //yogīs// can realize only the partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a //bhakta// not only realizes Him as He is but also associates with the Personality of Godhead face to face.
