===== Translation =====

**Freed from all hatred and desire, Kardama Muni, being equal to everyone because of discharging uncontaminated devotional service, ultimately attained the path back to Godhead.**

===== Purport =====

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// only by devotional service can one understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and, after understanding Him perfectly in His transcendental position, enter into the kingdom of God. The process of entering into the kingdom of God is //tri-pāda-bhūti-gati,// or the path back home, back to Godhead, by which one can attain the ultimate goal of life. Kardama Muni, by his perfect devotional knowledge and service, achieved this ultimate goal, which is known as //bhāgavatī gatiḥ.//

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "The Renunciation of Kardama Muni."
