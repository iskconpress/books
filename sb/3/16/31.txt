**The Lord assured the two Vaikuṇṭha inhabitants, Jaya and Vijaya: By practicing the mystic yoga system in anger, you will be cleansed of the sin of disobeying the brāhmaṇas and within a very short time return to Me.**

===== Purport =====

The Supreme Personality of Godhead advised the two doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, that by dint of //bhakti-yoga// in anger they would be delivered from the curses of the //brāhmaṇas.// Śrīla Madhva Muni remarks in this connection that by practicing //bhakti-yoga// one can become free from all sinful reactions. Even a //brahma-śāpa,// or curse by a //brāhmaṇa,// which cannot be overcome by any other means, can be overcome by //bhakti-yoga.//

One can practice //bhakti-yoga// in many //rasas.// There are twelve //rasas,// five primary and seven secondary. The five primary //rasas// constitute direct //bhakti-yoga,// but although the seven secondary //rasas// are indirect, they are also counted within //bhakti-yoga// if they are used in the service of the Lord. In other words, //bhakti-yoga// is all-inclusive. If one somehow or other becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes engaged in //bhakti-yoga,// as described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// (10.29.15): //kāmaṁ krodhaṁ bhayam.// The //gopīs// were attracted to Kṛṣṇa by //bhakti-yoga// in a relationship of lusty desire (//kāma//). Similarly, Kaṁsa was attached to //bhakti-yoga// by dint of fear of his death. Thus //bhakti-yoga// is so powerful that even becoming an enemy of the Lord and always thinking of Him can deliver one very quickly. It is said, //viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daiva āsuras tad-vipanyayaḥ:// "Devotees of Lord Viṣṇu are called demigods, whereas nondevotees are called //asuras.//" ut //bhakti-yoga// is so powerful that both demigods and //asuras// can derive its benefits if they always think of the Personality of Godhead. The basic principle of //bhakti-yoga// is to think of the Supreme Lord always. The Lord says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:65|(Bg. 18.65)]], //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:// "Always think of Me." It doesn't matter which way one thinks; the very thought of the Personality of Godhead is the basic principle of //bhakti-yoga.//

In the material planets there are different grades of sinful activities, of which disrespecting a //brāhmaṇa// or a Vaiṣṇava is the most sinful. Here it is clearly stated that one can overcome even that grave sin simply by thinking of Viṣṇu, not even favorably but in anger. Thus even if those who are not devotees always think of Viṣṇu, they become free from all sinful activities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest form of thought. Lord Viṣṇu is thought of in this age by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. From the statements of the //Bhāgavatam// it appears that if one thinks of Kṛṣṇa, even as an enemy, that particular qualification---//thinking of Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa//---cleanses one of all sins.
