===== Purport =====

The statement in this verse //dharmasya paramo guhyaḥ// refers to the most confidential part of all religious principles. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā.// The conclusion of Lord Kṛṣṇa in His advice to Arjuna is: "Give up all other religious engagement and just surrender unto Me." This is the most confidential knowledge in executing religious principles. In the //Bhāgavatam// also it is stated that if one does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious after very rigidly executing one's specified religious duties, all his labor in following so-called religious principles is simply a waste of time. Here also the sages confirm the statement that the Supreme Lord, not the demigods, is the ultimate goal of all religious principles. There are many foolish propagandists who say that worship of the demigods is also a way to reach the supreme goal, but in the authorized statements of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Bhagavad-gītā// this is not accepted. //Bhagavad-gītā// says that one who worships a particular demigod can reach the demigod's planet, but one who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead can enter into Vaikuṇṭha. Some propagandists say that regardless of what one does he will ultimately reach the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, but this is not valid. The Lord is eternal, the Lord's servitor is eternal, and the Lord's abode is also eternal. They are all described here as //sanātana,// or eternal. The result of devotional service, therefore, is not temporary, as is the achievement of heavenly planets by worshiping the demigods. The sages wanted to stress that although the Lord, out of His causeless mercy, says that He worships the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas, actually the Lord is worshipable not only by the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas but also by the demigods.
