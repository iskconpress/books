===== Purport =====

In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is clearly stated that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes. There are undoubtedly many demigods, the chiefs of whom are Brahmā and Śiva. Lord Viṣṇu is the Lord of Brahmā and Śiva, not to speak of the //brāhmaṇas// in this material world. As mentioned in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the Supreme Lord is very favorable towards all activities performed according to brahminical culture, or the qualities of control of the senses and mind, cleanliness, forbearance, faith in scripture, and practical and theoretical knowledge. The Lord is the Supersoul of everyone. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that the Lord is the source of all emanations; thus He is also the source of Brahmā and Śiva.
