===== Translation =====

**I do not enjoy the oblations offered by the sacrificers in the sacrificial fire, which is one of My own mouths, with the same relish as I do the delicacies overflowing with ghee which are offered to the mouths of the brāhmaṇas who have dedicated to Me the results of their activities and who are ever satisfied with My prasāda.**

===== Purport =====

The devotee of the Lord, or the Vaiṣṇava, does not take anything without offering it to the Lord. Since a Vaiṣṇava dedicates all the results of his activities to the Lord, he does not taste anything eatable which is not first offered to Him. The Lord also relishes giving to the Vaiṣṇava's mouth all eatables offered to Him. It is clear from this verse that the Lord eats through the sacrificial fire and the //brāhmaṇa's// mouth. So many articles---grains, ghee, etc.---are offered in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. The Lord accepts sacrificial offerings from the //brāhmaṇas// and devotees, and elsewhere it is stated that whatever is given for the //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas to eat is also accepted by the Lord. But here it is said that He accepts offerings to the mouths of //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇavas with even greater relish. The best example of this is found in the life of Advaita Prabhu in his dealings with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Even though Haridāsa was born of a Muhammadan family, Advaita Prabhu offered him the first dish of //prasāda// after the performance of a sacred fire ceremony. Haridāsa Ṭhākura informed him that he was born of a Muhammadan family and asked why Advaita Prabhu was offering the first dish to a Muhammadan instead of an elevated //brāhmaṇa.// Out of his humbleness, Haridāsa condemned himself a Muhammadan, but Advaita Prabhu, being an experienced devotee, accepted him as a real //brāhmaṇa.// Advaita Prabhu asserted that by offering the first dish to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he was getting the result of feeding one hundred thousand //brāhmaṇas.// The conclusion is that if one can feed a //brāhmaṇa// or Vaiṣṇava, it is better than performing hundreds of thousands of sacrifices. In this age, therefore, it is recommended that //harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]---chanting the holy name of God---and pleasing the Vaiṣṇava are the only means to elevate oneself to spiritual life.
