===== Purport =====

In this verse the word //saṁsṛtīḥ// is very important. //Śreyaḥ-sṛti// means the prosperous path of advancement towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and //saṁsṛti// means the continued journey on the path of birth and death towards the darkest region of material existence. People who have no knowledge of this material world, God and their actual intimate relationship with Him are actually going to the darkest region of material existence in the name of progress in the material advancement of civilization. To enter the darkest region of material existence means to enter into a species of life other than the human species. Ignorant men do not know that after this life they are completely under the grip of material nature and will be offered a life which may not be very congenial. How a living entity gets different kinds of bodies will be explained in the next chapter. This continual change of bodies in birth and death is called //saṁsāra.// Devahūti requests her glorious son, Kapila Muni, to explain about this continued journey to impress upon the conditioned souls that they are undergoing a path of degradation by not understanding the path of //bhakti-yoga,// devotional service.
