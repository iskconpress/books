===== Purport =====

Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is clearly described in this passage. He is the supreme enjoyer, and all others are working as His servants. As stated in the //Caitanya caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:adi:5:14|(Ādi 5.14)]], //ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa:// the only Supreme Lord is Viṣṇu. //Āra saba bhṛtya:// all others are His servants. Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and other demigods are all servants. The same Viṣṇu enters everyone's heart as Paramātmā, and He causes the annihilation of every being through another being.
