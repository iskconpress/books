===== Translation =====

**Performing his prescribed duties, one should worship the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead until one realizes My presence in his own heart and in the hearts of other living entities as well.**

===== Purport =====

Worship of the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is prescribed herewith even for persons who are simply discharging their prescribed duties. There are prescribed duties for the different social classes of men---the //brāhmaṇas,// the //vaiśyas,// the //kṣatriyas// and the //śūdras//---and for the different //āśramas-brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// One should worship the Deity of the Lord until one appreciates the presence of the Lord in every living entity. In other words, one should not be satisfied simply by discharging his duties properly; he must realize his relationship and the relationship of all other living entities with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he does not understand this, then even though he discharges his prescribed duties properly, it is to be understood that he is simply laboring without profit.

The word //sva-karma-kṛt// in this verse is very significant. //Sva-karma-kṛt// is one who engages in discharging his prescribed duties. It is not that one who has become a devotee of the Lord or who engages in devotional service should give up his prescribed duties. No one should be lazy under the plea of devotional service. One has to execute devotional service according to his prescribed duties. //Sva-karma-kṛt// means that one should discharge the duties prescribed for him without neglect.
