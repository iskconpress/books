===== Purport =====

The Lord states in //Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate: [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]// "Nature is working under My direction." The foolish person thinks that nature is working automatically, but such an atheistic theory is not supported in the Vedic literature. Nature is working under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā,// and we also find here that the sun shines under the direction of the Lord, and the cloud pours forth showers of rain under the direction of the Lord. All natural phenomena are under superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu.
