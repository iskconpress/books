===== Translation =====

**The division of gross time is calculated as follows: two atoms make one double atom, and three double atoms make one hexatom. This hexatom is visible in the sunshine which enters through the holes of a window screen. One can clearly see that the hexatom goes up towards the sky.**

===== Purport =====

The atom is described as an invisible particle, but when six such atoms combine together, they are called a //trasareṇu,// and this is visible in the sunshine pouring through the holes of a window screen.
