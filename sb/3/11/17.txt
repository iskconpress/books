===== Purport =====

Those who have reached the highest perfectional stage of mystic power and can see everything in the past, present and future are called //tri-kāla-jñas.// Similarly, the devotees of the Lord can see everything clearly that is in the revealed scriptures. The devotees of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can very easily understand the science of Kṛṣṇa, as well as the situation of the material and spiritual creations, without difficulty. Devotees do not have to endeavor for any //yoga-siddhi,// or perfection in mystic powers. They are competent to understand everything by the grace of the Lord, who is sitting in everyone's heart.
