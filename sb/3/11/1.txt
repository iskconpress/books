===== Translation =====

**The material manifestation's ultimate particle, which is indivisible and not formed into a body, is called the atom. It exists always as an invisible identity, even after the dissolution of all forms. The material body is but a combination of such atoms, but it is misunderstood by the common man.**

===== Purport =====

The atomic description of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is almost the same as the modern science of atomism, and this is further described in the Paramāṇu-vāda of Kaṇāda. In modern science also, the atom is accepted as the ultimate indivisible particle of which the universe is composed. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the full text of all descriptions of knowledge, including the theory of atomism. The atom is the minute subtle form of eternal time.
