===== Translation =====

**The one hundred years of Brahmā's life are divided into two parts, the first half and the second half. The first half of the duration of Brahmā's life is already over, and the second half is now current.**

===== Purport =====

The duration of one hundred years in the life of Brahmā has already been discussed in many places in this work, and it is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:17|(Bg. 8.17)]] also. Fifty years of the life of Brahmā are already over, and fifty years are yet to be completed; then, for Brahmā also, death is inevitable.
