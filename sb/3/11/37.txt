===== Purport =====

The different millenniums known as the Brāhma, Pādma and Vārāha //kalpas// appear a little puzzling for the layman. There are some scholars who think these //kalpas// to be one and the same. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the Brāhma-kalpa in the beginning of the first half appears to be the Pādma-kalpa. We can, however, simply abide by the text and understand that the present millennium is in the second half of the duration of the life of Brahmā.
