===== Purport =====

Three words have been used in this connection to describe the achievement of Devahūti: //ātmānam, brahma-nirvāṇam// and //bhagavantam.// These refer to the gradual process of discovery of the Absolute Truth, mentioned herein as the //bhagavantam.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead resides in various Vaikuṇṭha planets. //Nirvāṇa// means to extinguish the pangs of material existence. When one is able to enter into the spiritual kingdom or into spiritual realization, one is automatically freed from material pangs. That is called //brahma-nirvāṇa.// According to Vedic scripture, //nirvāṇa// means cessation of the materialistic way of life. //Ātmānam// means realization of the Supersoul within the heart. Ultimately, the highest perfection is realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is to be understood that Devahūti entered the planet which is called Kapila Vaikuṇṭha. There are innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets predominated by the expansions of Viṣṇu. All the Vaikuṇṭha planets are known by a particular name of Viṣṇu. As we understand from //Brahma-saṁhitā, advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. //Ananta// means "innumerable." The Lord has innumerable expansions of His transcendental form, and according to the different positions of the symbolical representations in His four hands, He is known as Nārāyaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vāsudeva, etc. There is also a Vaikuṇṭha planet known as Kapila Vaikuṇṭha, to which Devahūti was promoted to meet Kapila and reside there eternally, enjoying the company of her transcendental son.
