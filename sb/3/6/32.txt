===== Purport =====

Human society's means of living is clearly mentioned here as //viśa,// or agriculture and the business of distributing agricultural products, which involves transport, banking, etc. Industry is an artificial means of livelihood, and large-scale industry especially is the source of all the problems of society. In //Bhagavad-gītā// also the duties of the //vaiśyas,// who are engaged in //viśa,// are stated as cow protection, agriculture and business. We have already discussed that the human being can safely depend on the cow and agricultural land for his livelihood.

The exchange of produce by banking and transportation is a branch of this type of living. The //vaiśyas// are divided into many subsections: some of them are called //kṣetrī,// or landowners, some are called //kṛṣaṇa,// or land tillers, some of them are called //tila-vaṇik,// or grain raisers, some are called //gandha-vaṇik,// or merchants in spices, and some are called //suvarṇa-vaṇik,// or merchants in gold and banking. The //brāhmaṇas// are the teachers and spiritual masters, the //kṣatriyas// protect the citizens from the hands of thieves and miscreants, and the //vaiśyas// are in charge of production and distribution. The //śūdras,// the unintelligent class of men who cannot act independently in any of the above-mentioned activities, are meant for serving the three higher classes for their livelihood.

Formerly, the //brāhmaṇas// were given all the necessities of life by the //kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas// because they had no time to spend making a living. The //kṣatriyas// would collect taxes from the //vaiśyas// and //śūdras,// but the //brāhmaṇas// were exempt from paying income tax or land revenue. That system of human society was so nice that there were no political, social and economic upheavals. The different castes, or //varṇa// classifications, are therefore essential for maintaining a peaceful human society.
