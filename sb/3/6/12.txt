The mouth of the gigantic universal form of the Lord is the source of the speaking power. The director of the fire element is the controlling deity, or the //ādhidaiva.// The speeches delivered are //ādhyātma,// or bodily functions, and the subject matter of the speeches is material productions, or the //ādhibhūta// principle.
