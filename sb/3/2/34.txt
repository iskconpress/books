===== Purport =====

Before leaving the land of cows, Vṛndāvana, the Lord pleased His young girl friends, the transcendental //gopīs,// in His //rāsa-līlā// pastimes. Here Uddhava stopped his description of the Lord's activities.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Second Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa."
