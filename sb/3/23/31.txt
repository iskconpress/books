===== Purport =====

The word //kṛta-śiraḥ-snānam// appears here. According to the //smṛti-śāstra's// directions for daily duties, ladies are allowed to bathe daily up to the neck. The hair on the head does not necessarily have to be washed daily because the mass of wet hair may cause a cold. For ladies, therefore, taking a bath up to the neck is ordinarily prescribed, and they take a full bath only on certain occasions. On this occasion Devahūti took a full bath and washed her hair very nicely. When a lady takes an ordinary bath it is called //mala-snāna,// and when she takes a full bath, including the head, it is called //śiraḥ-snāna.// At this time she needs sufficient oil to smear on her head. That is the direction of the commentators of //smṛti-śāstra.//
