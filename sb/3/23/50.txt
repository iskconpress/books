===== Purport =====

Devahūti was so beautiful that her toenails appeared just like pearls, and as she scratched the ground it appeared as if pearls had been thrown on the ground. When a woman scratches the ground with her foot, it is a sign that her mind is very disturbed. These signs were sometimes exhibited by the //gopīs// before Kṛṣṇa. When the //gopīs// came in the dead of night and Kṛṣṇa asked them to return to their homes, the //gopīs// also scratched the ground like this because their minds were very disturbed.
