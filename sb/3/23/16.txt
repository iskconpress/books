**The palace looked charming, with beds, couches, fans and seats, all separately arranged in seven stories.**

===== Purport =====

It is understood from this verse that the castle had many stories. The words //upary upari vinyasta// indicate that skyscrapers are not newly invented. Even in those days, millions of years ago, the idea of building many-storied houses was current. They contained not merely one or two rooms, but many different apartments, and each was completely decorated with cushions, bedsteads, sitting places and carpets.
