===== Translation =====

**Immediately afterward, on the same day, Devahūti gave birth to nine female children, all charming in every limb and fragrant with the scent of the red lotus flower.**

===== Purport =====

Devahūti was too sexually excited, and therefore she discharged more ova, and nine daughters were born. It is said in the //smṛti-śāstra// as well as in the //Āyur-veda// that when the discharge of the male is greater, male children are begotten, but when the discharge of the female is greater, female children are begotten. It appears from the circumstances that Devahūti was more sexually excited, and therefore she had nine daughters at once. All the daughters, however, were very beautiful, and their bodies were nicely formed; each resembled a lotus flower and was fragrant like a lotus.
