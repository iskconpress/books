===== Translation =====

**The powerful Kardama Muni was the knower of everyone's heart, and he could grant whatever one desired. Knowing the spiritual soul, he regarded her as half of his body. Dividing himself into nine forms, he impregnated Devahūti with nine discharges of semen.**

===== Purport =====

Since Kardama Muni could understand that Devahūti wanted many children, at the first chance he begot nine children at one time. He is described here as //vibhu,// the most powerful master. By his yogic power he could at once produce nine daughters in the womb of Devahūti.
