===== Purport =====

The explanation of Sāṅkhya philosophy is described here in detail in the sense that the //virāṭ-puruṣa,// or the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the original source of all the various sense organs and their presiding deities. The relationship between the //virāṭ-puruṣa// and the presiding deities or the living entities is so intricate that simply by exercising the sense organs, which are related to their presiding deities, the //virāṭ-puruṣa// cannot be aroused. It is not possible to arouse the //virāṭ-puruṣa// or to link with the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead by material activities. Only by devotional service and detachment can one perform the process of linking with the Absolute.
