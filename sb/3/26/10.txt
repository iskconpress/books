**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The unmanifested eternal combination of the three modes is the cause of the manifest state and is called pradhāna. It is called prakṛti when in the manifested stage of existence.**

===== Purport =====

The Lord points out material nature in its subtle stage, which is called //pradhāna,// and He analyzes this //pradhāna.// The explanation of //pradhāna// and //prakṛti// is that //pradhāna// is the subtle, undifferentiated sum total of all material elements. Although they are undifferentiated, one can understand that the total material elements are contained therein. When the total material elements are manifested by the interaction of the three modes of material nature, the manifestation is called //prakṛti.// Impersonalists say that Brahman is without variegatedness and without differentiation. One may say that //pradhāna// is the Brahman stage, but actually the Brahman stage is not //pradhāna. pradhāna// is distinct from Brahman because in Brahman there is no existence of the material modes of nature. One may argue that the //mahat-tattva// is also different from //pradhāna// because in the //mahat-tattva// there are manifestations. The actual explanation of //pradhāna,// however, is given here: when the cause and effect are not clearly manifested (//avyakta//), the reaction of the total elements does not take place, and that stage of material nature is called //pradhāna.// P//radhāna// is not the time element because in the time element there are actions and reactions, creation and annihilation. Nor is it the //jīva,// or marginal potency of living entities, or designated, conditioned living entities, because the designations of the living entities are not eternal. One adjective used in this connection is //nitya,// which indicates eternality. Therefore the condition of material nature immediately previous to its manifestation is called //pradhāna.//
