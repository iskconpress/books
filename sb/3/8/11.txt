===== Translation =====

**Just like the strength of fire within fuel wood, the Lord remained within the water of dissolution, submerging all the living entities in their subtle bodies. He lay in the self-invigorated energy called kāla.**

===== Purport =====

After the three worlds---the upper, lower and middle planetary systems---merged into the water of dissolution, the living entities of all the three worlds remained in their subtle bodies by dint of the energy called //kāla.// In this dissolution, the gross bodies became unmanifest, but the subtle bodies existed, just like the water of the material creation. Thus the material energy was not completely wound up, as is the case in the full dissolution of the material world.
