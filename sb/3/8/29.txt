===== Translation =====

**As a sandalwood tree is decorated with fragrant flowers and branches, the Lord's body was decorated with valuable jewels and pearls. He was the self-situated tree, the Lord of all others in the universe. And as a sandalwood tree is covered with many snakes, so the Lord's body was also covered by the hoods of Ananta.**

===== Purport =====

The word //avyakta-mūlam// is significant here. Generally, no one can see the roots of a tree. But as far as the Lord is concerned, He is the root of Himself because there is no other separate cause of His standing but He Himself. In the //Vedas// it is said that the Lord is //svāśrayāśraya;// He is His own support, and there is no other support for Him. Therefore, //avyakta// means the Supreme Lord Himself and no one else.
