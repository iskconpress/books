===== Translation =====

**The great sage Parāśara, as aforementioned, being so advised by the great sage Pulastya, spoke unto me the foremost of the Purāṇas [Bhāgavatam]. I shall also describe this before you, my dear son, in terms of my hearing, because you are always my faithful follower.**

===== Purport =====

The great sage of the name Pulastya is the father of all demoniac descendants. Once upon a time Parāśara began a sacrifice in which all the demons were to be burnt to death because his father had been killed and devoured by one of them. The great sage Vasiṣṭha Muni arrived at the sacrifice and requested Parāśara to stop the deadly action, and because of Vasiṣṭha's position and respect in the community of sages, Parāśara could not deny the request. Parāśara having stopped the sacrifice, Pulastya, the father of the demons, appreciated his brahminical temperament and gave the blessing that in the future he would be a great speaker on the Vedic literatures called the //Purāṇas,// the supplements of the //Vedas.// Parāśara's action was appreciated by Pulastya because Parāśara had forgiven the demons out of his brahminical power of forgiveness. Parāśara was able to demolish all the demons in the sacrifice, but he considered, "Demons are so made that they devour living creatures, men and animals, but why on that account should I withdraw my brahminical qualification of forgiveness?" As the great speaker of the //Purāṇas,// Parāśara first of all spoke on the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata Purāṇa// because it is the foremost of all the //Purāṇas.// Maitreya Muni desired to narrate the same //Bhāgavatam// be had heard from Parāśara, and Vidura was qualified to hear it because of his faithfulness and his following the instructions received from superiors. So //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was being narrated from time immemorial by the disciplic succession, even before the time of Vyāsadeva. The so-called historians calculate the //Purāṇas// to be only a few hundred years old, but factually the //Purāṇas// existed from time immemorial, before all historical calculations by the mundaners and speculative philosophers.
