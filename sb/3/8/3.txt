This is in clarification of the statement that the Lord spoke directly on the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// When and unto whom the //Bhāgavatam// was spoken is explained herewith. Questions similar to those put forward by Vidura were asked by great sages like Sanat-kumāra, and Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Lord Vāsudeva, answered them.
