===== Purport =====

The process of //yoga// is very clearly described in this verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is said here that the ultimate end of the //yogīs// and mystics who perform meditation is to get rid of this material body. Therefore they meditate in secluded places to attain yogic trance. //Yoga// has to be performed in a secluded place, not in public or in a demonstration on stage, as nowadays practiced by many so-called //yogīs.// Real //yoga// aims at ridding one of the material body. //Yoga// practice is not intended to keep the body fit and young. Such advertisements of so-called //yoga// are not approved by any standard method. Particularly mentioned in this verse is the word //yam,// or "unto whom," indicating that meditation should be targeted on the Personality of Godhead. Even if one concentrates his mind on the boar form of the Lord, that is also //yoga.// As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā,// one who concentrates his mind constantly in meditation upon the Personality of Godhead in one of His many varieties of forms is the first-class //yogī,// and he can very easily attain trance simply by meditating upon the form of the Lord. If one is able to continue such meditation on the Lord's form at the time of one's death, one is liberated from this mortal body and is transferred to the kingdom of God. This opportunity was given to the demon by the Lord, and therefore Brahmā and other demigods were astonished. In other words, the perfection of //yoga// practice can be attained by a demon also if he is simply kicked by the Lord.
