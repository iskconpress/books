===== Translation =====

**The Lord, the personal enjoyer of all sacrifices, now discharged His beloved Sudarśana, which was capable of dispersing the magical forces displayed by the demon.**

===== Purport =====

Even famous //yogīs// and demons can sometimes enact very magical feats by their mystic power, but in the presence of the Sudarśana //cakra,// when it is let loose by the Lord, all such magical jugglery is dispersed. The instance of the quarrel between Durvāsā Muni and Mahārāja Ambarīṣa is a practical example in this matter. Durvāsā Muni wanted to display many magical wonders, but when the Sudarśana //cakra// appeared, Durvāsā himself was afraid and fled to various planets for his personal protection. The Lord is described here as //tri-pāt,// which means that He is the enjoyer of three kinds of sacrifices. In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Lord confirms that He is the beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices, penances and austerities. The Lord is the enjoyer of three kinds of //yajña.// As further described in //Bhagavad-gītā,// there are sacrifices of goods, sacrifices of meditation and sacrifices of philosophical speculation. Those on the paths of //jñāna, yoga// and //karma// all have to come in the end to the Supreme Lord because //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]---the Supreme Lord is the ultimate enjoyer of everything. That is the perfection of all sacrifice.
