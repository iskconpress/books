**That is why the brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas protect each other, as well as themselves; and the Lord Himself, who is both the cause and effect and is yet immutable, protects them through each other.**

===== Purport =====

The entire social structure of //varṇa// and //āśrama// is a cooperative system meant to uplift all to the highest platform of spiritual realization. The //brāhmaṇas// are intended to be protected by the //kṣatriyas,// and the //kṣatriyas// also are intended to be enlightened by the //brāhmaṇas.// When the //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// cooperate nicely, the other subordinate divisions, the //vaiśyas,// or mercantile people, and the //śūdras,// or laborer class, automatically flourish. The entire elaborate system of Vedic society was therefore based on the importance of the //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas.// The Lord is the real protector, but He is unattached to the affairs of protection. He creates //brāhmaṇas// for the protection of the //kṣatriyas,// and //kṣatriyas// for the protection of the //brāhmaṇas.// He remains aloof from all activities; therefore, He is called //nirvikāra,// "without activity." He has nothing to do. He is so great that He does not perform action personally, but His energies act. The //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas,// and anything that we see, are different energies acting upon one another.

Although individual souls are all different, the Superself, or Supersoul, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Individually one's self may differ from others in certain qualities and may engage in different activities, such as those of a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya,// but when there is complete cooperation among different individual souls, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul, Paramātmā, being one in every individual soul, is pleased and gives them all protection. As stated before, the //brāhmaṇas// are produced from the mouth of the Lord, and the //kṣatriyas// are produced from the chest or arms of the Lord. If the different castes or social sections, although apparently differently occupied in different activities, nevertheless act in full cooperation, then the Lord is pleased. This is the idea of the institution of four //varṇas// and four //āśramas.// If the members of different //āśramas// and //varṇas// cooperate fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then society is well protected by the Lord, without doubt.

In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is stated that the Lord is the proprietor of all different bodies. The individual soul is the proprietor of his individual body, but the Lord clearly states, "My dear Bhārata, you must know that I am also //kṣetra jña. " Kṣetra jña// means "the knower or proprietor of the body." The individual soul is the proprietor of the individual body, but the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the proprietor of all bodies everywhere. He is the proprietor not only of human bodies but of birds, beasts and all other entities, not only on this planet but on other planets also. He is the supreme proprietor; therefore He does not become divided by protecting the different individual souls. He remains one and the same. That the sun appears on top of everyone's head when at the meridian does not imply that the sun becomes divided. One man thinks that the sun is on his head only, whereas five thousand miles away another man is thinking that the sun is only on his head. Similarly, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is one, but He appears to individually oversee each individual soul. This does not mean that the individual soul and the Supersoul are one. They are one in quality, as spirit soul, but the individual soul and Supersoul are different.
