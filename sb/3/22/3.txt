===== Translation =====

**For the protection of the brāhmaṇas, the thousand-legged Supreme Being created us, the kṣatriyas, from His thousand arms. Hence the brāhmaṇas are said to be His heart and the kṣatriyas His arms.**

===== Purport =====

//Kṣatriyas// are specifically meant to maintain the //brāhmaṇas// because if the //brāhmaṇas// are protected, then the head of civilization is protected. //Brāhmaṇas// are supposed to be the head of the social body; if the head is clear and has not gone mad, then everything is in proper position. The Lord is described thus: //namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// The purport of this prayer is that the Lord specifically protects the //brāhmaṇas// and the cows, and then He protects all other members of society (//jagad-dhitāya//). It is His will that universal welfare work depends on the protection of cows and //brāhmaṇas;// thus brahminical culture and cow protection are the basic principles for human civilization. //Kṣatriyas// are especially meant to protect the //brāhmaṇas,// as is the supreme will of the Lord: //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// As, within the body, the heart is a very important part, so the //brāhmaṇas// are also the important element in human society. The //kṣatriyas// are more like the whole body; even though the whole body is bigger than the heart, the heart is more important.
