===== Translation =====

**Empress Śatarūpā lovingly gave most valuable presents, suitable for the occasion, such as jewelry, clothes and household articles, in dowry to the bride and bridegroom.**

===== Purport =====

The custom of giving one's daughter in charity with a dowry is still current in India. The gifts are given according to the position of the father of the bride. //Pāribarhān mahā-dhanān// means the dowry which must be awarded to the bridegroom at the time of marriage. Here //mahā-dhanān// means greatly valuable gifts befitting the dowry of an empress. The words //bhūṣā-vāsaḥ paricchadān// also appear here. //Bhūṣā// means "ornaments," //vāsaḥ// means "clothing," and //paricchadān// means "various household articles." All things befitting the marriage ceremony of an emperor's daughter were awarded to Kardama Muni, who was until now observing celibacy as a //brahmacārī.// The bride, Devahūti, was very richly dressed with ornaments and clothing.

In this way Kardama Muni was married with full opulence to a qualified wife and was endowed with the necessary paraphernalia for household life. In the Vedic way of marriage such a dowry is still given to the bridegroom by the father of the bride; even in poverty-stricken India there are marriages where hundreds and thousands of rupees are spent for a dowry. The dowry system is not illegal, as some have tried to prove. The dowry is a gift given to the daughter by the father to show good will, and it is compulsory. In rare cases where the father is completely unable to give a dowry, it is enjoined that he must at least give a fruit and a flower. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// God can also be pleased even by a fruit and a flower. When there is financial inability and no question of accumulating a dowry by another means, one can give a fruit and flower for the satisfaction of the bridegroom.
