**Svāyambhuva Manu continued: O wise man, I heard that you were prepared to marry. Please accept her hand, which is being offered to you by me, since you have not taken a vow of perpetual celibacy.**

===== Purport =====

The principle of //brahmacarya// is celibacy. There are two kinds of //brahmacārīs.// One is called //naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī,// which means one who takes a vow of celibacy for his whole life, whereas the other, the //upakurvāṇa-brahmacārī,// is a //brahmacārī// who takes the vow of celibacy up to a certain age. For example, he may take the vow to remain celibate up to twenty-five years of age; then, with the permission of his spiritual master, he enters married life. //Brahmacarya// is student life, the beginning of life in the spiritual orders, and the principle of //brahmacarya// is celibacy. Only a householder can indulge in sense gratification or sex life, not a //brahmacārī.// Svāyambhuva Manu requested Kardama Muni to accept his daughter, since Kardama had not taken the vow of //naiṣṭhika-brahmacarya.// He was willing to marry, and the suitable daughter of a high royal family was presented.
