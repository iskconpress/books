===== Translation =====

**To each one of these sons the unborn creator of the universe gave a part of his own body, which was characterized by deep meditation, mental concentration, supernatural power, austerity, adoration and renunciation.**

===== Purport =====

The word //viraktimat// in this verse means "possessed of the qualification of renunciation." Spiritual realization cannot be attained by materialistic persons. For those who are addicted to sense enjoyment, spiritual realization is not possible. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is stated that those who are too attached to seeking material possessions and material enjoyment cannot reach //yoga-samādhi,// absorption in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Propaganda that one can enjoy this life materially and at the same time spiritually advance is simply bogus. The principles of renunciation are four: (1) to avoid illicit sex life, (2) to avoid meat-eating, (3) to avoid intoxication and (4) to avoid gambling. These four principles are called //tapasya,// or austerity. To absorb the mind in the Supreme in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process of spiritual realization.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Conversation Between Maitreya and Vidura."
