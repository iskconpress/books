===== Purport =====

Significant here is the word //avyakta-mārga-vit,// "one who knows that which is beyond our perception." To know matters beyond one's perception, one has to learn from a superior authority in the line of disciplic succession. Just to know who is our father is beyond our perception. For that, the mother is the authority. Similarly, we have to understand everything beyond our perception from the authority who actually knows. The first //avyakta-mārga-vit,// or authority, is Brahmā, and the next authority in disciplic succession is Nārada. Maitreya Ṛṣi belongs to that disciplic succession, so he also is //avyakta-mārga-vit.// Anyone in the bona fide line of disciplic succession is //avyakta-mārga-vit,// a personality who knows that which is beyond ordinary perception.
