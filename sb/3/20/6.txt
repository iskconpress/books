===== Translation =====

**O Sūta Gosvāmī, all good fortune to you! Please narrate the activities of the Lord, which are all magnanimous and worth glorifying. What sort of devotee can be satiated by hearing the nectarean pastimes of the Lord?**

===== Purport =====

The narration of the pastimes of the Lord, which are always enacted on the transcendental platform, should be received with all respect by devotees. Those who are actually on the transcendental platform are never satiated by hearing the continuous narration of the pastimes of the Lord. For example, if any self-realized soul reads from //Bhagavad-gītā,// he will never feel satiated. The narrations of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// may be read thousands and thousands of times, and still, without fail, new aspects of the subject matter will be relished by the devotee.
