===== Translation =====

**O great sage, kindly describe the divisions and orders of human society in terms of symptoms, behavior and the characteristics of mental equilibrium and sense control. Also please describe the births of the great sages and the categorical divisions of the Vedas.**

===== Purport =====

The four statuses and orders of human society---//brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras,// as wall as //brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs//---are all divisions of quality, education, culture and spiritual advancement attained by practicing control of the mind and the senses. All these divisions are based on the particular nature of each individual person, not on the principle of birth. Birth is not mentioned in this verse because birth is immaterial. Vidura is famous in history as born of a //śūdrāṇī// mother, yet he is more than a //brāhmaṇa// by qualification because he is seen here to be the disciple of a great sage, Maitreya Muni. Unless one achieves at least the brahminical qualifications, one cannot understand the Vedic hymns. //Mahābhārata// is also a division of the //Vedas,// but it is meant for women, //śūdras// and //dvija-bandhus,// the worthless children of the higher section. The less intelligent section of society can avail themselves of the Vedic instructions simply by studying the //Mahābhārata.//
