===== Purport =====

All religious activities are meant ultimately to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is the father of all religious principles. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:16|(Bg. 7.16)]], four kinds of pious men---the needy, the distressed, the enlightened and the inquisitive---approach the Lord in devotional service, and their devotion is mixed with material affection. But above them are the pure devotees, whose devotion is not tainted by any material tinges of fruitive work or speculative knowledge. Those who are only miscreants throughout their lives are compared to demons [[books:bg:7:15|(Bg. 7.15)]]. They are bereft of all knowledge, in spite of any academic educational career they may pursue. Such miscreants are never candidates for satisfying the Lord.
