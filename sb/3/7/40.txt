===== Purport =====

Vidura put forward many varieties of questions with a view to understanding the principles of transcendental loving service to the Lord. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:41|(Bg. 2.41)]], devotional service to the Lord is one, and the mind of the devotee is not diverted to the many branches of uncertainties. Vidura's purpose was to be situated in that service to the Lord, wherein one merges undivertedly. He claimed the friendship of Maitreya Muni, not because he was Maitreya's son but because Maitreya was actually the friend of all who have lost their spiritual vision due to material influence.
