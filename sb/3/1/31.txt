===== Translation =====

**O Uddhava, does Yuyudhāna fare well? He learned the intricacies of the military art from Arjuna and attained the transcendental destination which is very difficult to reach even for great renouncers.**

===== Purport =====

The destination of transcendence is to become the personal associate of the Personality of Godhead, who is known as //adhokṣaja,// He who is beyond the reach of the senses. The renouncers of the world, the //sannyāsīs,// give up all worldly connections, namely, family, wife, children, friends, home, wealth---everything---to attain the transcendental bliss of Brahman happiness. But //adhokṣaja// happiness is beyond Brahman happiness. The empiric philosophers enjoy a transcendental quality of bliss by philosophical speculation on the Supreme Truth, but beyond that pleasure is the pleasure enjoyed by Brahman in His eternal form of the Personality of Godhead. Brahman bliss is enjoyed by living entities after liberation from material bondage. But Parabrahman, the Personality of Godhead, enjoys eternally a bliss of His own potency, which is called the //hlādinī// potency. The empiric philosopher who studies Brahman by negation of the external features has not yet learned the quality of the //hlādinī// potency of Brahman. Out of many potencies of the Omnipotent, there are three features of His internal potency---namely //saṁvit, sandhinī// and //hlādinī.// And in spite of their strict adherence to the principles of //yama, niyama, āsana, dhyāna, dhāraṇā// and //prāṇāyāma,// the great //yogīs// and //jñānīs// are unable to enter into the internal potency of the Lord. This internal potency is, however, easily realized by the devotees of the Lord by dint of devotional service. Yuyudhāna achieved this stage of life, just as he achieved expert knowledge in military science from Arjuna. Thus his life was successful to the fullest extent from both the material and spiritual angles of vision. That is the way of devotional service to the Lord.
