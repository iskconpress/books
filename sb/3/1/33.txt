===== Translation =====

**As the Vedas are the reservoir of sacrificial purposes, so the daughter of King Devaka-bhoja conceived the Supreme Personality of Godhead in her womb, as did the mother of the demigods. Is she [Devakī] doing well?**

===== Purport =====

The //Vedas// are full of transcendental knowledge and spiritual values, and thus Devakī, the mother of Lord Kṛṣṇa, conceived the Lord in her womb as the personified meaning of the //Vedas.// There is no difference between the //Vedas// and the Lord. The //Vedas// aim at the understanding of the Lord, and the Lord is the //Vedas// personified. Devakī is compared to the meaningful //Vedas// and the Lord to their purpose personified.
