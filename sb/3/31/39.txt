===== Purport =====

The culmination of //yoga// is full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is affirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā:// a person who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa in devotion is the topmost of all //yogīs.// And in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// it is also stated that when one becomes freed from material contamination by rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at that time understand the science of God.

Here the word //pratilabdhātma-lābhaḥ// occurs. //Ātmā// means "self," and //lābha// means "gain." Generally, conditioned souls have lost their //ātmā,// or self, but those who are transcendentalists have realized the self. It is directed that such a self-realized soul who aspires to the topmost platform of yogic perfection should not associate with young women. In the modern age, however, there are so many rascals who recommend that while one has genitals he should enjoy women as much as he likes, and at the same time he can become a //yogī.// In no standard //yoga// system is the association of women accepted. It is clearly stated here that the association of women is the gateway to hellish life. The association of woman is very much restricted in the Vedic civilization. Out of the four social divisions, the //brahmacārī, vānaprastha// and the //sannyāsī//---three orders---are strictly prohibited from the association of women; only the //gṛhasthas,// or householders, are given license to have an intimate relationship with a woman, and that relationship is also restricted for begetting nice children. If, however, one wants to stick to continued existence in the material world, he may indulge in female association unrestrictedly.
