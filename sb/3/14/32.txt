**Thereafter the brāhmaṇa took his bath in the water and controlled his speech by practicing trance, meditating on the eternal effulgence and chanting the holy Gāyatrī hymns within his mouth.**

===== Purport =====

As one has to take bath after using the toilet, so one has to wash himself with water after sexual intercourse, especially when at a forbidden time. Kaśyapa Muni meditated on the impersonal //brahmajyoti// by chanting the Gāyatrī //mantra// within his mouth. When a Vedic //mantra// is chanted within the mouth so that only the chanter can hear, the chanting is called //japa.// But when such //mantras// are chanted loudly, it is called //kīrtana.// The Vedic hymn Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare can be chanted both softly to oneself or loudly; therefore it is called the //mahā-mantra,// or the great hymn.

Kaśyapa Muni appears to be an impersonalist. Comparing his character with that of Ṭhākura Haridāsa as referred to above, it is clear that the personalist is stronger in sense control than the impersonalist. This is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// as //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate;// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 9.59]]] i.e., one ceases to accept lower grade things when one is situated in a superior condition. One is supposed to be purified after taking bath and chanting Gāyatrī, but the //mahā-mantra// is so powerful that one can chant loudly or softly, in any condition, and he is protected from all the evils of material existence.
