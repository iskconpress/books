===== Translation =====

**As a fort commander very easily conquers invading plunderers, by taking shelter of a wife one can conquer the senses, which are unconquerable in the other social orders.**

===== Purport =====

Of the four orders of human society---the student, or //brahmacārī// order, the householder, or //gṛhastha// order, the retired, or //vānaprastha// order, and the renounced, or //sannyāsī// order---the householder is on the safe side. The bodily senses are considered plunderers of the fort of the body. The wife is supposed to be the commander of the fort, and therefore whenever there is an attack on the body by the senses, it is the wife who protects the body from being smashed. The sex demand is inevitable for everyone, but one who has a fixed wife is saved from the onslaught of the sense enemies. A man who possesses a good wife does not create a disturbance in society by corrupting virgin girls. Without a fixed wife, a man becomes a debauchee of the first order and is a nuisance in society---unless he is a trained //brahmacārī, vānaprastha// or //sannyāsī.// Unless there is rigid and systematic training of the //brahmacārī// by the expert spiritual master, and unless the student is obedient, it is sure that the so-called //brahmacārī// will fall prey to the attack of sex. There are so many instances of falldown, even for great //yogīs// like Viśvāmitra. A //gṛhastha// is saved, however, because of his faithful wife. Sex life is the cause of material bondage, and therefore it is prohibited in three //āśramas// and is allowed only in the //gṛhastha-āśrama.// The //gṛhastha// is responsible for producing first-quality //brahmacārīs, vānaprasthas// and //sannyāsīs.//
