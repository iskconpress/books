**The four divisions of retired life are the vaikhānasas, vālakhilyas, audumbaras and phenapas. The four divisions of the renounced order of life are the kuṭīcakas, bahvodas, haṁsas and niṣkriyas. All these were manifested from Brahmā.**

===== Purport =====

The //varṇāśrama-dharma,// or the institution of the four divisions and orders of social and spiritual life, is not a new invention of the modern age, as proposed by the less intelligent. It is an institution established by Brahmā from the beginning of the creation. This is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:13|(Bg. 4.13)]]: //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam.//
