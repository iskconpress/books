===== Translation =====

**Then he created the fifth Veda---the Purāṇas and the histories---from all his mouths, since he could see all the past, present and future.**

===== Purport =====

There are histories of particular countries and nations and of the world, but the //Purāṇas// are the histories of the universe, not only in one millennium, but in many //kalpas.// Brahmā has knowledge of those historical facts, and therefore all the //purāṇas// are histories. As originally composed by Brahmā, they are part of the //Vedas// and are called the fifth //Veda.//
