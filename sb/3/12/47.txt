**Brahmā's soul was manifested as the touch alphabets, his body as the vowels, his senses as the sibilant alphabets, his strength as the intermediate alphabets and his sensual activities as the seven notes of music.**

===== Purport =====

In Sanskrit there are thirteen vowels and thirty-five consonants. The vowels are //a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ, ḷ, e, ai, o, au,// and the consonants are //ka, kha, ga, gha,// etc. Amongst the consonants, the first twenty-five letters are called the //sparśas.// There are also four //antaḥ-sthas.// Of the //ūṣmas// there are three //s//'s, called //tālavya, mūrdhanya// and //dantya.// The musical notes are //ṣa, ṛ, gā, ma, dha,// and //ni.// All these sound vibrations are originally called //śabda-brahma,// or spiritual sound. It is said, therefore, that Brahmā was created in the Mahā-kalpa as the incarnation of spiritual sound. The //Vedas// are spiritual sound, and therefore there is no need of material interpretation for the sound vibration of the Vedic literature. The Vedas should be vibrated as they are, although they are symbolically represented with letters which are known to us materially. In the ultimate issue there is nothing material because everything has its origin in the spiritual world. The material manifestation is therefore called illusion in the proper sense of the term. For those who are realized souls there is nothing but spirit.
