===== Purport =====

The history of the creation of the population of the universe is given herewith. Brahmā is the original living creature in the universe, from whom were generated the Manu Svāyambhuva and his wife Śatarūpā. From Manu, two sons and three daughters were born, and from them all the population in different planets has sprung up until now. Therefore, Brahmā is known as the grandfather of everyone, and the Personality of Godhead, being the father of Brahmā, is known as the great-grandfather of all living beings. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:11:39|(Bg. 11.39)]] as follows:

> vāyur yamo 'gnir varuṇaḥ śaśāṅkaḥ
> prajāpatis tvaṁ prapitāmahaś ca
> namo namas te 'stu sahasra-kṛtvaḥ
> punaś ca bhūyo 'pi namo namas te

"You are the Lord of air, the supreme justice Yama, the fire, and the Lord of rains. You are the moon, and You are the great-grandfather. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You again and again."

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Creation of the Kumāras and Others."
