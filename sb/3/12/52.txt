===== Translation =====

**While he was thus absorbed in contemplation and was observing the supernatural power, two other forms were generated from his body. They are still celebrated as the body of Brahmā.**

===== Purport =====

Two bodies came out from the body of Brahmā. One had a mustache, and the other had swollen breasts. No one can explain the source of their manifestation, and therefore until today they are known as the //kāyam,// or the body of Brahmā, with no indication of their relationship as his son or daughter.
