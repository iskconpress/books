<blockquote>
"This is a work to be treasured. No one of whatever faith or philosophical persuasion who reads these books with an open mind can fail to be both moved and impressed..."
<cite>Dr. Garry Gelade\\ Professor of Psychology\\ Oxford University</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>
"It has been my great pleasure recently to have read the Srimad-Bhagavatam in the superb edition authorized by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. ... I am sure this monumental work will go far to bring the sublime message of the Bhagavatam to numerous Westerners who otherwise would miss this opportunity."
<cite>Dr. Alex Wayman\\ Professor of Sanskrit, Columbia University</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>
"The Srimad-Bhagavatam is extremely useful for all those interested in ancient India, whether their interest be that of the philosopher, the student of religion, the historian, the linguist, the sociologist or the political scientist. ... I truly hope that Srila Prabhupada will complete his translation of the entire Bhagavata and continue to translate other eminent Sanskrit works as well. Undoubtedly, this work of Swamiji's is a great contribution to the troubled human society of today's world."
<cite>Dr. Sooda L. Bhatt\\ Professor of Indian Languages, Boston University</cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>
"The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust editions of famous religious classics of India, with new translations and commentaries, are an important addition to our expanding knowledge of spiritual India. The new edition of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is particularly welcome."
